# Complete SBIR Data Fix - What Was Implemented

## üéØ Issues From Screenshots - STATUS

### ‚úÖ FIXED - Now Calculated/Populated:

1. **days_until_close** - ‚úÖ Calculated from topicEndDate
2. **days_since_open** - ‚úÖ Calculated from topicStartDate  
3. **days_until_close_1** (duplicate) - ‚úÖ Mapped
4. **urgency_level** - ‚úÖ Calculated (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
5. **duration_days** - ‚úÖ Calculated (topicEndDate - topicStartDate)
6. **pre_release_duration** - ‚úÖ Calculated (preReleaseEnd - preReleaseStart)
7. **last_activity_date** - ‚úÖ Calculated (max of updated/modified/qaEnd)
8. **solicitation_phase** - ‚úÖ Extracted from cycle_name (Phase I/II/III)
9. **proposal_window_status** - ‚úÖ Calculated (Not Open/Open/Closed)
10. **days_until_qa_close** - ‚úÖ Calculated from topicQAEndDate
11. **qa_response_rate_percentage** - ‚úÖ Calculated (published/total * 100)
12. **qa_window_active** - ‚úÖ Calculated (Yes/No based on current date)
13. **qa_content_fetched** - ‚úÖ Set to Yes/No
14. **qa_last_updated** - ‚úÖ Timestamp when Q&A was fetched
15. **is_xtech_xtech_keyword_search_duplicate** - ‚úÖ Now defaults to "No" (not NULL)
16. **prize_gating** - ‚úÖ Now defaults to "Yes" or "No" (not NULL)
17. **phases_available** - ‚úÖ Extracted (Phase I, Phase II, Phase III)
18. **is_direct_to_phase_ii** - ‚úÖ Detected from descriptions, defaults to "No"
19. **topic_pdf_download** - ‚úÖ Constructed from topicId
20. **pdf_link** - ‚úÖ Same as topic_pdf_download

### ‚ö†Ô∏è STILL MISSING (API Doesn't Provide):

1. **created_date** - API returns this, but may be NULL for some topics
2. **updated_date** - API returns this, but may be NULL for some topics
3. **modified_date** - API returns this, but may be NULL for some topics
4. **TPOC fields** - Only visible during Pre-Release status (by design)
   - Will be populated when topics are Pre-Release
   - Will be preserved after topics go Open

### ‚ùì NEEDS CLARIFICATION:

1. **description_2 through description_11** - What should these contain?
   - description_1 = main description
   - description_3 = phase1Description
   - description_4 = phase2Description
   - description_5/6 = phase3Description
   - What are description_2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 supposed to be?

2. **Funding information** - Not in API response
   - Phase I/II funding amounts not in public API
   - May need to parse from descriptions or BAA documents

3. **keywords_2, keywords_3, keywords_4** - Duplicates? What's the difference?

4. **Component fields (component_1, component_2, component_3, component_4, component_5)** - Different component types?

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS:

### Step 1: Add Missing Columns (1 minute)
Run these SQL scripts in Supabase:
```bash
1. ADD_COMPONENT_INSTRUCTIONS_COLUMN.sql
2. ADD_CALCULATED_FIELD_COLUMNS.sql
```

### Step 2: Re-Run Scraper (2-3 minutes)
1. Go to `https://prop-shop.ai/admin/dsip-settings`
2. Click "Trigger Manual Scrape"
3. Wait for completion

### Step 3: Verify Results
Check these fields are now populated:
- ‚úÖ days_until_close (should show numbers like 18, 28, etc.)
- ‚úÖ days_since_open (should show large numbers like 5793)
- ‚úÖ duration_days (should show numbers)
- ‚úÖ solicitation_phase (should show "Phase I")
- ‚úÖ urgency_level (should show "Low", "Medium", etc.)
- ‚úÖ qanda_start/end dates (should show dates for topics with Q&A)
- ‚úÖ is_xtech = "No" (not NULL) for non-xTech topics
- ‚úÖ prize_gating = "No" (not NULL) for non-xTech topics
- ‚úÖ pdf_link (should show URL)

### Step 4: TPOC Verification
- TPOC will ONLY populate for Pre-Release topics
- Once a topic goes Open, TPOC disappears from API
- Your database will PRESERVE the TPOC data captured during pre-release
- This is a COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

## üìä Expected Data Quality After Fix:

| Field Category | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Date Calculations | 0% | 100% |
| Q&A Calculations | 0% | 100% |
| Phase Information | 0% | 100% |
| Boolean Defaults | NULL | "Yes"/"No" |
| PDF Links | 0% | 100% |
| TPOC Data | 0% | 90% (Pre-Release only) |
| Urgency Levels | 0% | 100% |
| Window Status | 0% | 100% |

## ü§î Questions For You:

1. **Description fields 2, 7-11** - What should populate these? Do you want to split the main description into multiple parts?

2. **Funding amounts** - Do you want to parse Phase I/II amounts from descriptions? (e.g., "$250,000 Phase I")

3. **Multiple keyword columns** - Should keywords_2, keywords_3, keywords_4 be different formats of the same data?

4. **Component variations** - What's the difference between component, component_1, component_2, etc.?

5. **Data type standardization** - Should we convert some TEXT fields to proper types (INTEGER for days, BOOLEAN for yes/no)?

## üí° Recommendation:

After you run the SQL scripts and re-scrape, share a screenshot of the updated data. I'll then identify any remaining gaps and create targeted fixes!
