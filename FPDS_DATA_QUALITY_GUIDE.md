# FPDS Data Quality & Cleaning System

## Overview

Federal contract data is **notoriously messy**! The FPDS scraper now includes comprehensive data cleaning and validation to ensure you get **maximum data while filtering garbage**.

---

## 🧹 What Gets Cleaned?

### 1. Company Names (CRITICAL!)

**Problem:** Same company, 10 different spellings
- "IBM CORP"
- "IBM Corporation"
- "International Business Machines"
- "I.B.M."
- "IBM, INC"

**Solution:**
- ✅ Normalizes to uppercase
- ✅ Removes extra spaces/punctuation
- ✅ Generates fuzzy-match key for deduplication
- ✅ **Keeps original name** but adds `vendor_name_key` for matching

**Example:**
```typescript
"IBM Corporation" → vendor_name_key: "IBM"
"I.B.M. Corp." → vendor_name_key: "IBM"
// Same key = same company!
```

---

### 2. Dollar Amounts

**Problems:**
- ❌ Negative values ($-500,000)
- ❌ Astronomical errors ($999,999,999,999)
- ❌ NaN/Infinity
- ❌ Too many decimals ($1234.56789)

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removes negative amounts (invalid for federal contracts)
- ✅ Flags amounts > $10 billion as suspicious
- ✅ Rounds to 2 decimals
- ✅ Validates all amount fields
- ✅ Adds **amount category** (micro/small/medium/large/major/mega)

**Amount Categories:**
- **Micro:** < $25K
- **Small:** $25K - $100K
- **Medium:** $100K - $1M
- **Large:** $1M - $10M
- **Major:** $10M - $100M
- **Mega:** > $100M

---

### 3. Dates

**Problems:**
- ❌ Invalid dates ("0000-00-00")
- ❌ Contracts from 1800s
- ❌ End date before start date
- ❌ Contracts lasting 50 years

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removes dates before 1990 (too old)
- ✅ Removes dates > 20 years in future (data errors)
- ✅ Validates date ranges (end must be after start)
- ✅ Flags contracts > 10 years as unusual
- ✅ Handles multiple date formats

---

### 4. NAICS Codes

**Problems:**
- ❌ Invalid codes (letters, wrong length)
- ❌ Outdated codes
- ❌ Extra characters ("541715-A")

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removes non-digits
- ✅ Validates length (2-6 digits)
- ✅ Keeps valid codes only

---

### 5. UEI/DUNS Numbers

**Problems:**
- ❌ Wrong length
- ❌ Invalid characters
- ❌ Multiple formats

**Solution:**
- ✅ UEI: Must be exactly 12 alphanumeric characters
- ✅ DUNS: Must be exactly 9 digits
- ✅ Removes invalid identifiers

---

### 6. Text Fields (Descriptions, etc.)

**Problems:**
- ❌ Multiple spaces "LEASE  OF   CONTAINERS"
- ❌ Newlines/tabs in middle of text
- ❌ Extremely long descriptions (> 10,000 chars)

**Solution:**
- ✅ Normalizes whitespace
- ✅ Removes newlines/tabs
- ✅ Truncates to reasonable length
- ✅ Trims leading/trailing spaces

---

### 7. Location Data

**Problems:**
- ❌ State codes with wrong format ("California" vs "CA")
- ❌ Invalid zip codes
- ❌ Mixed case city names

**Solution:**
- ✅ Normalizes state codes (2 uppercase letters)
- ✅ Cleans city names
- ✅ Validates zip codes

---

## 📊 Data Quality Scoring

Every contract gets a **quality score (0-100)**:

### Score Breakdown

**Start:** 100 points

**Deductions:**
- ❌ Missing vendor name: **-30 points** (CRITICAL)
- ❌ Missing contract ID: **-30 points** (CRITICAL)
- ⚠️ Missing contract value: **-10 points**
- ⚠️ Missing NAICS code: **-5 points**
- ⚠️ Missing dates: **-5 points**
- ⚠️ Missing UEI/DUNS: **-5 points**
- ⚠️ Missing agency: **-5 points**

### Quality Tiers

| Score | Tier | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| **80-100** | High Quality | Complete, reliable data |
| **60-79** | Medium Quality | Usable but missing some fields |
| **0-59** | Low Quality | Missing critical data |

---

## 🚩 Suspicious Data Flagging

Contracts are flagged as **suspicious** if:

1. ⚠️ Vendor name < 3 characters (likely data error)
2. ⚠️ Mega contract (> $100M) with no description
3. ⚠️ Invalid date ranges
4. ⚠️ Extreme anomalies

**Suspicious contracts** are:
- ✅ Still saved to database
- ✅ Flagged for manual review
- ✅ Excluded from `fpds_high_quality_contracts` view

---

## 🔍 Duplicate Detection

The system detects likely duplicates:

### Duplicate Criteria

**100% Match:** Same PIID (contract ID)
**95% Match:** Same vendor + same amount + same date

### Deduplication Strategy

**During scrape:**
- Uses `transaction_number` as unique key
- Upserts (updates existing records)

**For analysis:**
- Use `vendor_name_key` to group same companies
- Check `fpds_suspicious_contracts` for review

---

## 📈 Quality Monitoring

### Check Overall Quality

```sql
SELECT * FROM fpds_data_quality_summary;
```

Returns:
- Total contracts
- High/Medium/Low quality counts
- Suspicious count
- Average quality score
- Contract size distribution

### Find High-Quality Contracts

```sql
SELECT * FROM fpds_high_quality_contracts
WHERE contracting_agency_id = 'DOD'
LIMIT 100;
```

### Review Suspicious Contracts

```sql
SELECT * FROM fpds_suspicious_contracts
LIMIT 50;
```

### Check Quality By Agency

```sql
SELECT 
  contracting_agency_name,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  AVG(data_quality_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE data_quality_score >= 80) as high_quality
FROM fpds_contracts
GROUP BY contracting_agency_name
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

## 🛡️ What This Prevents

### Real Examples of Messy Data

**Before Cleaning:**
```json
{
  "vendor_name": "I.B.M.   CORPORATION",
  "amount": -500000,
  "date_signed": "0001-01-01",
  "naics_code": "54171A",
  "vendor_state": "california"
}
```

**After Cleaning:**
```json
{
  "vendor_name": "IBM CORPORATION",
  "vendor_name_key": "IBM",
  "amount": null,  // Invalid negative removed
  "date_signed": null,  // Invalid date removed
  "naics_code": "54171",  // Cleaned
  "vendor_state": "CA",  // Standardized
  "data_quality_score": 65,
  "data_quality_warnings": ["Invalid amount", "Invalid date"],
  "is_suspicious": false
}
```

---

## ✅ What This Enables

### 1. Accurate Company Matching

```sql
-- Find ALL contracts for IBM (regardless of name variation)
SELECT * FROM fpds_contracts
WHERE vendor_name_key = 'IBM';
```

### 2. Reliable Amount Analysis

```sql
-- Get contracts by size
SELECT amount_category, COUNT(*), SUM(current_total_value_of_award)
FROM fpds_contracts
GROUP BY amount_category;
```

### 3. Quality-Filtered Queries

```sql
-- Only use high-quality data for research
SELECT * FROM fpds_high_quality_contracts
WHERE is_research = true;
```

### 4. Smart Deduplication

```sql
-- Find companies with most contracts
SELECT 
  vendor_name_key,
  COUNT(*) as contract_count,
  SUM(current_total_value_of_award) as total_value
FROM fpds_contracts
WHERE data_quality_score >= 80
GROUP BY vendor_name_key
ORDER BY contract_count DESC;
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Quality

```sql
-- Check quality distribution before analysis
SELECT * FROM fpds_data_quality_summary;
```

### 2. Filter By Quality

```sql
-- Use high-quality view for critical analysis
SELECT * FROM fpds_high_quality_contracts;

-- Use all contracts for volume analysis
SELECT * FROM fpds_contracts;
```

### 3. Review Suspicious Records

```sql
-- Periodically check suspicious contracts
SELECT * FROM fpds_suspicious_contracts
ORDER BY current_total_value_of_award DESC;
```

### 4. Use vendor_name_key for Matching

```sql
-- WRONG: Won't catch name variations
WHERE vendor_name = 'IBM Corporation'

-- RIGHT: Catches all variations
WHERE vendor_name_key = 'IBM'
```

## 🚀 Impact on Scraping

### During Scrape

You'll see quality stats:

```
[FPDS Full] Cleaning and validating 100 contracts...
[FPDS Full] Data Quality: 82.5/100 avg score
[FPDS Full]   High Quality: 75, Medium: 20, Low: 5
[FPDS Full]   ⚠️  Suspicious: 2
```

### After Scrape

Check the results:

```sql
-- Quick quality check
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  AVG(data_quality_score) as avg_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_suspicious = true) as suspicious
FROM fpds_contracts;
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Quality Improves Over Time

Newer contracts (2023-2024) typically have better data than older ones (2010-2015).

### 2. Some Agencies Are Better

DOD and NASA tend to have higher quality data than smaller agencies.

### 3. Larger Contracts = Better Data

Contracts > $1M usually have more complete data.

### 4. Use Quality Scores Wisely

- **Research/Analysis:** Use high-quality only (score >= 80)
- **Discovery/Volume:** Use all contracts
- **Specific Companies:** Check medium quality too (might have name but missing NAICS)

## 📖 Technical Details

### Cleaning Pipeline

1. **Fetch** raw data from API
2. **Normalize** to our schema
3. **Clean** each field individually
4. **Validate** overall record
5. **Score** data quality
6. **Flag** suspicious records
7. **Insert** with quality metadata

### Performance

Cleaning adds **~10ms per contract** (negligible compared to API fetch time).

### Storage

Quality metadata adds **~500 bytes per contract** (worth it for data integrity).
