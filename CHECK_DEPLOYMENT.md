# Deployment Check

The API returned 405 Method Not Allowed, which means the route wasn't found.

## Possible Issues:

1. **Routes not deployed** - The new API files might not have been included in the build
2. **Build failed partially** - Check Vercel logs for the latest deployment
3. **Route path mismatch** - The route structure might be wrong

## Next Steps:

### 1. Check Vercel Deployment Logs
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Click on your project (psai-website)
- Look at the latest deployment
- Check "Build Logs" for any errors related to:
  - `src/app/api/dsip/generate-instructions/`
  - Any TypeScript errors
  - Any missing files

### 2. Verify Files Were Deployed
Check if these files are in the deployment:
- `src/app/api/dsip/generate-instructions/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/dsip/generate-instructions/[opportunityId]/route.ts`

### 3. Test Alternative Domain
Try the Vercel domain directly:
```bash
curl -v https://psai-website.vercel.app/api/dsip/generate-instructions/29
```

Sometimes custom domains take longer to update.
