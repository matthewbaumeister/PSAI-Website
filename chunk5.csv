Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been the dominant solution for the portable energy needs of myriad military and commercial applications. The performance of LIBs in terms of high energy and power density is unparalleled. The development of alternative chemistries has not advanced to any significant degree. Notwithstanding the performance advantage LIBs hold over competing technologies, significant improvements to battery footprint, energy and power density, and cost can be achieved through technical improvements to electrodes that impart higher rate capability, higher charge capacity, and, in the case of cathodes, sufficiently high voltage. In this regard, new advances in materials need to be leveraged to usher in the next generation of the LIBs.

Design of porosity will be directed by accessibility of solvated ions in the electrolyte without compromising the tap density of electrodes. LIBs with prototype hierarchical electrodes will be fabricated and evaluated to verify the design approach and identify the optimization parameters and methods for practical implementation in Phase II.","Further optimization of the physico-electro-chemical, thermodynamic, and kinetic models will be done and hierarchical designs including the separators and collectors will be identified for improved structural, electrochemical, cycling, and environmental stability. Material compatibility, structure-electrochemical property relations, and novel preparation steps for scalability will be the considerations for maximizing the electrochemical performance. In situ characterization techniques (e.g., in-situ X-ray and Microscopy methods) will be explored to observe the structural changes of the hierarchical electrode materials in the presence of the electrolyte. The design of the separators will entail enhancing the safety of LIBs. The desirable porosity in the current collectors will enhance the interface conductivity. Also, scalable methods to construct electrodes will be considered for these hierarchical structured materials (including 3D printing). Phase II will culminate with prototype demonstrations that will showcase the improved next generation LIBs.","Phase III will entail further research and refinement of the designs of Phase II along with modeling and simulation towards advancing the building blocks of the hierarchical design of the components of the LIBs.

The systems objective is to significantly extend the run-time and high-pulsed power of reserve power systems for gun-fired munitions and extend the stand-off range, thus improving safety for soldiers.","Munitions can be hand emplaced or gun-launched. Munitions are stored in different environments for several years, including at very low temperatures. In all situations, munition components need to be fully operational at temperatures below -30 deg. C and sometimes as low as -55 deg. C. Proper operation of munition components and in particular munition reserve power system are absolutely critical to the mission at such low temperatures. As an example, when munitions are launched at very low temperatures or are emplaced and must be operational at such low temperatures, methods to heat their components quickly to allow their activation and to make them fully operational becomes critical. For such applications, exothermic materials are ideal candidates as heating source due to their high heat generating capacity and very fast response even at temperatures as low as -55 deg. C. It is desirable that such onboard heating devices require minimal and preferably no additional munitions volume. This topic seeks proposals for the development of exothermic-based composite structures that minimize or eliminate the need for additional volume in munitions and provide the means of heating various components of munitions such as its power source at low temperatures for their proper and optimal performance. For example, by assembling the reserve power system of hand emplaced munitions systems in such composite structures, it becomes possible to activate the munitions at very low temperatures and provide the required high-power pulses during individual missions. Similar activation at low temperatures and high-power pulses can be provided to gun-fired munitions, rockets and missiles at very low temperatures. The development of exothermic-based composite structures must be such that it supports miniaturization of munitions electronics and munitions power sources and must provide the capability to provide managed and controlled heat rates, possibly turning into insulation materials following the delivery of heat and must be capable of being designed to conform to the available geometries as load-bearing structures.

Multiple recent epidemiology studies have documented elevated risks of several cancers in firefighters. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified occupational exposure as a firefighter as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). In the largest mortality study to date, with data on 30,000 firefighters, Daniels et. al. (2015) found increased mortality and incidence risks for all cancers, mesothelioma, and cancers of the esophagus, intestine, lung, kidney and oral cavity, as well as an elevated risk for prostate and bladder cancer among younger firefighters. In a follow-on study, Daniels et. al. found a dose response relationship between fire-runs and leukemia mortality and fire-hours and lung cancer mortality and incidence. Chemical exposures encountered during firefighting are thought to contribute to the elevated risk of these cancers. The role of chemical contamination of firefighting turnout gear and subsequent repeated skin exposure to those chemical contaminants on the protective equipment has only recently been examined. Methods and technologies are needed to remove what has been shown to be harmful carcinogenic chemical contaminants on firefighter protective gear, including clothing, helmets and boots, to minimize firefighters’ repeated exposure to these dangerous fire-generated chemicals. A recent study of Ottawa firefighters (Keir et al. 2017) documented a 2.9- to 5.3-fold increase in urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites post fire events. Another study (Fent et al. 2017) determined the levels of PAHs, including known or suspected human carcinogens, on firefighter turnout gear following controlled residential fire responses. In a separate study (Huston 2014) a risk assessment was conducted on the trace metals found on firefighter PPE by estimating the potential for dermal exposure. Based on the analysis of 34 metals, lead and antimony were found to pose a potential risk. This exposure hazard affects a large number of people. In 2014, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) estimated that there were around 1,134,000 firefighters serving in 27,198 departments nationwide (31% career firefighters. 69% volunteers). Cleaning methods are defined by NFPA 1851, “Standard on Selection, Care, and Maintenance of Protective Ensembles for Structural Fire Fighting and Proximity Fire Fighting”, which is currently being revised.",367,2573,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate a product and identify test procedures to remove hazardous materials from the personal equipment of military firefighters. The methods should be effective on clothing, helmets and boots. The new protocol must be compatible with NFPA 1851. It may involve procedures to treat the equipment in the field immediately after use, procedures for thorough cleaning in a facility, including laundering, or a combination of steps. It must be practical to apply in areas with limited resources. All of the materials involved must be documented as safe for use by personnel and environmentally friendly. Work in Phase I should document the performance of the proposed procedures, and also evaluate the transportability, storage stability and cost of the cleaning materials.","Carry out additional development and testing to define an optimized system. Phase II should involve collecting data in realistic conditions. Ideally it will involve collaboration with a firefighting organization. It may be desirable to sample firefighters’ equipment before and after exposure to a training fire or an emergency response. If necessary, the performer will obtain informed consent from the individuals involved. Phase II should conclude with a clear demonstration of best practices for adoption.",Provide military users a prototype system for field-testing.

Trapped ions excel at quantum information processing, including high fidelity state preparation [1], quantum entanglement [2] and algorithmic processing [3]. Broader use has been limited by the requirement to construct a system entirely from the ground up. The need for in-house assembly and/or cleanroom fabrication, prevents rapid start up at facilities lacking the required hardware. A SWAP-c, pre-housed trapped ion device under ultra-high vacuum requiring only application of trapping voltages and integration of laser systems avoids replication of Army resources, would be cost-effective and allow for quick start up. Developing a trapped ion system involves several challenges that researchers have taken various approaches to overcome while considering the trade-offs. Challenges include micromotion compensation across a chain of ions or achieving equidistant ion-spacing. Micromotion compensation techniques have included dedicated compensation electrodes or applying relative phase shifts on trapping fields. Attempts to achieve equidistant ion-ion spacing have included approaches such as increased electrode densities for more precise trapping potential control and trapping larger numbers of ions to reduce the edge effects on the central ions. ARL’s quantum sciences program is geared toward the Army’s Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (C3I) community. In this role, ARL is seeking to partner with a small business to demonstrate a compact trapped ion system. This demonstration must yield a complete, room-temperature, in-vacuo trapped ion package with an RF resonator for trapping. Although surface-based traps may have higher densities of control electrodes, their trapping depths are substantially lower than bulk traps and at present their optical access is limited by the need to avoid laser beam scattering from the surface. Surface traps require years of in-house custom, multi-stage design and fabrication and there are limitations on the wider accessibility of these devices to the community. In contrast, although still requiring extensive expertise, a bulk trap does not need to rely on highly complex, multi-stage fabrication and a compact, packaged, room-temperature trap with multiple electrodes can accomplish a wide array of tasks from entanglement [4] to computing [5]. Employing atomic ions with visible and near visible transitions, leverages readily available laser sources and will enhance commercialization possibilities. To meet this requirement and match existing Army resources, at least Yb+ and Ba+ loaded ovens must be incorporated into the assembly [8]. A high optical access assembly will readily allow for multiple beams and trapping of different ionic species. Demonstration of loading of either ion species may be readily inferred from ion-ion spacing to minimize overhead.",437,3089,1,No,No,No,,Outline design specifications for a suitable ion trap including trapping electrodes and in-vacuo DC noise mitigation circuitry. The vacuum housing should operate with a base pressure of 10e-12 Torr and measure less than 50 cm in no more than one linear dimension. At least two different species (barium and ytterbium) of atomic sources should be placed in the vacuum chamber and positioned for efficient isotope selective ionization. The trapping electrodes should consist of at least two rf electrodes and two static voltage electrodes each with a minimum of five individually voltage controllable segments. The ion-electrode distance should be approximately 200 µm. Minimization of micromotion in all three directions should be possible via compensation electrodes and/ or use of a bifilar resonator coil [6]. An additional electrode should be included for application of microwave or RF fields. Optical access longitudinal to the trap with transverse access in two directions at approximately 90 deg to each other should be provided. Analysis of the tradeoffs should be presented for the approach used for micromotion compensation and equidistant ion spacing. The vacuum window designs should be completed along with ex-vacuo assembly of the trapping electrodes within their housing. Complete sourcing should be identified for all parts. The trap should be designed and assembled.,"Demonstrate a research-grade operational ion trapping system validating design operation parameters with either Ba+ or Yb+ atomic ions with micromotion compensation for at least one ion. Advance the research grade system to TRL 4/5. Maintain throughput optical access via at least six 1-1/3 inch optical view ports which allows for sufficient leeway to align the beams to the center of the trap or have a fiber coupled, pre-aligned solution. Two reentrant windows, one with at least 30 mm diameter and a second with 60 mm diameter placed in the plane orthogonal to the smaller ports. An RF resonator operating at approximately 30 MHz should be part of the delivered assembly. The working distance of photonic collection or diagnostic should be approximately 20 mm with a diffraction limit of around 1 micrometer and the NA from the position of the ion should not be less than 0.6 through one reentrant window. Measure and reduce the micromotion to achieve a few V/m residual trapping potential. Trapping of single ions and a linear chain should be shown with measured heating rates via time-resolved fluorescence detection during Doppler recooling [9]. Demonstrate that the heating is a few hundred quanta per second comparable to research grade traps of the same ion-electrode distance [10].","Advance development of package to TRL 7/8. Establish and demonstrate regular and routine trapping of a linear chain of 5 to 10 ions of one atomic species, minimize micromotion across the chain to a few V/m and demonstrate typically accepted ion chain lifetimes of a few minutes observed in bulk traps [7]. Fully document operation processes of ion loading, trapping parameters electrode voltages, confinement RF amplitude and characterize ion lifetime and ion chain stability.

While the work in commercial autonomous vehicles and ranging has largely focused on the NIR waveband, alternate detection technologies require the use of MWIR and LWIR (thermal) systems. Furthermore, ranging is often achieved using relatively short gate times for detecting the returned laser pulse with high precision and the use of a voltage ramp or some other timing device to sync the detector to the active source, allowing a range to be calculated. Other applications, however, can make use of circuitry such as that for asynchronous laser pulse detection (ALPD), often use longer gate times, and require detecting multiple pulses within a single gate. This topic seeks to develop a DROIC architecture that achieves both laser ranging and at least one other capability such as ALPD and/or multi-pulse detection. The ideal ROIC would support all three capabilities within a single design. Such an architecture will have applications to Next Generation Combat Vehicles (NGCVs) under the Army Modernization Priorities. The developed DROIC architecture should function with active imaging sensors of relatively small pitch (=15 µm preferred) and be scalable to HD arrays. Use with an APD-based detector should be considered. The architecture must have low power consumption, compatible with eventual integration into an Integrated Dewar Cooler Assembly (IDCA) when combined with a thermal FPA. Designs where all capabilities are achieved in a simultaneous, snap-shot format are greatly preferred to those that require switching modes between frames or sequential readout.

For such a large network providing end-to-end connectivity to facilitate data communication is a major challenge. This challenge becomes more complex when these networks are operating in an environment of spectrum scarcity, active electronic warfare and surveillance. Providing a high performance network routing, reliable end-to-end data transport, and fair medium access is an unprecedented challenge even for the Internet for delay intolerant applications but this challenge is several orders of magnitude more complex for Army networks leading to performance and capacity problems. The cost and capacity requirements created by operations in scarce spectrum and in presence of electronic warfare require exploiting very short lived high rate communication opportunities and when they arise rather than ignoring them. None of the existing waveforms and their associated networking protocols are capable of operating on short lived connections in a spectrum scare environment nor do they have latencies in route discovery, slot allocations, end -to-end data transport, and diversity routing to support sub-millisecond range which is a requirement for mission critical applications. It is critical for the army, therefore to start researching next generation of routing, data transport, and medium access protocols that can support mission critical applications in congested and contested environments with sub-millisecond latencies. The goal will be to perform research in following areas: (a) Develop medium access control protocol that can facilitate interworking with multipath data transport, path diversity based routing, and short lived connections, in presence of electronic warfare. This problem is being studied in part and is an active area of research in intelligent transport systems as well as in vehicular ad hoc networks. One can start with browsing the research that has been part of Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC), IEEE 802.11a – Road Side Applications, and other seminal papers. The medium access protocol should have ability to reliably work in a dynamic spectrum access networking regimes among others. (b) Develop diversity routing techniques that dynamically choose among multiple paths that have been pre-discovered to transmit data in parallel simultaneously. Consider time varying link capacities, offered load, and latencies with delay guarantees. The routing techniques should incorporate new mechanisms that update paths two orders of magnitude faster than the current Internet routing algorithms while preserving network stability and connectivity. The routing mechanisms should be capable of computing multiple paths by diversity routing techniques. To significantly improve the responsiveness of path updates, innovative techniques are required to reduce their cost including link state protocols and methods to adaptively trigger link state updates based on quantitative estimates of the resulting benefit. It is desirable that the transport layer protocols detect and react to the fastest link variations on the order of tens of milliseconds, diversity routing across multiple pre-computed paths on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, path updates and applications response on the order of seconds. (c) Develop a new transport layer protocol that can operate on short lived connections in the tactical environment of the future that can react quickly and is able to transmit data reliably. Consider a variant of TCP such as Multipath TCP to start with then, examine the cost benefit analysis of a cross-layer design that can exploit information from application, routing, and medium access control layers.

There are several technologies currently deployed which have attempted to address this issue for the Warfighter. The first attempts at remediating the problem employed the development of systems which employed traditional techniques such as frequency hopping and utilization of pseudo-noise spread across a spectrum at lower powers for transmission. It has been shown that these techniques, while diminishing the RF footprint of the transmitter, do not fully address the requirements for a robust LPI communication system. Advancements in the application of massively random “noisy” RF has been demonstrated in the use of radar systems. These systems generate millions of random RF signals which appear to be undetectable to known detectors and spectrum analysis. The radar signal and subsequent return appear to simply be expected random background RF noise. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of a noisy RF system which can provide voice and data communications across several systems.

Methods of detecting and localizing chemical contamination on operational surfaces is limited to contact sampling and analysis by colorimetric or molecular analysis, forcing a time- and resource-intensive reconnaissance mission that places personnel or systems into direct contact with the hazardous materials in order to interrogate the surface. Recent advances in laser-based optical spectroscopy demonstrate the efficacy of non-contact remote methods for the sensing of chemical on surfaces. Ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy affords one demonstrable means for non-contact optical detection of hazardous materials on surfaces, but the standoff range is limited by atmospheric attenuation of the laser source. An alternative to standoff illumination and sensing of the spectral signature would be the application of remotely-piloted unmanned systems fitted with the laser and spectrometer; however, unmanned ground vehicles have limited maneuverability and would become contaminated on contact with the contaminated surface in order to map the contaminated area. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have much greater maneuverability, but a limited mission life and payload size, weight, and power (SWAP) budget. A possible compromise to minimize the SWAP of the UAS payload would be to mount a laser source on the base platform (e.g. the Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle) and mount an optical receiver/analyzer on the UAS. An integrated system that mounts a receiver on a UAS and synchronizes the flight path of the UAS to follow the laser spot on the surface would enable the detection of contaminants without necessarily contaminating the UAS platform. A standoff range from the NBCRV of 50 meters (threshold) to 100 meters (objective) with a 1-meter (threshold) to 2-meter (objective) standoff range for the UAS-mounted receiver would enable the rapid remote interrogation and geospatial mapping of contaminants on surfaces while protecting the reconnaissance platforms from contamination due to contact with the chemical hazard.",331,2288,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a feasibility study of detecting liquid contaminants on the ground using a remote, autonomous UAS-mounted receiver paired with a larger, vehicle-mounted laser illumination source.

A low-cost, precision countermeasure to these threats will be critical in increasing the survivability of the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV).

Potential solutions would identify personnel of interest and possible suspicious activities through various surveillance and security systems used in tactical base and installation security operations.,"The Army has limited capability to uncover potential threats based on Criminal/Terrorist Intent. To meet this challenge, predictive analytics is particularly useful. Predictive analytics solutions apply sophisticated statistical, data exploration, and machine-learning techniques to available information in order to help uncover hidden patterns. This gap presents a risk to personnel performing security operations at Entry Control Points and all personnel operating on a base or installation. Therefore, a need exists for Criminal/Terrorist Intent Determination at stand-off distances during Base Defense and Installation Operations.

The army has global impulse reduction technologies that are at a TRL level six, as standalone systems, however further studies into integration and the technology that empowers integration are required, to raise TRL level of the integration technology on the selected platform. Base level integration studies have been done on FMTV, but not necessarily on front echelon vehicles which would be first candidates for fielding and subsequent integration. So the need to study integration technologies and design o f a TRL level 6 Active Blast Mitigation technology on an MATV or RG33 platform is needed immediately. The ideal course of action would be to design a high fidelity model with the ABMS system, with the integration technology and run it through high fidelity Modeling and simulation, in both blast and road load shock and vibe, increasing the TRL level of the integration technology.

ABMS works by sensing a blast under a vehicle, analyzing that blast, and then reacting to that blast very quickly. Vehicles like MATVs and other Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles suffer from a capability GAP where casualties are due not to intrusion from underbody clast, but from deadly launch, flight and slam down; ABMS mitigates the accelerations the body feels during these events, effectively mitigating the forces felt from launch, flight, and slam down. Therefore Phase one will be to design develop an integration kit/technology to safely integrate a TRL 6 ABMS technology on to an MATV. Since adding more weight would decrease the overall mobility, automotive performance, and blast performance of the vehicle, thus counteracting the most important aspect of ABMS; so it is necessary that the kit is as lightweight and utilizes the most advanced lightweight materials possible.

The carbonitriding process provides a source for diffusion of nascent nitrogen into the iron lattice along with carbon diffusion, which results in a martensitic case with enhanced hardness. The process is suitable for enhancing the surface characteristics of low carbon steels, such as Pyrowear 53, and high alloy steels, such as Pyrowear 675. For carburizing and carbonitriding processes under vacuum conditions, preoxidization of the part is not required, which will increase the consistency of the process. Another benefit of the vacuum process is that the Intergranular Oxidization (IGO) can be eliminated, and post heat treatment machining of the processed surface is not required when the distortion is well controlled. Studies have shown consistent improvement of corrosion resistance by carbonitriding [1]. However, mixed results have been reported for wear and rolling contact performance [1, 2]. To expand the application of carbonitriding to aerospace gear applications, it is critical to obtain advanced bending fatigue, rolling contact fatigue, and wear resistant properties. With carbonitriding, both carbon and nitrogen distributions will affect the phase transformations during the quench hardening process, which will lead to different residual stresses, microstructure and hardness. The objective of this effort is to develop computer modeling techniques for carbonitriding and to demonstrate the modeling by optimizing the carbonitriding process for Pyrowear 675. The computer modeling shall be developed to predict material response during the carbonitriding process. The modeling results shall include carbon and nitrogen distributions, microstructure and hardness distributions, residual stresses, and distortion. The following parameters should be included in the model: 1) effect of carbon and nitrogen on martensitic phase transformation timing and retained austenite; 2) relation of carbon and nitrogen content on hardness; 3) effect of carbon and nitrogen content on transformation strains, which affects residual stress and distortion predictions; 4) residual stress predictions within a part; 5) surface hardness (within 5%), case depth and profile; and 6) distortion resulting from carbonitriding. To demonstrate the model, an optimized carbonitriding process shall be developed for Pyrowear 675 using the model.

This digital information can be used to predict the Soldier's hydration level, maintaining their readiness, cognition, and lethality.","Despite current Army practices, Soldiers continue to suffer heat injuries in training and on the battlefield. Maintaining soldier readiness is key to maintaining Solider lethality. To solve this, the Army is separately pursuing a system to monitor and predict Soldier hydration via a system of body worn sensors and physiologically validated algorithms [1] [2] [3]. A crucial part of this separate system is the capability to measure the volume of water a Soldier is consuming throughout the day. The few technologies that exist are either not well suited for field use, not accurate enough, or are too immature for integration. This system, when complete will ensure the effectiveness and lethality of Army units by keeping Soldiers in the fight. The desired technology should have two capabilities: 1) Measure and record the amount of water the user drinks on a threshold (T): hourly or objective (O): minute basis throughout the day in outdoor free-living and field environments. The technology should be flexible enough to accommodate several form factors, as Soldiers drink from several water containers, including: canteens, backpack water bladders, commercial Nalgene-type bottles and other sources such as disposable water bottles. 2) Measure the volume of water the soldier is carrying in their water containers at any given time. This data would be used in a separate system, for example, for logistical purposes to track and predict a unit’s water resupply needs using near-real time data.

Currently, munitions (projectiles, primers, propellant, and fuses) are crated, palletized, and transported to the logistics release point, where they are unloaded, uncrated, and transferred into a Field Artillery Ammunition Support Vehicle (FAASV). The FAASV then travels to a point behind the field artillery weapons system, situated far enough behind the gun line for safety, but near enough to maintain line of sight. Munitions are shuttled by hand from the FAASV to the weapons system and loaded into the gun by hand. This field artillery resupply concept is focused on the expedited delivery of these mission critical munitions. Autonomous logistic resupply systems could assist in this process in numerous areas, increasing the rate of supply to the weapons system and decreasing the number of soldiers required. To stay on the cutting edge of resupply technology the Army is interested in novel solutions in the following areas: • Autonomous logistics systems for munitions: Develop autonomous robotic systems for transport of munitions in a state of storage to accelerate timelines and reduce personnel requirements. Solutions should enable unmanned unloading of crated and palletized items of various sizes from transport vehicles, and the stocking of primer and fuse boxes, propellant canisters, and uncrated projectiles onto the FAASV or alternative system for transport to the gun line. Alternatively, this system could deliver munitions to the gun line itself. • Autonomous field vehicle resupply: Develop ground/or and air platforms for autonomous delivery of field artillery munitions from the FAASV, alternate vehicle, to the weapons system for tactical last mile resupply. Technologies must autonomously deliver a payload of sensitive items across unimproved terrain with a minimum payload capacity of 150 lbs. over distances 1km or under. • Autonomous field weapon system operation: Develop autonomous robotic systems that are capable of semi- and fully autonomous munitions handling inside a weapons system. Its functions would support loading of projectiles into the cannon breech, setting of charges and propellants, and management of excess case materials inside of the weapons system. Potential solutions should consider the need for compact form factors, low electronic signatures, cyber security protections, shock and vibration management, and power supply constraints. • Command and control in a GPS-denied environment: Develop capabilities to facilitate the movement and accurate delivery of munitions to mobile field artillery units while maintaining secure command and control and navigation in GPS degraded/denied and radio frequency contested environments. Potential solutions include but are not limited to digital datalink, computer vision, path planning over unimproved terrain in uncertain/adversarial environments using artificial intelligence, teaming/swarming behaviors, visual inertial odometry and map of the earth. All solutions should have low electronic signatures and cyber security protection. • Human augmentation: Develop passive or active exoskeleton capabilities to assist crew-served artillery systems. Desired capabilities will mitigate injury due to human manipulation of objects weighing greater than 100lbs as well as repetitive motion injury. Additional needs include solutions to mitigate the effects of exposure to high decibel acoustic transients and continuous acoustic signatures consistent with crew-served weapons system operations. Potential solutions will address harmful environmental exposure without impairing communication or sensing of the local environment, be capable of sustained operations, and not require extensive training. Solutions to this solicitation will be those that innovatively adapt current technology to produce results in a short timeframe and at low cost.

While the Army continuously scouts the technology terrain to enhance its capability portfolio, the information derived from such activities, is not sufficiently discoverable due to the manner in which it is collected, managed, and communicated. The lack of “discoverability” in turn limits opportunities for serendipity, where technology information collected for one purpose can be related to alternate needs through the unstructured interactions of an extended stakeholder group. AIN-IS should address this need based on the development of (1) a taxonomy that normalizes technology data collection and reporting and (2) a network-based knowledge environment, where users build an accretive information context for technology decision making. The potential impact of structured, network-based knowledge sharing as a catalyst for innovation is profound – allowing organizations to build Technology Domain Awareness and benefit from the technology and application discovery efforts of other members in the network. For example, such a framework should enable distributed Army stakeholders to collaterally share technology assessments in areas of mutual interest and likewise promulgate information regarding emerging capability gaps. Where technology information intersects with a capability gap, the opportunity for a new applied innovation exists. In this scenario, the ability of the networked organizations to (1) find and (2) apply mission-relevant technologies is amplified by the extent to which the participants represent common technology equities and capability needs. In order to capitalize on innovation opportunities, however, knowledge sharing services alone are not sufficient. Broadly speaking this technology should be to source problems directly from soldiers, use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to determine if solutions to the problem exist or are in development across the DOD, program should identify critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the scope of work and source potential domestic and international vendors, and academia. The program should also identify relevant contract mechanisms, existing contracts and facilitate payment to the companies. Approaches to accomplish this could include but are not limited to • Scalable application of block-chain and/or distributed ledger technologies to allow for multiple party interaction with the database and immutable recording of their transactions • Creation of a mobile-optimized engagement platform to allow for the solicitation of ideas directly from soldiers. Explore ability of AI/ML to classify and group similar proposed problems and to develop technology domain awareness capabilities to search for solutions internal and external to the DOD encompassing both industry and academia • Development of a natural language processing skillset to sort through after-action reviews, work orders, and integrated priority lists to identify potential problems not directly input by soldiers • Creation of a platform to allow expert reviewers to assess technology eliminating the need for separate technology analysis systems.

Traditional optics are radially symmetric while freeform optics can be non-radially symmetric. The increased flexibility of freeform optics allow for potentially revolutionary optical designs. Previously freeform optics were not really practical due to manufacturing limitations. Additive manufacturing technologies such as three dimensional printing are making an entire new generation of optical components and designs possible. For example, an Alvarez lens system is capable of providing a continuously variable focal length with a compact size. A Freeform optical element that is able to precisely focus light at different wavelengths will reduce the number of optical components required in a weapon mounted fire control sighting system, greatly reducing the size and weight of the system.

Currently, there are many fielded Army vehicle parts that are made of aluminum or other metals that could potentially be replaced by lighter and stronger fiber composite materials. The anisotropic nature of the fiber reinforcements often requires the fibers to be highly aligned to obtain advantageous material properties. However, this imposes restrictions on the part geometries due to the need to preserve the continuity of long or continuous fibers. Strong curvatures or sharp angles would cause the fiber reinforcement to break, compromising mechanical properties. A method of addressing this problem is to produce prepregs of highly aligned (>90% of fibers within 5º of the same orientation), short (45%). This strategy has two advantages: (1) theoretical models [1, 2] have shown that high alignment with high aspect ratios (approaching 1000) should produce materials that have material properties that approach those of their continuous counterparts and (2) the short fiber material should be readily formable (e.g., it could be stamp formed or compression molded in a manner similar to that of aluminum) due to its discontinuous nature. Despite the central importance of formability while maintaining properties, there is currently no commercially available method for achieving the high precision short fiber alignment mentioned above. There are at least two reasons for this. The first reason is the difficulty in creating a uniform dispersion of short fiber reinforcement in a resin or other fluid media (e.g., air, water) used for alignment. It is extremely difficult to prevent clumping or agglomeration among the short fibers in highly loaded resins due to the electrostatic interactions and dispersion forces that attract fibers to each other, and surface energy mismatches between the reinforcement and the dispersion media that prevent full wetting of the fibers. In addition to compromising the alignment necessary to attain the desired material properties, fiber agglomerates and clumps can impair filling of the resin, creating processing defects in the composite parts. A second reason is the challenge associated with uniformly aligning well dispersed short fibers in a consistent and reproducible manner. Some alignment techniques have shown promise, but they have suffered from the following drawbacks: (i) low fiber volume fractions, (ii) insufficient alignment, or (iii) long overall fiber lengths, which prevented them from achieving materials with properties that approach those of similar continuous materials with better formability. Some of these challenges are themselves associated with the dispersion problems mentioned above. Recently, it was demonstrated that specific patterns or alignments of particles in a fluid can be created through the use of arranged ultrasonic transducers [3, 4]. This was accomplished by developing a sufficient mathematical understanding of the forces generated from ultrasonic interactions that the resulting particle patterns could be predicted. Other researchers have had success in employing electromagnetic fields to accomplish similar controlled alignments (5). Given that it has been established that it is possible to create dispersed and organized patterns using external fields, it should be possible to develop a methodology of creating well-dispersed and highly aligned composites via chemical, acoustic, electromagnetic, or mechanical methods. A method of consistently creating uniform well dispersed and oriented short fiber reinforcement in highly loaded composite materials would not only enable the development of more flexible and inexpensive composite fabrication",562,3848,1,No,No,No,,"The offeror(s) shall develop a technique to (1) consistently disperse a short fiber (80% of fibers within 15º of the same direction) in a highly loaded (>30 vol% fiber) thermoplastic or thermosetting matrix (e.g., Nylon 6 or an epoxy resin). Offeror(s) should take care to address or counter the electrostatic interactions between fibers and surface tensions that promote agglomeration. Potential solutions for obtaining good dispersion include, but are not limited to, chemical modification of the fiber and matrix, ultrasonic dispersion, or utilization of EM interactions for dispersion. Potential solutions for alignment include, but are not limited to, fluid flow, (di)electrophoresis, and pneumatic techniques. The goal of phase I is to demonstrate an ability to consistently produce a 30vol% or higher fiber loaded composite sheet with a uniform alignment of short fiber reinforcement. The parts produced by said method should be a minimum of 0.5 mm thick and of sufficient lateral dimensions for a simple tensile test in the fiber direction. Adequate dispersion and alignment of the fibers should be confirmed via microscopic or non-destructive evaluation. Samples shall be provided to Army researchers for independent testing and validation.

Traditional thermionic electron sources operate at cathode temperatures over 1000o to produce appreciable electron emission. Such high temperature have serious consequences in terms of lifetime and reliability. As an electron emitter, diamond offers several advantages over conventional electron emitters. These advantages include a wide bandgap, large breakdown field, high electron mobilities, and high thermal conductivity. Its ability to control electron affinity through surface termination and doping is also extremely important for electron emission. Negative electron affinity (NEA) has been demonstrated through hydrogen termination of the diamond surface. This has resulted in superb electron emissivity even at room temperature. Recent advances of diamond thin film growth based on techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and thermodynamic growth under high-pressure high-temperature have resulted in commercially available large-size, single-crystal, and high-purity synthetic diamond substrates. Furthermore, post growth processing techniques such as surface polishing and atomic layer etching have also significantly reduced surface roughness of these diamond films. All of these new developments now open the door for realizing practical diamond-based applications including efficient and low temperature field-emission electron sources. In a diamond electron amplifier (DEA), electrons are generated as secondary emission from a hydrogen terminated surface of a diamond film after excitation by a primary electron beam. It has demonstrated the ability to amplify an electron beam current by several orders of magnitude while at the same time yielding high current and high electron beam quality with ultralow emittance and energy spread while maintaining relative low cathode temperatures. All of these are desirable characteristics for the aforementioned applications. However, key scientific and technical challenges still need to be addressed for DEAs to realize their full potential. Issues such as hydrogen desorption under high current and elevated temperature and DC shielding by surface charge build-up due to surface dangling bonds and impurities have been observed and resulted in reduced electron emission efficiency. The origin of these surface degradation processes need to be investigated and eventually compensated in order to recover the reduced emission efficiency. New surface processing techniques for surface termination with molecules other than hydrogen and incorporating dopants into diamond can also be investigated and developed to achieve higher NEA and further improve electron emission efficiency. The goal of this topic is to investigate electron emission process from diamond, develop new surface processing techniques for diamond to improve electron emission efficiency, and create DEA prototypes which incorporate these new techniques to achieve high current, high brightness and long lifetime operation.",454,3348,1,No,No,No,,"During the Phase I effort, a numerical model and design methodology for diamond electron amplifiers (DEAs) will be developed.

Such transmitters and receivers could produce high power beams from very compact packages. Speeds of multi-Gbps data rates should clearly be achievable with potential to go even faster than bipolar lasers thru use of unipolar QCLs due to faster carrier transport of purely electron based devices. However, few advances have occurred to push such approaches beyond the initial investigation phase [1]. More recent advances in reliable, Watt-level output power QCLs show the readiness for further pursuit of free-space laser communications based upon these devices [2]. Other lasers based on antimonide semiconductors have also progressed to Watt-level output powers needed for significant link distances [3]. Mid-infrared photodetectors have also advanced in various materials showing promise to be developed into high-speed receivers for sensitive, low bit-error-rate (BER) performance [4, 5].

Software objectives include extending CAD models to IGA models for high-fidelity computation on supercomputers, doing the required mesh generation automatically or without substantial user effort, and developing a good graphical user interface for conducting simulations and post-processing of results. IGA [1], because of its special higher-order nature, has several very desirable features in multiscale computation of flow and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, including superior spatial and temporal accuracy in the flow solution and more accurate, sometimes exact, representation of the solid surfaces, in-cluding and especially those coming from CAD models. This plays a crucial role in many classes of problems. Compared to classical methods such as the finite differences and finite elements, it performs well even in computations with high-aspect-ratio elements; such elements are inevitable in real-world flow and FSI problems where accurate representation of boundary layers requires very small/thin elements near complex solid surfaces in internal flows and FSI prob-lems where contact between solid surfaces requires meshes in very narrow spaces. Also, for the same level of accuracy, it generally requires fewer un-knowns than classical methods, and so it has larger effective element sizes and therefore the computations can be done accurately with larger time-step sizes, resulting in substantial savings in computing time. Because it shifts the compu-tational burden from the number of unknowns to the number of floating-point operations per unknown, and because it does that without creating any compu-tational disadvantages, it is very suitable for efficient parallel computing. This makes IGA attractive in real-world flow and FSI analysis and is the reason this solicitation seeks to implement it in important mobility applications. IGA-based computation has been applied to FSI problems in turbomachinery [2], tire aerodynamics [3], ship hydrodynamics [4], and gas turbines [5-7]. However, mesh generation with IGA, such as in Nonuniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) mesh generation, is not as established and straightforward as mesh generation in the classical methods such as the finite differences and finite elements. To make IGA-based flow and FSI computations even more powerful and practical, this solicitation seeks implementations that make the mesh generation more straightforward and automated, similar to current finite difference and finite ele-ment methods. It seeks easier adaptivity of solutions, such as creating thin lay-ers of elements near solid surfaces to accurately represent the boundary layers with less user effort. It seeks more user-friendly and dynamic mesh motion that matches the structure motion and deformation in an FSI computation, automati-cally maintaining the thin layers of elements created near solid surfaces. Basically, extending the CAD models to IGA models in terms of mesh generation, solution adaptivity and FSI mesh motion has to be more automated, embedded in a good graphical user interface (GUI). The product will enable IGA-based computation to play an expanded and significant role in enabling mobility design in military and commercial applications.",503,3548,1,No,No,No,,"a) Identify the most promising path(s) forward from existing methods and implementations of NURBS mesh generation in real-word mobility applications of interest, such as turbocharger turbines with exhaust manifolds, parachutes, and rotor-stator interactions in adaptive axial-flow or centrifugal turbomachinery with pitching blades/stator vanes. Identify typical applications and regimes of interest, and identify relevant geometries and parameters suitable to demonstrate the feasibility of IGA-enabled solutions. b) Develop and demonstrate the generation of a NURBS mesh made of patches, demonstrate recovery of the original model surfaces, and demonstrate the suitability of the recovered surface for accurate and robust fluid mechanical computations. c) Develop GUI implementation of the method. The focus will be on NURBS meshes. In problems with complex geometries, it may be necessary to use multiple NURBS patches; making that more user-friendly should be one of the GUI features. There should be two options for handling the joints be-tween patches: C0-continuity, or C-1-continuity (probably with discontinuous functions). d) Automate the mesh motion matching the structure motion and deformation in an FSI computation. The motion of the solid surfaces can be represented by using time-dependent NURBS basis functions as one of the possible feature choices in the GUI implementation. e) Implement the foregoing scheme numerically and conduct appropriate proof-of-concept computations.","a) Expand the computational technique to basis functions other than NURBS, such as T-splines or others.

The computational method shall be verified and validated by conducting required fluid flow experiments using a pitching annular turbomachinery cascade with articulating stator and rotor blade configuration. f) The computational technique will be tested, validated, and implemented as a documented software package that can be shared or marketed. g) Transition the developed methods and software, including documentation, to interested users in academia (e.g. CFD and Mobility Design research groups in the US and Europe), industry, and government (e.g. ARL-VTD, TARDEC) under appropriate licensing agreements.

This will in turn enable rapid, high quality solutions in a variety of complex engineering applications, especially those involving high velocity/high pressure flows over deforming elements, such as found in turbines, in highly deformable elements such as MAV rotors, and others.

However, the technological potential of this interesting new class of materials has not advanced sufficiently for technology realization. The goal of this topic is to address the traditionally weak link between knowledge generation and applied research/engineering to accelerate the pace of new technology development. Among the known TIs, high quality Bi2Se3 in combination with ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials forming a planar heterojunction is expected to provide a unique opportunity to develop energy efficient electronics ranging from low power switching and memory to energy harvesting. A TI channels electrical current through 100% spin polarized surface states ensuring a very highly efficient exchange interaction with adjacent magnetic materials. The resulting spin orbit torque transfer [1] enables magnetic order in an FM or AFM to be switched at much lower energies than can be achieved with conventional heavy metals. Proposed TI-based energy efficient electronics have, however, been hampered because standard approaches to epitaxy of magnetic materials such as molecular beam epitaxy and pulsed laser deposition require sample temperatures above what TIs can survive. Deposition of the TI on the magnetic material is also ill suited for device and circuit patterning and does not surmount the challenge. Because of the excitement and nascent nature of the field of topological materials, alternative methods for building heterostructures with other materials, ranging from mechanical approaches to low temperature chemical techniques have not yet been considered. Such techniques have been established in other electronic materials but have not been applied in the context of topological plus magnetic materials. This STTR topic therefore seeks an innovative technique/approach/methodology for the deposition of known insulating FM or AFM materials on topological materials such as Bi2Se3 (other well investigated TI materials with spin polarized topologically protected electronic surface states are also of interest) at low temperature (e.g. below 300°C) so that the integrity of the underlying TI material is maintained by its own chemical and physical stability. Key aspects to form the heterostructure are (i) the control of the formation of the terminating top atomic layer on the surface of TI materials, (ii) the formation of the first atomic layers of the deposited magnetic material on the TI material, and (iii) sustaining the magnetic order of the magnetic material. Layer by layer deposition preserving the underlying TI quality is highly desired under a set of available parameters such as temperature, pressure, deposited thickness and speed. The created interface/heterostructure, as demonstrated in Ref [1-2], is expected to be characterized by advanced measurement and analysis to determine the interface structure and the electronic and magnetic interactions between the two different materials. Understanding the relationship of the interface characteristics as well as the nature and extent of the electronic/magnetic interactions is expected for iterated tunings and optimizations. Alternative techniques to create structurally well-defined and atomically regular interfaces between magnetic materials (as an over-layer) and high quality TI materials (as a substrate) will be considered.",504,3519,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate low temperature deposition or alternative method for interfacing magnetic materials on dichalcogenide topological insulators.

They face severe cognitive and physical loads while in combat and while preparing for combat. The Army prepares soldiers with both physical and cognitive training. Individual soldiers usually also prepare themselves for training and combat by consuming considerable quantities of nutritional supplements, including vitamins and minerals. Standards for vitamins and minerals were developed in the 1940s and have changed little since then. National recommendations vary widely across the developed world, reflecting the paucity of underlying science. Most importantly, national standards were developed to reflect the needs of an average individual and take no account of genetic variation that dramatically influences needs at an individual level. Furthermore, indiscriminate overconsumption to attempt to compensate for this lack of knowledge leads to both health and performance problems. Advances in DNA sequencing technology have revealed a surprising level of genetic variation between individual humans, with any two humans differing by an average of 3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms. While some polymorphisms are neutral, many others have a metabolic and physiological impact. Over 600 human genes encode critical enzymes that require a vitamin or mineral cofactor. Proper function of these 600 enzymes requires appropriate levels of individual vitamin or mineral cofactors; too much or too little leads to loss of function and downstream metabolic, physiological, and phenotypic effects. Single nucleotide polymorphisms within the exons, promoters and splice sites of these genes alter the amount of the vitamin or mineral cofactor that an individual needs. A typical human has functional polymorphisms in two or more of these critical 600 genes, that alter the amount of cofactor needed for proper enzymatic function. Because of advances in sequencing technologies these polymorphisms can now be rapidly identified and biochemically interrogated. The results of these interrogations of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms can be used to tailor intake of supplements to individual genotypes. The impact of this on the Future Army will be enhanced warfighter cognitive and physical performance. With the advent of inexpensive genome and exome sequencing it is becoming unconscionable to not exploit this new capability. The missing link between individual genomic information and improved performance capabilities is the functional interrogation of single nucleotide polymorphisms in key enzymes that require vitamin or mineral cofactors for proper function. The objective of this SBIR is to functionally interrogate single nucleotide polymorphisms in a subset of the 600 genes that encode critical enzymes that require a vitamin or mineral cofactor in order to identify those variants that affect enzymatic function but that can be remediated with vitamin or mineral supplementation in order to enable enhanced cognitive and physical performance and to protect warfighters from performance-degrading factors. Metabolic tuning through dietary cofactors (i.e. vitamins and minerals) is safe, efficacious, inexpensive, and easy to deliver.",462,3233,1,No,No,No,,"In phase I the investigators will demonstrate that they have the capability to rapidly, efficiently and rigorously screen comprehensive libraries of human polymorphisms in metabolically important genes whose enzymatic activity is cofactor sensitive. They will demonstrate this by determining, for one common human polymorphism, the impact of the polymorphism and the impact of individually tailored nutritional intervention. Furthermore they will quantify the impact of the polymorphism and the intervention on performance in a young healthy population that is similar demographically to U.S. soldiers. For example, recent work by Manousaki et al (AJHG 2017) confirms other reports that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human CYPR2R1 gene have large effects on 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, and individuals with just one synonymous coding variant have a significantly increased risk of vitamin D insufficiency (p = 1.26 x 10-12). Other investigators have previously shown that vitamin D deficiency depresses the immune response to infections, and is also associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and some cancers. While cancer, diabetes and stroke are outside the scope of this SBIR topic, 5% of male and 20% of female soldiers develop stress fractures during basic training. A successful phase I could be screening soldiers entering basic training for CYPR2R1 polymorphisms that affect vitamin D levels, prescribing dietary (vitamin) interventions for soldiers with CYPR2R1 polymorphisms that suppress serum vitamin D levels, and documenting the return on investment of this intervention on the incidence of stress fractures in basic training. However, a successful phase I could also instead focus on a different gene and its polymorphisms and quantify the effect of those polymorphisms and tailored interventions on soldier performance and readiness.

They will characterize the impact of these polymorphisms as well as the impact of remediation. They will provide DoD with qualitative and quantitative measures of the biological, physiological, and economic costs and benefits of assaying these polymorphisms in warfighters. The deliverable is the dataset which will provide the content for immediate implementation for genotyping assays to identify individuals with suboptimal enzymatic activity. The performer will have designed a low cost accurate screening test for individual humans and low cost recommendations for individually tailored nutritional recommendations of FDA approved over the counter supplements to optimize performance capabilities. By the end of phase II the results will be ready for large scale commercial production. The analysis should cost less than $100 per soldier and the analysis should be complete within 24 hours of receiving a soldier’s sample.","The ability to use tailored regimens of over the counter FDA approved vitamins and minerals in conjunction with precise knowledge of the molecular effects of individual genetic polymorphisms will radically advance human performance capabilities. Today many warfighters seek to be physically and mentally better prepared by consuming vast quantities of vitamins, herbs, and other substances, often with no scientific basis whatsoever and almost certainly with no knowledge of their own genetic variance and biochemical needs. This SBIR will change this behavior from anecdote driven to scientifically based. It is anticipated that civilian athletes, scholars, scientists and engineers, as well as any civilian seeking improve physical or cognitive capabilities will embrace the opportunity for informed nutritional intervention in order to safely and economically enhance and preserve cognitive and physical performance capabilities.",1,"Troesch, B., Weber, P., and Mohajeri, M.H.

Naturally produced melanin absorbs energy in many different forms (UV, visible light, ionizing radiation, electromagnetic), binds toxic materials (metals, oxiding agents, free radicals) and provides structural strength. Melanins are believed to be the primary protective mechanism for microorganisms that survive in harsh environments like Chernobyl, Fukushima and Antarctica. Experimental mice injected with melanin survive otherwise lethal doses of gamma irradiation. Melanin absorbs solar radiation and could be used to improve solar panels for energy harvesting. While this material represents extraordinary properties, exploitation for military applications is impossible without scale production of the naturally biologically produced version. Synthetic melanin is estimated to be 40-60% less efficient than naturally derived melanin. Research on industrial production of natural melanin will allow for future structural studies on why synthetic melanin lacks several properties. At the industrial scale, melanotic materials (either naturally or synthetically produced) could yield revolutionary benefits in the battlespace such as inexpensively EMP shielding sensitive equipment, protecting soldiers from the harmful effects of radiation, enhanced mountain and alpine operations, new types of batteries and possibly even explosives.

Recent advances in materials science now enable the production of precisely engineered obscurants with nanometer level control over particle size and shape. Numerical modeling and many measured results on metal flakes affirm that more than order of magnitude increases over current performance levels are possible if high aspect-ratio conductive flakes/discs can be effectively disseminated as an un-agglomerated aerosol cloud. CURRENT STATUS: Aluminum has been demonstrated as a PVD produced material that has high extinction cross-section/unit mass characteristics on the order of 10 m2/gram. Despite its high extinction, aluminum PVD flakes are too pyrophoric and too low in packing density to be practical for dissemination in munitions. Previous efforts with copper PVD processes were unable to produce desired particle dimensions.

The method shall be in an easy-to-use format, not too technically demanding, and require instrumentation with minimal analytics. The method should enable the assessment of DNA methylation targeting a particular region or gene of interest as oppose to discovery of unknown epigenetic changes.","DNA methylation is the study of chromosomal patterns of DNA or histone modification by methyl groups in vertebrates. The cytosine (C) base in DNA and lysine residue in histone tails can be methylated. These modifications are considered very stable, heritable, and are correlated with locus specific transcriptional status. DNA methylation can also impact gene expression, particularly if the methylation is present in CpG islands, which are found in approximately 50% of promoters. DNA methylation alters gene expression levels primarily through regulating methylation state-dependent interactions with transcriptional activators or repressors, and chromatin remodeling enzymes. There are multiple events that can impact DNA methylation machinery. These biomarkers can be used at any stage of a disease and can be associated with its cause (risk biomarkers), onset (diagnostic biomarkers), clinical course (prognostic biomarkers), or response to treatment (predictive biomarkers). To date vast majority of DNA methylation are reported in cancer research and recently DNA methylation has been known to show a significant role in the pathophysiology of several other diseases such as PTSD (Hammamieh et al 2017), aging ( Hovarth et al 2013) as well as neurodegenerative disorders (Levenson et al 2011). There is a growing body of literature suggesting a role for epigenetic factors as a molecular link between environmental factors and type 2 diabetes. Multiple technologies exist by which these differences can be measured. Most of these methods detect the global DNA methylation or overall changes in DNA methylation status of the sample (1). Bisulphite sequencing that is considered the gold standard method for the detection and quantification of DNA methylation and is similar to genomic sequencing with regards to its prohibitive cost and difficulty in data analysis. To perform a targeted region sequencing, primers are designed that are specific for bisulphite converted DNA; It is a quick method, which could be used for simultaneously profiling of multiple samples/multiple regions (Zymo research, (5)). The obvious drawbacks of the current methods are that they are all time intensive and involve the use of multiple equipment with specialized training. Less common is the detection of methylated bases directly through sequencing of unmodified DNA that could be done without enrichment or bisulfite conversion. Considering the detailed procedure of bisulphite modifications, direct detection of modified bases would be a preferred approach. Another approach for methylated DNA fractions of the genome, usually obtained by immunoprecipitation, could be used for hybridization with microarrays ( 1, 4, 5 ). This is the most popular method which fills that gap between whole genome bisulfite sequencing and cumbersome low throughput methods that can access the methylation of a pre-designed individual CpG sites and can be customized to region of interest. Pyrosequencing is another technology where individual primers are designed to get a short-read pyrosequencing reaction of around 100 bp. The level of methylation for each CpG site within the sequenced region is estimated based on the signal intensities for incorporated dGTP and dATP. The result is quantitative, and the technique is able to detect even small differences in methylation (down to 5%). It is a good technique for heterogeneous samples but requires specialized equipment and training. Advancement in the development of nanopore-based single-molecule real-time sequencing (2-3) technology (Oxford nanopore) can help to detect modified bases directly in short time. Commercialization of each or combination of the unique technique will bring the next generation of assay with even better sensitivity and specificity that would be easy to perform and analyze. The aim of this STTR is to develop a method of choice that should deliver an unbiased answer to the biological question being asked by the researcher. It will be important to consider following factors when choosing a method for targeted DNA methylation analysis: 1) The development of an automated procedure; 2) The investigation is on known methylation sites for specific gene of interest 3) The amount of sample requirements. Considering clinical samples, whole blood would be sample of choice. 4) The sensitivity and specificity of the assay proposed; 5) The robustness and simplicity of the method. 6) The simplicity of software for analysis and interpretation of the data; 7) Effortless use of specialized equipment and reagents; 8) Turn-around time to result 9) Assay cost.",694,4615,1,No,No,No,,"Given the short duration of Phase I, this phase should not encompass any human use testing that would require formal IRB approval. Phase I should focus on system design for rapid detection of targeted methylation sites using any gene/region of interest. At the end of this phase, a working prototype of the assay (s) should be completed and some demonstration of feasibility, integration, and/or operation of the prototype. In addition, descriptions of data analysis and interpretations concept and concerns should be outlined. Phase I should also include the detailed development of Phase II testing plan.","During this phase, the integrated system should undergo testing using some targeted genes/regions of interest for evaluation of the operation and effectiveness of utilizing an integrated system and its capability to demonstrate the utility in a diseased condition such as PTSD. Accuracy, reliability, and usability should be assessed. This testing should be controlled and rigorous. Statistical power should be adequate to document initial efficacy and feasibility of the assay. This phase should also demonstrate evidence of commercial viability of the tool. Accompanying the application should be standard protocols and procedures for its use and integration into ongoing programs. These protocols should be presented in multimedia format.","The ultimate goal of this topic is to develop and demonstrate a technology enabling the direct detection of modified bases such as methylation sites. This assay format should also be seamlessly integrated so that it can be used as monitoring tools for long term health assessment. Once developed and demonstrated, the technology can be used for identification of risk, diagnostic, prognostic, monitoring and/ or predictive biomarkers for diseased state. Development of new technique for methylation analysis will open a multitude of possibilities for biomarker development and might become extremely valuable in clinical practice.",1,"Horvath S.

For the hands, Soldiers can increase protection by switching from gloves to mittens. A similar option exists for wearing boots with progressively higher levels of insulative capabilities. The trade off to higher insulation under the current system is the loss of dexterity and increased weight, both of which impact mission execution and success. Improvements in thermal extremity protection will offer a cognitive benefit to Soldier performance as well as enable better dexterity for operations—such as shooting— which combined will improve Soldier lethality in extreme operating conditions. Many athletic and sportswear companies are now selling garments with built-in heating elements, from socks and gloves to full jackets, thus allowing a wearer to maintain thermal comfort with less bulk. However, to date, the majority of these systems require the use of power. In addition to the power challenge, many systems are not Berry amendment compliant, limiting procurement options. The focus of efforts under this topic call will be on developing material systems that can store and deliver heat to a Soldier in the field without the need for a power input.

Unlike current logistic fuels, hydrogen needs to be extracted from a source before it can be used, as it is not abundantly available in a usable form naturally. Numerous methods for hydrogen generation have been investigated in the past few decades, most usually requiring external energy to produce the hydrogen and treatment to remove compounds that could damage a fuel cell if passed through. Recent advances in technology have suggested that producing hydrogen from water with direct exposure to sunlight may be an attractive path for hydrogen generation. A system is desired to produce hydrogen from water and exposure to sunlight with no external energy input, just sunlight. The system should produce hydrogen that is of sufficient purity for proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell use (99.999% pure). The hydrogen produced by the system should be ready to use in a fuel cell application or passed to a compressor/hydrogen storage system. The system should also be able use greywater or wastewater as a hydrogen source.

The system should minimize both area and weight while providing the desired flow rate of hydrogen.","The desired result of Phase II is a system that produces 1 kg of hydrogen per day assuming 6 hours of sun exposure per day. The system should be optimized for continuous operation and provide hydrogen that can be used in a PEM fuel cell system or compressed and stored for later use in such a system. A demonstration of the system will be performed in conjunction with a fuel cell system and/or a hydrogen storage apparatus. Hydrogen purity will be measured as well as overall system efficiency.

It offers an alternative to satellite communications (SATCOM) for many commercial and military applications that requires non-line-of-sight communications. Although HF radio technology is generally considered quite mature, recent new advancements in RF/MW (radio-frequency/microwave) technology has resulted in renewed interest and new opportunities for HF communication. HF skywave propagation through ionosphere diffraction is a challenging communication channel that exhibits both low and short terms temporal fluctuations. It is also easily susceptible to unintentional interference because of spectral congestion, and intentional and adversarial jamming. To avoid interference, a frequency agile approach can be used to search for usable frequencies. However, this would not be effective if the HF communication link is under broadband barrage jamming attack. Alternatively, recent advances in RF front-end and software defined radio technologies have suggested that HF radios can be intrinsically hardened so that they can withstanding and survive interference and jamming attacks without causing service interruption and even suffering electrical damages to the circuitries. Examples of these technologies include, gallium nitride (GaN) low-noise amplifiers (LNA) offering front-end high-linearity and high-power-handling capability; precise high-resolution and high-linearity analog-to-digital convertors offering high dynamic range and high waveform fidelity; digital-signal-processing (DSP) and mixed signal techniques employing machine learning and artificial intelligence for signal filtering with extremely low signal-to-noise ratio.

Phased-array beamforming antenna technology enables fast electronic beam steering without moving antenna apertures and is a key technology enabler for SOTM. However, phased arrays have yet to be widely deployed mainly because of high implementation cost. The last two decades have seen significant reduction in the costs associated with front-end monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) technologies.

This topic seeks to alleviate both limitations by considering alternative solutions that eliminate threats through the disruption of a target's electronic control systems rather than destroying the target by directing enormous amounts of power onto it as quickly as possible. For example, the coupling between electromagnetic radiation and electrons in solids suggests that short, high-intensity laser pulses rather than high-energy continuous wave lasers or microwaves may provide this alternative solution. Even without reaching the electronics directly, the interaction between a laser pulse and a material can generate broadband radiation that may disrupt nearby electronics. Other potential solutions involving directed energy will also be considered. Any DE system able to remotely disrupt naturally packaged electronics in a realistic target in less than a few milliseconds is of interest, especially if the solution may be scaled to neutralize targets more than 1 km away.",210,1414,1,No,No,No,,"The offeror will experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of remotely disrupting or disabling electronics representative of those found in military targets. By ""disruption"", it is meant that the device electronics are temporarily disrupted or permanently disabled so that the target cannot perform its mission. Theoretical studies and/or modeling to explain the phenomenon employed and/or engineer system design characteristics as appropriate to the proposed solution should also be included. The deliverable for Phase I will be the design of the system that will be constructed and tested in Phase II.","The offeror will construct and deliver a system that can apply short-pulse directed energy on a remote target such that the target's electronics are disrupted or permanently disabled. No specific target is necessary for a proposal to be of interest but it must be demonstrated that the technique can be applied to targets of military relevance. A system with a capability of disrupting or disabling military targets beyond 1 km is desired. The offeror should also demonstrate - through theory, modeling or experiment – the extent to which the system may disrupt or disable targets greater than 1 km away. The system should draw less than 1 kW average power when successfully disrupting or disabling electronics from up to 1 km. Beam divergence must be specified so that the trade space of targeting accuracy versus range can be evaluated as part of the deliverable.",The DE system must be outfitted with the ability to acquire and track targets. It must be ruggedized and made mobile. Field tests are to be conducted with various kinds of realistic targets representative of those found in military targets.,1,"Wille, H., M. Rodriguez, J.

In addition, very fast A/D converters are significant power consumers. Thus, UWB systems may be required to gain advantages of spread spectrum systems, while at the same time minimizing multi-user access interference and ameliorating the multipath problem. Mobile network protocols that are self-configuring and robust are called for in a variety of commercial situations, and represent a significant hurdle for current commercial wireless systems. E-911 requirements are being written into commercial wireless phone standards; however, conventional designs are likely to fail in challenging scenarios, such as indoors, severe urban canyon environments etc. Therefore, successful new methodologies for UWB radio networks will have significant commercial potential for high bandwidth multi-user systems as well as for precise positioning.

Demonstrate the software’s efficacy by modeling several specific data acquisition systems and verifying each of their error budgets. DUAL USE COMMERCIALIZATION: This tool will provide direct support to Common Interoperable Tools for Modeling and Simulation Validation, a DoD standard. Model updating based upon test data throughout flight test programs is critical to successfully reducing test programs by as much as 50%. Data Acquisition Error Budget Analysis Tools will provide critical information regarding the accuracy of test data used to update the models thus increasing model accuracy and eliminating costly iterations and prolong flight-testing. These tools will make major contributions toward successfully reducing flight test requirements for JSF and future Air Force and Navy flight test programs. All ongoing DoD flight test programs will reap the benefits of this new capability. The need to replicate suspect data points during flight tests will be greatly diminished reducing time and conserving resources. Other applications involving extensive data collection from remote instrumentation devices, such as wind-tunnel testing, will also greatly benefit from these tools. Besides the testing of military hardware, hospital emergency room and long-term medical surveillance equipment, automobile testing (both commercial and racing), oil well monitoring, laboratory testing, etc will find extensive applications for these tools. The chemical/industrial processing industry, drug manufacturing, and the conventional fossil fueled and nuclear power plants rely heavily upon remote instrumentation; all with a critical need to ascertain the validity of the output of the myriad of sensors and process control instruments used.

Partnership with traditional DOD prime-contractors will be pursued towards this end. In addition, while government applications will receive the most direct and immediate benefit from a successful program, terrestrial optics also stands to benefit from the results of this program. PRIVATE SECTOR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: Commercial and civilian remote sensing applications will benefit from the results of this program because of the decreased cost for space-based and ground-based telescopes. The availability of cost-effective cryogenic optics may enable commercial space-based missions. Flat mirrors that may be an off-shoot of this program may be used as cost-effective steering mirrors that reduce complexity of any optical system with pointing requirements, including ground-based telescope applications, printed circuit board photo-etching systems, automatic identification systems, scanning and dimensioning systems, environmental & gaseous emission testing systems, inspection mirrors, military & commercial aircraft mirrors, commercial and civilian remote sensing applications, and optical communications systems.",1,"S.

In order to demonstrate the potential applications of these new technologies and to show how these developments can converge to provide the war fighter with a superior tool, the Air Force is interested in integrating a JP8 SOFC with an existing 25K Loader. Although previous JP8 Solid Oxide Fuel cells have been developed, these have been focused on proof of concept and in addition have not been integrated with other advanced power technologies. Innovation will be required to produce a system that meets real world requirements and that can be used to create a complete advanced power system. The JP8 SOFC system must produce minimum vibrations and possess controls matching the load profile for an efficient power process. As this system must demonstrate the application of JP8 SOFC, it is necessary that the system is dependable as well as maintainable. Phase I: Gain knowledge and determine the applicability of a JP8 SOFC capable of charging an existing 25K hybrid loader. The reformer must be able to provide adequate power such that loader effectiveness is not compromised. The research must consider mobility, safety, and environmental issues. Models, drawings and simulations shall indicate minimum risk for continuation to Phase II. Data should be available to prove concept and validate a commercial market. Specifications for this vehicle will be available by the technical point of contact and the loader itself will be made accessible for load profile data collection.",Network Enclosure Architectural Concept Improvement,5,51,0,No,No,No,,,"Develop prototype systems to prove design performance, versatility, reliability, and improvements over the current system. A prototype demonstration will conclude Phase II. Phase III Dual Use Applications: Phase III demonstrations should include but not be limited to integration in at least one USAF 25K loader and show that the resulting combination possesses equal or better characteristics than when the loader is powered by a control source. JP8 is one of the most difficult fuels to reform into hydrogen, yet is one of the military’s most common and vital fuel. The military as well as the civilian market will be shifting to fuel cell technology in the future and this concept could help in developing more options for the fuel cell specifically in remote rural locations with barren landscapes.

Energetic materials are extremely dangerous to handle. Unfortunately the manufacturing processes used today are decades-old using antiquated equipment. This has resulted in catastrophic events leading to injury and death over the years. The design and engineering capabilities available today, along with innovative technologies that were not available decades ago, offer a unique opportunity for the implementation of safer and sustainable manufacturing processes for energetics. The main steps include the reaction, filtration, and recrystallization while extraction and distillation processes are also utilized depending on the material. These steps typically include an operator interfacing with sometimes dangerous intermediates and products. The main reaction can be done in batch or continuous reactors. Development of continuous flow synthetic approaches applied to energetic materials have demonstrated several advantages including reduced waste, material in process, process control and product quality. In order to fully realize the potential of continuous flow synthesis it needs to be paired with complementary continuous flow technologies including filtration, recrystallization, extraction, and distillation. Continuous flow recrystallization presents one of the largest challenges and opportunities in continuous flow preparation of nitramines including RDX and HMX. The pharmaceutical industry has demonstrated use of continuous flow recrystallization to result in improved purity, particle size control and particle size distribution. This topic desires continuous flow recrystallization strategies for direct recrystallization to each of the RDX/HMX class sizes (eliminating grinding steps) with tighter particle size, greater process control and improved process waste profiles while retaining the desired polymorph for each.",257,1961,1,No,No,No,,"The small business will investigate innovative strategies for lab-scale continuous flow recrystallization of RDX and HMX with tunable particle size distribution within the range specified for various class sizes and their respective desired polymorph. This lab-scale work will develop models based off of experimental work to better understand process kinetics and viability. The phase I output will be a prototype process for energetic material recrystallization that results in a tunable system for the direct production of Class 1-5 nitramines with their desired polymorph. This prototype process will result in a 20% tighter particle size distribution, eliminated operator exposure and developed strategies for inline process monitoring. While initial process development may be on surrogate compounds, the final prototype and evaluation must be on either RDX or HMX. A Phase 2 effort must be on the energetic materials.","Development and demonstration of a pilot scale process for continuous nitramine recrystallization. The process models generated in Phase 1 should be validated, optimized for affordability and robustness, and developed into a physical pilot process. This pilot scale process should produce final product at a rate of at least 1 g/min. The demonstration should exhibit polymorph and particle size control to each of the class sizes and be transition-able to manufacturing environments. It should show reduced particle size distribution, operator exposure, hazardous waste generation, and greater process control. A 20 g sample of each class size must be shipped to CCDC-Armaments Center for further evaluation of product quality. Phase 2 will conclude with a full process design and transition plan.",The process developed in Phase 2 should be scalable to production capacity. This capability will allow greater flexibility in meeting warfighter needs for nitramine-based end items in times of high demand with lower infrastructure costs than large scale batch recrystallization process equipment. It will also result in greater control of nitramine explosive properties (due to tighter control of particle size distribution) for improved end item reliability.,1,"K.A. Powell, A.N. Saleemi, C.D.

Q7 (05/29/2020): What ITAR compliance level is required by the SBA and the U.S. Army for sub-contractors working on the SBIR 20.2 Topic # A20-103?
For instance, Phoenix Analysis & Design Technologies (PADT), a rapid prototyping service provider, is ITAR compliant but not ITAR registered. Is ITAR compliant sufficient for a sub-contractor working on SBIR 20.2 Topic # A20-103 or is ITAR registered required?
A: There are no ITAR restrictions marked for this topic.

Q8 (05/29/2020): How do the SBA and the U.S. Army typically handle sub-contracted work done at a major university?
For instance, SBIR 20.2 Topic # A20-103 is a U.S. Army project so it will deal with defense technologies. As result, there is likely ITAR regulations that must be followed. But major university typically have a large number of Chinese national students working in their laboratories. Recently, President Trump suggested removing Chinese student affiliated with the Chinese military from our universities.
In addition, major universities typically have publishing requirements on work performed in their laboratories. How do the SBA and U.S. Army typically handle their publishing requirements when dealing with defense related technologies?
The SBA and U.S. Army must have addressed these issues in prior SBIRs so Iâd like to understand the standard protocols of working with major universities so that I comply with ITAR and any SBA and U.S. Army regulations.
A check list of required actions would be helpful if available.

For these individuals, please specify their country of origin, the type of visa or work permit under which they are performing and an explanation of their anticipated level of involvement on this project. Proposers frequently assume that individuals with dual citizenship or a work permit will be permitted to work on an SBIR project and do not report them. This is not necessarily the case and a proposal will be rejected if the requested information is not provided. Therefore, firms should report any and all individuals expected to be involved on this project that are considered a foreign national as defined in Section 3.5 of the BAA. You may be asked to provide additional information during negotiations in order to verify the foreign citizen&rsquo;s eligibility to participate on a SBIR contract. Supplemental information provided in response to this paragraph will be protected in accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), if applicable, and the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6)).

Q10 (05/29/2020): What foreign ownership restrictions do the SBA and the U.S. Army place on corporations participating in SBIR 20.2 Topic # A20-103?
From the SBA tutorial courses, it appears that the foreign ownership must be less than 50% in a corporation participating in SBIRs.
Is an investment from Brazilian investor an issue if it is less than 50% of the corporation?
Are there any distinctions between investors from allied countries such as Israel, UK, Japan, and Brazil and hostile countries such as North Korea, Iran, and China?
If so, what are they?
A: The Small Business Administration&nbsp;determines the eligibility of corporations to participate in the SBIR program, the Army SBIR Program does not determine the eligibility of a small business. &nbsp; Please contact the SBA regarding your question(s).&nbsp;

Q11 (05/27/2020): On the cost proposal:  It states that travel to cohort programming must come out of internal operating budgets but then suggests including costs for two cohort trips.  Should those costs be included in the budget proposal?
A: Yes (assuming that travel to a military installation will be allowed, to be determined based on status of COVID-19 situation).

Q12 (05/25/2020): Sir:

a) Topic mentions ""specific energy of 400 watts per kilogram"". Was that meant to say ""watt-hours per kilogram"" ?
b) A mention is made of a need for ""the vehicle to store several Megawatts ..."" (we assume the units are MW-hrs). Can we assume that a minimum energy sized-system for this topic would be on the order of several MW-hrs, and not smaller?

Thanks.
A: a) Yes, watt-hours per kilogram

b) In this case, no, we would not necessarily expect a MWh battery system out of this SBIR program. That&#39;s more of the framing of where we want the technology to get us.&nbsp; This is more of a cell technology development effort and we&#39;d likely be excluding many potential vendors who would not have this capability to build a pack of that size but&nbsp;might have interesting cell technology.

Basically, I'm trying to state measurable technical objectives which don't come across as being ""fluff"", so some specific numeric quantities would be helpful here.  

Also, could you give specific mandatory objectives for the Phase I option?
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">More specific quantitative measures are not available. If they were, they would have been explicitly included in the topic description. The point of the Phase I effort is to &ldquo;run the numbers&rdquo; and determine, for the selected &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; boundary layer, what the sensor specifications need to be to resolve the unsteady skin friction values.

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">The topic description states the objectives for the Phase I options. No specific mandatory objectives beyond the topic descriptions are available.

Q2 (06/14/2020): It is stated that the sensor must have ""sufficient bandwidth"" for operation in this domain.  Does this refer to sufficiently fast sensor response time in capturing rapidly changing stresses?  That is, is this a requirement for the sensor to be ""sufficiently fast""?

Q3 (06/11/2020): This appears to be a request for a proposal for sensors that detect shear stresses on rotor blades while in use, without affecting their aerodynamic performance.  This problem can be addressed without reference to the particular vehicle being propelled by the rotor assembly.  That is, it seems as though sensors that fulfill these requirements should be independent of the specific vehicle platform.  However, the Phase 1 section of the announcement states ""Perform an analysis of the required sensor performance metrics for implementation on a current full-scale vertical lift vehicle platform.""  What specific platform does the announcement refer to and why would that be relevant?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Correct. This is a request for a proposal for sensors that detect wall shear stress on rotor blades in use.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Correct. This problem can be addressed without reference to a particular vehicle, which is a particular vehicle was not specified in the topic.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Partially correct. Sensors that fulfill these requirements should, in general, be independent of the specific vehicle platform. However, in order to be minimally intrusive, there may a challenge to develop a truly &ldquo;universal&rdquo; sensor.

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Correct. The topic announcement for Phase I does ask for an analysis of what would be required for a full-scale vertical lift vehicle platform. While no specific platform is required, the relevance of the statement lies in the fact that a successful proposal must consider &ldquo;likely&rdquo; flow regimes in which such a sensor might be deployed in order to have a starting point for the analysis. The sensor solution will be dependent on the choice of vehicle platform; the flowfield for a low-speed, low-acceleration environment will obviously be substantially different than for a high-speed, high-acceleration environment. The topic author was uninterested in tying the sensor solution directly to a specific vehicle, while still desiring that proposals address realistic environments that exist on Army rotorcraft.</font></font>",,Air Platform,1,Air Platform,,,0,"wall shear stress, rotor blade, vertical lift, boundary layer physics",1,"wall shear stress, rotor blade, vertical lift, boundary layer physics",No,0,No,,Directly measure mean and fluctuating shear stress on a rotor blade.,11,Directly measure mean and fluctuating shear stress on a rotor blade.,"Aerodynamic loads on rotor blades are driven in large part by the dynamics of the boundary layer. Each point of the blade undergoes large variations in aerodynamic regimes throughout its operation; including tangential speed variations along the span, variation of both mean and fluctuating angles of attack as a result of the setting of collective and cyclic controls, as well as variation in the magnitude of the oncoming flow speed throughout the rotation in forward flight. All of these factors influence the behavior of the boundary layer and ultimately lead to the overall aerodynamic performance of a vertical lift vehicle platform. Numerical calculation of these loads from high-fidelity computation fluid dynamics models is possible, but validation of sufficiently complex models is difficult without the ability to directly measure surface pressure and shear stress at various locations on the rotor blade system. Direct point-wise sensing of these quantities would permit model validation, as well as insight into the boundary layer physics. Many boundary layer models are developed from investigations that do not include the full complexity of the actual flows (i.e. 2D vs 3D, swept wing vs rotation, Mach and Reynolds number mismatches, etc.) and thus suffer from empiricism and questionable applicability to the vehicle system. Capturing the behavior of the boundary layer subject to all the relevant physical mechanisms has potential to significantly advance fundamental understanding of the unsteady boundary layer physics, which in turn will permit more advanced vehicle/rotor system designs. Historically, hot-film anemometry and oil-film interferometry have been used as wall-shear stress measurements, but suffer from directionality, bandwidth, and the need to infer wall-shear stress behavior rather than sense it directly. A sensor capable of conducting these measurements will need to meet several challenges associated with operation in this domain: the sensor must 1) be able to be installed in rotor blades with realistic geometries, to include thin/narrow airfoils, 2) operate reliably while undergoing dynamic motion (e.g. pitch, rotation), 3) have sufficient bandwidth, dynamic range, directional sensitivity, and spatial resolution to capture relevant boundary layer physics (both mean and fluctuating quantities), and 4) provide a means for accurate readout during rotational operation of the rotor blade system.

A: <font color=""#000000"">The objective is to design and develop a low loss and high speed passive, analog, electronically tunable microwave phase shifter on tunable thin film FE material. The processing technology is not specified. However, any processing technology must be shown to be capable of producing thin films with very low loss. Loss has been a problem for FE filters and varactors. A proposal must make the case for the approach being proposed. The topic calls for 10:1 tunability within a range of -100v to +100 v. A range of -200v to +200v would not cause rejection of a proposal, but would be regarded as a weakness during the evaluation process.</font>",,Electronics,1,Electronics,Network Command,Network Command,1,"phase shifter, electronically tunable, ferroelectric, thin film",1,"phase shifter, electronically tunable, ferroelectric, thin film",No,0,No,,"Design and development of low-loss and high-speed passive, analog, electronically-tunable microwave phase-shifter based on tunable thin-film ferroelectric (FE) materials for application in military and commercial communications systems operating in the frequency range of 1 - 12 GHz.",37,"Design and development of low-loss and high-speed passive, analog, electronically-tunable microwave phase-shifter based on tunable thin-film ferroelectric (FE) materials for application in military and commercial communications systems operating in the frequency range of 1 - 12 GHz.","Electronically-scanned antenna (ESA) systems based on phased-arrays are attractive for radar and on-the-move (OTM) communication systems providing advantages such as high-scan speeds, low control power, long-term reliability, high accuracy, and adaptive beam-forming [1,2]. These traits are advantageous, especially in the increasingly congested communications environments of modern warfare, where fast-changing operational environments require increasingly adaptive communication systems. Similarly, the demand for low-cost, high-frequency phase shifters is expected to increase in the commercial market to meet the growing demand for state-of-the-art transceivers designed for 5G communication. The congestion in the frequency spectrum, the need for highly power efficient operation, and the dangers of mutual interference are driving commercial networks to the exploitation of very agile narrow beams and dynamic null steering, mainly at base stations. Commercial vehicles such as boats and aircraft will have radar applications requiring steered beams. Military communication networks will have even greater requirements to mitigate the threats of detection, jamming, and interception in addition to the dangers of friendly interference. Furthermore, mobile military networks will not depend on stationary base stations, so they will require the dynamic steering of narrow beams at each network station. Military radars will be operating in this frequency range and will also require agile beam steering. A barrier to the use of phased array antennas in these applications is the system cost of the large number of phase shifters. Passive ESAs are composed of a large number of individual antenna elements, and are capable of electronically-controlled beam-forming and beam-steering by controlling the relative phase of the signal fed to each antenna element. The key component to passive ESAs is the electronically-tunable phase-shifter that adjusts the phase-angle of the signal arriving at an individual antenna element. In order to meet performance and cost requirements, high-performance phase-shifter components are needed that are both lightweight and compact, and the total phase variation needs to be 360 degrees to control an ESA with moderate bandwidth. Electronic phase-shifters tend to incur high insertion loss requiring active amplification; however, low-loss passive phase shifters are attractive since they are lower cost and require low power. Additionally, analog phase-shifters offer accurate phase control with continuously adjustable phase-shift, in contrast to digital phase-shifters that provide a discrete set of phase states controlled by phase-bits, and thus require a lower number of control voltages reducing the control-complexity [3]. Recent advances in the growth of tunable dielectrics and control of their domains demonstrate high intrinsic material Q values greater than 1000 [4-6] while maintaining high voltage tunabilities. These advances point to significant advances in affordable system capability due to the increased performance of tunable phase-shifters with high device Q values.",436,3129,1,No,No,No,,"Ferroelectric material with intrinsic material Q’s over 1000 is within the current state-of-the-art [4-6].

Recommended transition paths are for mobile vehicular radio links via the Program Executive Office Command and Control or radars for the Program Executive Office Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors. Significantly lowering the cost of the phased array antenna will bring the capability to use phased array systems to a much wider variety of military platforms, and therefore a greater market base.

Annotation (defining regions within an image) and segmentation (labeling pixels within an image) are data prerequisites to the development of computer vison-aided Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms, Machine Learning (ML), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities. Prior to the development of algorithms associated with ATR/ML/AI, FMV with new content of interest must be meticulously annotated and segmented by a human-in-the-loop so that the algorithms “understand” the FMV content. This is an extremely expensive, labor intensive task which is recognized as the single greatest bottleneck hindering algorithm development, ML, and AI. This effort will significantly reduce the level-of-effort required to manually annotate and segment tactically relevant information in FMV. Tactical military objects offer unique, additional challenges that commercial annotation and segmentation products do not address. Commercial applications of computer vision-based autonomous systems designed for object detection are focused on autonomous vehicle technology, which emphasizes a totally different application space. For example, most tactical objects are designed to blend into the surrounding environment, void of textual content, objects of interest appear in unexpected location/positions, and dissimilar in appearance to the objects which commercial products tend to focus on (i.e. text, persons, cars). Many advances have occurred in the area of automated annotation and segmentation of FMV for the commercial industry due to requirements of self-driving automobiles. While similarities exist, annotation and segmentation for military tactical objects emphasize a different application space. Although the application space is different, the advances in state of- the-art deep learning models for optical flow computation and semantic segmentation in the commercial sector suggests a strong possibility of success in performing autonomous annotation and segmentation with sufficient accuracy (>95%) for military applications. Typical annotation by an individual varies, but statistical studies indicate an average annotation time of 35 seconds per image for a given annotator. With the use of existing semi-automated tools and various methods, an average time of approximately 7 seconds is achievable with an accuracy of no greater than 70%, which is too low for military applications. The optimal solution must be able to automatically analyze high-resolution FMV of military tactical objects and accurately produce XML metadata files that accurately annotate and segment the object’s tactically relevant “features” which are used by ATR/ML/AIs algorithms operating on similar content of interest. Annotation / segmentation must support algorithms designed to confidently and consistently report attributes such as object classification, identification, and tactically relevant “features” such as the number of wheels, dimensions, track indicators, barrel length, antenna type/configuration, armament, camouflage, and other object attributes discernable by Electro-optical and Infrared imaging sensors. The capability must output XML data products which are consumable in many system architectures. The delivered capability should offer the user options to tailor the focus system’s processing to specific attributes sought by the algorithm developer. It may be acceptable to preload the system with known attributes of the objects within the FMV file and the geospatial environment which the FMV was captured. Prioritized requirements for this capability include: 1) autonomously annotate and segment military tactical objects within FMV files, 2) extract target features from the object which enable ATR/ML/AI development, and 3) minimize the amount of time a person must invest to the pre/post process the FMV.",554,4003,1,No,No,No,,"The research effort shall explore technologies for automated image segmentation and annotation.

We realize that each test setup will vary, but a maximum projection would be helpful.
A: 30 roving units would be a good expectation for a maximum at this time. Identifying the overall maximum capability of the approach in the proposal would be good information.

Q2 (06/14/2020): We are building a system for positioning in GPS denied and degraded environments for UAV (VTOL multi-rotorcraft and fixed-wing), supporting flight from ground level to a few thousand feet AGL. We were planning to submit based on ""static, dynamic and autonomous moving platforms"". Our system covers UAV flying a few feet above the ground, and could easily integration onto a soldier or ground vehicle to prove capability in the meantime while it's submitted on a flight vehicle. Despite the answer ""Aerial vehicles are not currently used or anticipated"" - would it still make sense for us to submit? Thank you.
A: If your approach can be tailored to operate well with ground vehicles and man-portable use then it would make sense to submit.

Q3 (06/12/2020): Is it acceptable for the mobile units to transmit as part of the locating process?
A: Yes, as long as the transmissions do not interfere with military communications/systems and comply with associated FCC regulations.

Q4 (06/10/2020): 1)  The SBIR talks about a system to be used on test ranges.  Is this the only anticipated use, or is this development intended to create a solution for general deployment in larger numbers, say for combat or emergency applications?
2)  In your answer to the question submitted on 6/2, you mention that a self-contained system is preferred.  However, in other answers, you say that infrastructure should be self-contained and portable.  Would a beacon based system be acceptable?
3)  You mention that L-band will not be available.  Will there be other military frequencies, such as lower UHF (for example 406-450 MHz) that could be coordinated for this use?  Would Part 15 operation at 902-928 MHz be acceptable?
4)  Assuming a beacon based system, would the beacons be required to have their own power source, or would external power be available?
A: 1) The only intended use is for test support but if the approach could be applied to military deployment/use that would be a good benefit to mention within the proposal.

2) A beacon-based&nbsp;system would be acceptable if the range instrumentation needed (beacons) are self contained and portable.

3) Recommend not utilizing&nbsp;military-specific frequencies as they may be in use during the test events and could interfere. Frequency bands outside of military specific use should generally be acceptable as long as parameters meet regulatory requirements (FCC, etc.).

4)&nbsp;External power will not be available&nbsp;so beacons would need to have own power source.

&nbsp;

Q5 (06/10/2020): What capabilities and/or features are desired that is not being met by the Locata Network?
A: It is desired to have no permanent range instrumentation and if range instrumentation is required it should be stand-alone and portable so it could be easily&nbsp;set-up pre-test and removed post-test.

Q6 (06/09/2020): What is the expected deliverable for Phase I? For example other applications as for ""Demonstrate the feasibility of the designed approach through modeling and simulation."" Is a submittal for this Phase I a technical paper, simulations or MVP prototypes?
A: The expected deliverable for Phase I is a technical paper describing the solution approach that includes the expected performance parameters, capabilities, limitations, requirements for operation, cost, &nbsp;and other important considerations. If the solution is&nbsp;mature enough to provide a prototype for Phase I then that would be welcomed&nbsp; but not required for Phase I.

Q7 (06/05/2020): Iâm unclear from the description if the area to be tested is âin the fieldâ as in a combat area, or in a fixed location for testing. We make intelligent solar panels that you can drive on. We can built roads, parking lots, driveways, walkways, tarmacs, etc. Each panel covers 4.39 square feet and contains a microprocessor. The microprocessors can communicate wirelessly with each other and any vehicle, pedestrian, etc., that is carrying a similar device (we also make these).
 
This means that the road or parking lot can take control of an autonomous vehicle and âdriveâ it. The road or parking lot would know exactly where every vehicle, pedestrian, etc., is located and could control the vehicles accordingly. Once one of our Solar Road Panels is installed, it has a fixed altitude, longitude, and latitude. Far more accurate than GPS.
 
So back to my original question: is the testing area in the field or at a fixed location that is (or can be) paved?
A: The testing will be conducted outdoors at Army test ranges on unimproved dirt roads and trails that cannot be paved. The truth position of moving&nbsp;Army tactical vehicles and dis-mounted soldiers will be needed during testing under realistic operational conditions.

Q8 (06/03/2020): Are there any size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations or constraints on the platform which this will be installed on?
A: The system will be mounted on Army tactical vehicles (good example is a Stryker) as well as dismounted personnel (in backpack) who are on foot. The man-portable system must be manageable (size &amp; weight) for long periods (up to 4-6 hrs.) by an average adult walking on rough ground. Desired Power/battery life is 8hrs but proposal should contain what is confidently achievable based on the approach.

Q9 (06/03/2020): Can you provide any further detail on the typical duration of an operational test event?
A: The typical testing period spans 10-14 continuous days, operating 8 hours per night. Testing is conducted during nighttime hours.

Q10 (06/03/2020): Will the system be provided with an initial known positional reference prior to the start of a test/mission, or is this solution required to determine it's initial location prior to the start of test?
A: If the system needs to determine its initial position prior to the start of testing there will be an opportunity (1-2hrs) before testing starts with normal GPS coverage.

Q11 (06/03/2020): (1) Based on the question/answer with regards to a GPS pseudolite solution, what is the extent that a solution is considered to be a GPS pseudolite? Is a different waveform and/or carrier frequency using a pseudolite type of infrastructure sufficiently different?
{2} Will any position be known in a test environment, e.g. location determined prior to creating GPS denied environment?
(3) Does the use on test ranges mean that infrastructure that may not be possible in an operational environment can be used or implemented by this system?
(4) What sort of test range environments will this system to be involved with? e.g. outdoor, open, urban, in-doors, underground.
(5) Beyond denied GPS/GNSS, what other problems seem to commonly compromise the target GPS receiver tests?
A: 1) Pseudolite carrier frequency is the primary concern, cannot be in L-band (1-2GHz). Also, any range instrumentation such as pseudolites must be self-contained and portable and able to be deployed and removed with no permanent range infrastructure.

2) There can&nbsp;be opportunity allowed prior to test time for systems using GPS to operate normally for alignment, baseline, etc.

3) Any additional infrastructure must be self-contained and portable. It would be deployed pre-test and removed post-test.

4) Outdoor only. Example test ranges could be&nbsp;Fort Huachuca, AZ, Yuma Proving Ground, White Sands Missile Range.

5) in addition to denial there may be potential for deception.

Q12 (06/03/2020): 1) Are solutions required to report absolute position coordinates (i.e. lat/long), or are relative positions with respect to a reference beacon or starting position acceptable? 2) Are beacons allowed, or should the solution be self-contained (i.e. only including an apparatus to mount on the test vehicle)?
A: 1)&nbsp; Yes, report absolute position. Prefer time tagged (1Hz) 3D position &amp; velocity update saved to file. File to be harvested after test day/night

2) Self-contained is preferred.

Q13 (06/02/2020): 1) Will any other areas of RF spectrum be actively denied or jammed on the GPS-denied test range?
2) Will any other areas of RF spectrum be regularly unavailable or concurrently occupied on the GPS-denied test range?
3) Are any areas of RF spectrum explicitly available during operation of the GPS-denied test range?
A: 1) It would be good to assume&nbsp; that the entire L-band (1-2GHz) could be impacted. outside of L-band no other EW expected.

2) No, other areas are &nbsp;not expected to be impacted.

3) Not specifically.&nbsp; There is often poor coverage of commercial bands (such as cellular networks) on the test ranges.&nbsp;This largely depends on the specific locations on the ranges and that can vary widely from test-to-test.

Q14 (05/28/2020): 1) How large is the area of the test range that is typically used for these static and dynamic tests? (e.g., 10 acres, 100 acres, 1000 acres, 80k acres?)
2) What is the maximum ground speed of the various test vehicle platforms (manned and unmanned vehicles)?
3) Are aerial vehicles used now, or planned for use in the future? If so, how high above the ground surface will they fly during the test(test ceiling altitude)?
4) Do you have a cost baseline either for instrumentation cost per acre or installation/reconfiguration man-hours per instrumented acre?
A: 1) The&nbsp; average test range size is approximately 20km X&nbsp; 20km.

2) 60mph is the maximum expected ground speed.

3) Aerial vehicles are not currently used or anticipated.

4) No cost baseline has been established at this time.

Q15 (05/28/2020): If my firm submitted for an AFWERX Open Topic SBIR previously to address this capability gap in GPS-denied environments, may we still submit for this award?
A: You can submit so long as you did not receive an award for the same work. If it is the same work but you did not get an award from AFWERX, you have to state so on&nbsp;the cover sheet of your proposal.

Q16 (05/22/2020): Would a GPS pseudolite solution be acceptable or does the wording ""not reliant on the GPS signal"" preclude this solution?
A: Unfortunately, no. A GPS pseudolite-based solution would not be acceptable since operation is needed under GPS-interfered/denied conditions.",,Electronics,1,Electronics,Cybersecurity | Network Command,Cybersecurity | Network Command,2,"precision location determination, GPS denied environment, autonomous, moving platforms, testing.",1,"precision location determination, GPS denied environment, autonomous, moving platforms, testing.",No,0,No,,"Design and create a system that can provide precision location information on static, dynamic and autonomous systems under test within a GPS denied environment.",24,"Design and create a system that can provide precision location information on static, dynamic and autonomous systems under test within a GPS denied environment.","Threats to GPS signals availability has created new GPS receiver designs with are intended to operate in a GPS denied environment to provide both timing and precise location data to the user equipment or as a part of a larger system relying on these data feeds for systems functionality.

Due to their high directivity and high oscillation frequency, optical beams can transmit data over free space much faster than radio and microwave frequencies. Over the past couple of decades, there have been significant advances in optical source and receiver technology to reduce source power requirements, extend link distances, and increase link margins. Unfortunately, optical beams are much more susceptible to weather, clouds, turbulent fluctuations in the air’s refractive index, and spatial motion in transmit and receive platforms [1]. Still, a FSOC system on a mobile platform will likely need to operate over a very broad range of conditions, e.g., link distance, geographic location, and time of day. In the past few years, there have been significant improvements in modeling environmental factors that affect the transmission of optical beams through the open air. This is especially true for the lower atmosphere in the boundary layer [2,3]. If environmental information, such as GPS coordinates, time of day, and meteorological measurements are available in real time, and the models can calculate optical turbulence parameters quickly, the FSOC system could adapt itself to improve its performance. This would provide additional resilience beyond that provided by the margin of the link power budget without resorting to a secondary radio frequency (RF) channel. The end goal of this SBIR topic is to develop (Phase I and II) and demonstrate (Phase III) an approach to adapting a FSOC only system within engineering constraints combined with sufficient environmental modeling for a diverse range of geographic sites, times of day, and link paths in the atmosphere. A Phase I effort will develop a concept for adapting a FSOC system and identify the required model and input data. A Phase II effort would involve developing a fast modeling code and demonstrating the FSOC adaptation concept in computer simulation. Conducting laboratory or outdoor field experiments would be a plus. A Phase III effort would demonstrate the full prototype adaptive FSOC system in the field at multiple sites in day and night times.",348,2251,1,No,No,No,,"Devise an initial approach to adapting a FSOC system (beam properties, wavelength, encoding, etc.).

The simulations should be done with an emphasis on determining which parameters and inputs contribute most to improving system performance. Conduct relevant experiments, either in a laboratory or the open air, to validate correlation of computer simulations with empirical results. The correlation must include an estimate of uncertainty of the computer simulations for a variety of parameters and inputs.

A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Bulk material properties include things like density, acoustics, bulk modulus, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, etc. that are independent of the size or amount of material deposited. The idea is that, when you have a good cold spray deposit (well bonded, good adhesion, good coupon results, etc.) from a developed, well controlled cold spray process, it will exhibit bulk material properties that will differ from a poor cold spray deposit (different density, acoustics, bulk modulus, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, etc.), and the NDE method(s) would be able to measure a subset (most likely) of the bulk material properties to determine whether a cold spray deposit is a good deposit or a poor/bad deposit. Therefore it is up to the individual offerors to determine which bulk material property(ies) their NDE method(s) will need to evaluate to determine the acceptability of a cold spray deposit.

A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">1. In Phase I, the offerors should demonstrate their NDE method(s)&rsquo;s capability by showing the smallest defect size that their NDE method(s) is capable of detecting with certainty. Ideally, the NDE method would be able capable of detecting defects of any linear size, however in practice this is unrealistic. The 0.010 inch size listed in the topic call is upper bound of what is expected (should be capable of detecting indications smaller than 0.010 inches) in terms of detection capability, for, as stated in the topic call, indications up to 0.010 inch are allowed for FPI of non-CSI (lower quality) parts and the focus of this SBIR effort is an NDE method for CSI parts where no indications are allowed. </font></font>

<font face=""Calibri""><font><font color=""#000000"">2. Damaged parts undergoing cold spray repair may be either flat, curved, or of complex geometry (inside of a hole or fillet radius, etc). Types of parts which has been repaired with cold spray are static masts and gearbox housings. Mr. Wesley Cass&rsquo;s recent paper &lsquo;Machining Cold Spray Additive Manufacture for the UH-60 Main Transmission Sump&rsquo; is another example. However, the Army is looking to expand cold spray repair of aircraft components across the board as technology and capabilities improve.&nbsp; </font></font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">5. Current substrate/deposited materials are magnesium and aluminum alloys, with the potential for steel and other metallic systems in the future. Therefore, material degradation of the substrate/deposit (through corrosion, etching, chemical reaction, etc.) by any liquids contacting the part (via immersion or otherwise) should be considered. Immersion requirements of NDE method(s) will not be a cause for rejection of the method. Cold spray repair will be performed in a depot-type facility or contracted out to a cold spray repair facility. The non-destructive examination will then be performed in a similar type environment.

Qualified performers must demonstrate that they have a cold spray capability (in-house or partnership with a company). Samples must be provided containing intentional defects created by this carefully controlled cold spray bonding capability, and the NDE techniques to be developed must detect at least 90% of the defects. The existing NDE method of fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) only evaluates the surface. The requirement is for sub-surface NDE of the cold spray bonded interface for use in structural flight critical safety item (CSI) restoration. Since bulk material properties of the cold sprayed coating may influence bond condition, NDE methods must also determine acceptable bulk material properties of the cold spray coating. NDE methods shall be explored and a solution provided to characterize these conditions. There is a need for developing a nondestructive examination method that will determine if the interface bond is intact without destroying the part. This is critical for flight safety on Army aviation components. Defects within the deposit can be the weak areas allowing for fatigue crack initiation and growth. These defects need to be ascertained so the cold spray deposit onto the substrate has acceptable strength, elongation, fatigue resistant, and other characteristics to ensure it will give the same life expectancy as the original component. It is desired that the NDE capability will be developed from this SBIR to ensure that the cold spray interface bond line is not compromised when it is applied and when it is returned to the depot for overhaul to ensure continued flight safe operation after overhaul. Pre- and post-process with possible in-situ NDE development of the cold spray process shall be accomplished on cold sprayed coupons prior and after testing specifically ensuring no cracks, excessive porosity or contaminants, and good adhesion (25,000 psi). Use of cold spray process parameter adjustment or introduction of contaminants to establish a non-acceptable cold spray deposit is expected during research and development of the NDE method. Various NDE methods may include eddy current, ultrasonic, computed tomography (CT) radiology, or other techniques. The cold spray powder and process used should be sufficient to establish structural integrity on aluminum and magnesium substrates (Aluminum (Al) 7049 forged, Magnesium (MG) forged AZ80A, and Mg ZE41A) during the NDE development. Typical acceptable cold spray deposit are adherent to the substrate material, showing a uniform continuous surface free from blisters, voids, spalling, chipping, flaking, cracking, lumps (berries), loosely adherent spattered particles, and other objectionable imperfections. Microscopic examination of the cold spray does not exhibit any cracks, excessive or massive oxides or porosity when examined at a minimum magnification of 100X per ASTM E3, E407, and E1920. Oxide and porosity content are usually less than 2 percent when viewed at 100X minimum per ASTM E2109. Acceptable bond strength is near the 25000 pounds per square inch per plug bond testing. No de-bonds or delamination are to be present in the cold spray bond line. Hardness minimum is 70 Vickers minimum on as deposited 6061 cold spray powder. The CCDC AvMC Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED) has tapped Army Research Laboratory’s (ARL) cold spray research, however ARL recommended NDE process assessment of properties using frictional sliding (presented at cold spray action team (CSAT)) does not establish sub-surface evaluation at the degree of resolution needed in aviation CSI components. The success criteria is ability to detect degraded interface bond to an acceptable probability of detection (POD).",592,3957,1,No,No,No,,"Develop NDE method(s) to determine an acceptable cold spray interface bond during the cold spray process, inclusive of cold spray coating bulk material properties. The innovation desired of phase I is to give the Army aviation the capability to detect subsurface (internal) cold spray flaws from the smallest critical size, interface delamination, bulk properties in thin, medium thick, and thick deposits. The offeror shall be able to inspect subsurface (internal) flaws for any linear size indications. (Note- current critical size visibly detectable on surface inspection via NDE method(s).) Comparison example of external surface inspection criteria (using NDE method fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI)) on critical safety items (CSI) requires detection of cracks and corrosion (any linearity size visually detectable) and thru-wall indications (any linearity size visually detectable), of which no indications are allowed. Using NDE surface method FPI, non-CSI parts (lower quality) may allow indications of up to 0.010 inch in diameter of porosity/cold shuts/shrinkage/inclusions. The effort shall require cold spray of coupons with NDE development pre- and post-evaluation and in-situ of subsurface (internal). The cold spray ranges from the thin coatings (deposits) (0.010 -0.050 inch thick coatings), medium thick coatings (deposits) (0.1 – 0.5 inch thick coatings), and thick coatings (deposits) (0.5 – 1 inch thick coatings). This NDE developed method(s) should include the capability to detect the cold spray interface bond line for any linearity size delamination, cracks, porosity, contaminants, and weak cold spray bonded interface resulting from cold spray parameters (e.g. critical velocity, pressures, gas flow, etc.) while providing quantitative material condition results. The offeror will be required to develop detection methods for subsurface (internal) flaws in the thin and medium coatings, linear or diameter. If successful on the thin and medium thick coatings, then the thick coatings will be attempted as well.

Upon successful demonstration of thin and medium thick coatings, then thick coatings (0.5-1 inch) shall be demonstrated in subparagraphs a. through c. For NDE detection development it is expected that an unacceptable cold spray process will require seeding of faults (parameter adjustment, contaminant introduction, etc.). The material characterization of the cold spray shall be accomplished during the research effort and be inclusive of failure mechanisms, residual stress, microstructure, microhardness, mechanical properties, etc. The deliverable of the project includes recommendation of inspection equipment and NDE method(s) along with substantiated results. All research and development processes shall be documented and reported for potential replication. NDE methods with greatest promise shall be highlighted and recommended for Phase II demonstration.","Deliverable will be the design, development, and fabrication of a prototype NDE method(s) from phase I to include motion control, data acquisition system, data reduction (software), used to detect sub-surface cold spray interface bond and bulk material properties characterization during research and development of statistically sound repeatable results for aerospace application of the cold spray process. The success criteria will be an established probability of detection (POD) 90 % with 95% confidence. The offeror shall develop a NDE method to along with the examination of the cold spray interface bond. This phase II will assess, describe, and develop a NDE method that will establish the ability to detect a particular defect, (delamination, crack, porosity, contaminants, weak cold spray bonded interface) along with identifying the size, orientation, and location of the defect. Typical four options that constitute the probability matrix of include- 1. An item is flawed and the NDE method detects it (True Positive). 2. No flaw exists and the NDE method indicates a flow present (False Positive). 3. An item is flawed and the NDE method does not detect it (False Negative). 4. No flaw exists and the NDE method has no indication of a flaw (True Negative). Probability of detection (POD) studies such as this SBIR is requiring for development is to be done, possibly by plotting the accumulation of flaws detected by a newly developed NDE method against the flaw size of all flaws “detected” (or that produce a response over some threshold). Ideally all flaws over some critical size will be detected and flaws smaller than that are not “detected”. A common tool used for POD is the POD curve, probability of detection versus flaw height. A demo system will be developed incorporating the NDE method including all data processing methods developed in Phase I and Phase II.","Upon successful completion of Phases I and II, the actual NDE method will be implemented in a cold spray additive repair process for actual Army aviation components. The demo system built in Phase II will be modified and adapted for inspection of selected prototype part geometries. Finally, the cold spray repaired prototype components will undergo full scale fatigue testing as required by Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED) using the NDE demo system for inspection and quantifying degraded cold spray properties and adhesion.

Mission requirements such as extended range/endurance, increased power, low altitude operation without detection, and high reliability are becoming paramount. These requirements are not currently fully realized with conventional rotary, internal combustion, or turbine-based propulsion. Electrical power requirements for advanced payloads is also increasing, which adds weight to the air vehicle. Current UAS conventional engines tend to be noisy, which can limit UAS operational capabilities. Various advanced engine concepts offer the potential for significantly increased power to weight/volume ratio. The objective of this topic is to develop advanced, small engines (approximately 10-30 horsepower) which can fit in a defined installation envelope while having low noise characteristics and low specific fuel consumption (threshold 1.2 lb/hp-hr, objective 0.6 lb/hp-hr). The threshold size for the installation envelope is no larger than 13 inch height by 10 inch width by 21 inch length, while the objective size is 10 inch height by 10 inch width by 21 inch length. The output shaft should be aligned parallel to the length axis. Specific power goals for proposed engines (including the weight of all ancillaries required for operation such as control systems, cooling systems, gearbox (if required to meet output speed below), etc.) are .5 hp/lb threshold and 1.5 hp/lb objective. Reliability goals for proposed engines includes mean time between overhaul (1000 hours threshold, 2000 hour objective) and mean time between essential function failure (1000 hours threshold, 2000 hour objective). Additional key capabilities include the ability of the engine to operate off of heavy-fuel (JP-8, diesel, and alternative fuels) and ability to provide power to electrical payloads (1 kW).

Typical HUMS systems receive inputs from the airframe, engines, and avionics and analyzes the data in real time to provide updates on the state of the vehicle. Data trends such as an increase in vibration on a specific component can be used to identify the beginning of a catastrophic failure and provide the pilot with the information, preventing loss of the vehicle. Fiber optic based sensing and data collection has the advantage of being significantly lighter than more traditional measurement methods, immune to EMI from other sources, passive such that an RF signal is not emitted from the vehicle, and enables highly multiplexed sensing such that >40 measurements can be made on a single channel. With the increasing use of composite structures, the ability to detect and interpret fatigue failure and cracking in addition to vibration measurements is highly desired. Due to the flexibility of optical fiber systems, it is strongly encouraged that the developed system supports additional measurements and measurement locations on the vehicle. It is also strongly encouraged that offerers demonstrate a relationship with a successful military systems integrator as part of the transition plan.

In addition, these systems face ever increasing threats to GPS availability. These factors are driving advancement in small and inexpensive, yet high-performance, inertial sensor technology. MEMS technology has demonstrated small form factors for relatively inexpensive inertial components that are suitable for tactical grade operation. However, as missile systems decrease in size and must operate for extended periods of time in GPS-denied environments, future small inertial sensors must demonstrate increasingly higher levels of performance. MEMS inertial sensors utilizing electrostatic, piezoelectric, and magnetic proof mass displacement readout approaches have achieved success in both commercial- and defense-related applications. However, there is a desire for improved performance suitable for navigation-grade applications. This program proposes the development of technology that could yield the next generation Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) navigation-grade inertial sensor. The majority of MEMS inertial sensors utilize electromechanical readout of the motion of a micromachined proof mass. It is anticipated that these “traditional” MEMS pickoff techniques (capacitive, magnetic, piezoelectric, etc.) will not be able to achieve the required performance levels. Optical readout of mechanical displacements has demonstrated high levels of resolution in macro-scale applications including precision movement and placement systems. In addition, optical techniques are common in high performance inertial sensors such as fiber optic gyros and ring laser gyros. Incorporating optical readout approaches into MEMS acceleration devices may yield sufficient resolution to achieve navigation-grade performance. However, the integration of micro-optical components within MEMS devices suffers from multiple issues. Hybrid integration of micro-optical components is commonplace for electro-optic devices such as tunable lasers, modulators, detector arrays, and other complex optical systems. However, for MEMS components with released microstructures, the required microassembly processes suffer from the need to perform component alignment, place and contain adhesives, and attach components to movable structures. In addition, hybrid microassembly is not amenable to wafer-scale processing, leading to difficulties in controlling final component cost. Monolithic integration of micro-optical components within MEMS inertial sensors addresses these issues by providing benefits such as self-alignment and wafer-level fabrication. However, the fabrication of micro-optical components, such as lenses, mirrors, and beam splitters, directly within MEMS components has been limited primarily to the creation of out-of-plane features. These features can be used to realize out-of-place optical MEMS inertial sensors through approaches such as wafer stacking. However, there are few options for fabricating in-plane micro-optical features that can realize in-plane MEMS inertial sensors. The goal of this program is to develop approaches to realize in-plane MEMS inertial sensors that utilize monolithically fabricated micro-optical components for precise proof mass position sensing, thereby enabling high levels of inertial sensor performance without increasing potential form factors and costs. 3-D microfabrication approaches can include such items as sidewall micromachining to achieve vertical high-quality micro optical surfaces, multi-level waveguide fabrication approaches to guide light between sources, detectors, and various micro-optical surfaces on the MEMS structure, self-assembled structures to create micro-optical functionality after chip fabrication, amongst other techniques.

A: The solicitation does not list preference to applying to all or just selected waveforms. Both are of interest, as could be other approaches, and there could be advantages to each.

Q2 (06/12/2020): Is GPS timing/frequency reference allowed or the solution should be GPS-less?
A: The solution must work in a GPS denied environment and may take advantage of GPS if available.

Q3 (06/12/2020): The solicitation mentions that ""The ability to update existing tactical radios with this capability via software/firmware update is highly desirable."" Is this a must or nice-to-have requirement? In other words, are solutions that require minimal hardware modifications responsive?
A: The software/firmware approach is highly desirable. Other approaches which include, but not limited to, minimal hardware modifications would be considered.

Distributed beamforming techniques have matured significantly over the past decade, but currently rely on unique waveforms often with costly computational and hardware requirements. The ability to apply distributed beamforming techniques to non-developmental waveforms can greatly facilitate integration of the technology into tactical communications architectures. Distributed beamforming using dismounted soldier radios can emulate an antenna array and obtain power and/or directivity gains which are proportional to the number of dismounted radios, and be used to deliver a common message to a mounted receiver or possibly another collection of dismounted soldiers. Beneﬁts of distributed beamforming include energy eﬃciency, improved communication range (or an equivalent lowering in detection range with respect to an adversary), interference rejection, and possibly the ability to spatially multiplex streams of data if desired. The C5ISR Center particularly seeks techniques, which can be used for squad level communications. The Army squad must be able to communicate with a separated parent vehicle in poor visibility or over restrictive terrain in a manner which reduces vulnerability to enemy interception/detection (LPI/LPD) and enhances Anti-Jam (AJ) capabilities in congested/contested environments. The US Army SBIR office and C5ISR Center are requesting information related to distributed beamforming methods designed for dismounted soldiers where each soldier has a radio and omnidirectional antenna, and where each soldier acts as a node in the distributed dismounted beamforming system. The dismounted soldiers must be able to communicate, in a cooperative manner, with a radio mounted on a vehicle, where the mounted radio may use multiple antennas. The capability must demonstrate AJ/LPI/LPD characteristics while operating in a congested/contested environment. Waveforms in consideration for this effort should be non-developmental in nature. The ability to update existing tactical radios with this capability via software/firmware update is highly desirable. The approach should maximize portability and backwards compatibility to tactical radio systems which will support widespread implementation and reduce overall cost. Consideration will be given to government owned and government purpose waveforms. The Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) DoD Information Repository and JTNC Tactical Communications Marketplace, both available at https://www.public.navy.mil/jtnc/Pages/home.aspx, are resources to gain access to these waveforms. The proposal should contain information regarding the beamforming (or diversity) implementation, and specifically how LPI and LPD are improved by the beamforming methods. Furthermore, the proposal should contain any information regarding the characteristics of the beamforming methods that facilitate improved resistance to intentional and non-intentional interference, both from enemy and friendly forces in congested/contested environments. Typical concepts of operation would include forward dismounted reach-back to a vehicular platform that may or may not be under condition of enemy electronic warfare (EW) attack (electronic support (ES) and electronic attack (EA)), support for route clearing operations that might use a Counter Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive EW (CREW) device to block enemy communications, and tactical dismounted operations in dense urban terrain typical of building search and clearing, which are assumed to be highly congested/contested environments. The system must provide up-echelon communications to at least 5000m to a reach back node that is mounted or dismounted. The solution must also provide communications, AJ, LPI, and LPD capabilities when the reach-back distance is lower than 5000m. Frequency Bands of interest are VHF, UHF, L-Band, and S-Band. Real time voice, push-to-talk (PTT), and data demonstration is expected as a part of this effort. Open standard and non-proprietary interfaces shall be available for connection of audio and data connection ports. Data rates will be available to support transfer of voice and position location information. Solutions which provide additional data rates which support file transfer and streaming video services are also of interest.",613,4474,1,No,No,No,,"The Phase I effort shall include a feasibility study of the incorporation of distributed beamforming methods to non-developmental waveforms to include frequency offset and time/phase synchronization as well as the impacts of other waveform aspects such as modulation and coding. Additionally an overall consideration of system architecture feasibility incorporating the various individual blocks (modulation, synchronization, demodulation, etc.) should be included. An analysis of the theoretical limits of the various technical approaches shall be presented in addition to any practical limitations for the approaches. Analysis should be reinforced with simulation of the approaches. The Phase I effort will identify the optimal approach and provide a recommendation for Phase II implementation. The Phase I deliverable will be a report documenting the results of the feasibility study and simulation software with short exemplary use-cases for the simulation software allowing reproduction of some key simulation results from the report.","The Phase II effort shall implement and demonstrate the operation of a TRL 5/6 prototype distributed beamforming system using a non-developmental waveform(s). The prototype systems shall incorporate the techniques researched in Phase I. The prototype shall be delivered to the government with an associated user manual and a report documenting the results of the Phase II effort. The system is expected to be evaluated and demonstrated at the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center Ground Activity in Ft. Dix, NJ. The demonstration shall include full beamforming with a minimum of 4-nodes. The system architecture should be scalable and support team sizes of at least 11-nodes. It is further desirable to support squad-to-squad beamforming without a dedicated base station. The Army is interested in performance in unobstructed line of sight (LOS), restricted, and urban terrains under benign and contested electromagnetic environments. The Phase II effort shall include an operationally relevant field demonstration of the prototype systems, which demonstrates at least real-time transfer of voice/PTT and position location information (PLI) data.

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">The US Army&rsquo;s current legacy system requirements for Tactical OTM SATCOM over GEO satellites ONLY, describe a mechanically steered, single beam, pedestal based system. These are limited to use on the HMMWV with a SWaP of 30&rdquo;x30&rdquo; square, a two man lift weight of &lt;100 lbs., and max power draw of 650 W for the SNE terminal. This gimbaled reflector has an EIRP of 42 dBW at Ku and 45 dBW at Ka with a G/T of 12 dB/K for both Ku and Ka. These systems were designed to communicate with legacy GEO satellites (i.e. FSS) to provide a single encrypted VOIP connection back to the Tactical Operations Center operating at 256kbps. The terminals operate over a single RF band (Ku or Ka), based on their setup (Note: they are manually reconfigurable for Ku or Ka band operation).</font></font></font></font></font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">With the emerging MEO and LEO constellations, the Army is targeting distinct improvements over legacy capabilities. The Army is interested in terminals that operate on multiple bands and with multiple links (at least 2) simultaneously, with the primary objective of providing SATCOM resiliency. Ku and Ka (military and commercial) Bands remain our favored frequency bands for use, with the possible inclusion of X-band. The ability for the system to receive from at least 2 satellites in LEO, MEO or GEO simultaneously is ideal as it enables a make-before-break transition. Other types of simultaneous links can also be explored, including simultaneous transmit. Target instantaneous BW for any single carrier is up to 1 GHz.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">These system are likely to be mounted on armored and turreted vehicles (JLTV, Bradley, Abrams, NGCV, etc.) along with traditional HMMWV integration. These vehicles have varying integration considerations (on vehicle blockages, possibility to have distributed system, limited real-estate on vehicle, limited power, limited weight, active armor, etc.).</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Due to the uptick in capability of a single objective multiband, multibeam LEO/MEO/GEO SATCOM terminal, the Army is anticipating a larger power draw for the SATCOM terminal (i.e. &gt; 650W). However, every watt of available power on these vehicles is consumed by essential equipment. So the bottom line is that the less power consumed by the SATCOM system enables greater capability for the overall vehicle configuration. SWaP-C trade analysis is encouraged in phase 1, with Government participation.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">RF performance (i.e. EIRP, G/T etc.) should meet or exceed that of legacy hardware for GEO satellites and include the dynamic range necessary for use on LEO and MEO constellations. System must meet MIL-STD-188-164C and other MIL-STD specifications as they pertain to specific frequency bands and other requirements. Ideal OTM SATCOM systems should be capable of look angles 10&deg; below nominal horizon elevation (-10&deg; El) and have continuous azimuth coverage (360&deg; Az), due to the vehicle dynamics when OTM.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Ideal system should be low cost, proposal should indicate cost per unit as number of units scales ($/100 units, $/1,000 units, $/10,000 units, etc.). Current product costs range from ~$100k-$200k per unit in quantities of 100 units. The Army is interested in a 10X improvement in this area.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Notes to consider for trades analysis:</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">NOTE: No X-band assets are known to exist below GEO and none are anticipated in the near future</font></font></font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">NOTE: GEO High Throughput Satellites (HTS) are currently being deployed by commercial vendors and have lower terminal requirements for similar or greater performance. While WGS satellites are expected to remain in service 10+ years, more capable satellites may make currently disadvantaged terminals more desirable as cost and complexity are reduced.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">NOTE: Full solutions are desired but partial solutions with reasonable trades are also encouraged. This is a new capability we are seeking, so in your proposal tell us what your solution is capable of providing and how.</font></font>

Q2 (06/03/2020): Can the TPOC suggest interface options/standards between the prototype terminal and a representative SATCOM radio (or unit for future testing)?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">L-band is the standard IF interface used by Army modems. Modems used by new satellite service providers may differ but likely should have compatible interfaces. </font></font>

Q3 (06/03/2020): Could we get some threshold and desired values of bandwidth, EIRP, receiver gain/Temperature, SWaP, field of regard, and angular resolution (both horizontal and vertical) for the Phase I design?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">See answer to the question submitted on 06/08/2020 asking for the SATCOM requirements document, most of the answers to this question can be found there.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Angular resolution and speed must be sufficient to track GEO satellites with low loss (&lt;0.8dB) under clear weather conditions when operating OTM, please see MIL-STD-188-164C, Section A.3 Antenna pointing loss.</font></font>

Q4 (05/19/2020): Does the TPOC see it as a strength for the proposer to be partnered with established DoD supplier of SATCOM systems?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Since this question does not pertain to specific information related to improving the understanding of topic requirements, it is out of the scope of available answers. The soundness, technical merit and innovation of the proposed approach, qualifications of principal investigators, supporting staff, and consultants, and potential for commercialization will all be evaluated once proposals are submitted. </font></font>

Q5 (05/19/2020): Are there options for a ""Fast-track Phase I / Phase 2"" or a ""Direct-to-Phase-2"" on this funding opportunity?

The Army intends to integrate this capability into the existing Army GEO SATCOM terminals, to provide resilient transport links for multiple networks simultaneously. As the technology development organization for the U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC), the Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center, provides research, development and engineering support for Army satellite communications. In this role, STCD is seeking to partner with a small business to develop a new satellite antenna capability of supporting communications diversity on the battlefield. The focus is on providing an affordable technology that has the potential to meet performance requirements to close multiple simultaneous connections to geosynchronous and other Wideband SATCOM systems, typically at X, Ku, and Ka bands. The antenna technology is required to meet Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) requirements for integration on a ground tactical vehicle. The antenna technology will be required to support tracking for LEO, MEO and GEO satellites. The antenna must present an innovative path forward for cost reduction that will contribute to an affordable resilient next generation tactical terminal with multi-beam capability. The multi-beam antenna technology should be capable of supporting multi-megabit per second connections to multiple satellites simultaneously in different types of orbit, and be easily deployed. The technology is meant to be deployed on a ground tactical vehicle and should use commercial processes to drive affordability. This capability when complete will support added resiliency for the U.S. Army and Multi-Domain Operations (MDO) mission threads in a contested environment which aligns directly with Army Modernization Priorities, Long Range Precision Fires, Next Generation Combat Vehicle and Army Network. Historically, parabolic dish antennas have been the chosen architecture for Tactical SATCOM systems. These systems make up the majority of the Army’s tactical vehicle inventory. Parabolic dish antennas offer a low cost solution, with antenna performance that meets military requirements for Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP), Receive Gain / Temperature (G/T), and SWaP. However, these systems are limited in providing multi-beam and multi-band solutions necessary for an integrated LEO, MEO, GEO SATCOM capability. A second type of antenna, heavily used for Military SATCOM are phased arrays. These antennas offer multi-beam and multi-band solutions, but are often challenged with the total cost and field-of-regard (i.e. performance at low elevation angles) which is critical for performance on tactical vehicles. A new generation of Army tactical terminals is necessary to meet existing military performance requirements and provide a multi-beam, multi-band SATCOM capable solution, with the broad field-of-regard critical for Army tactical vehicles, at a cost the Army can afford. Lens antennas offer a host of new architectures, from which to build a multi-band, multi-beam terminal. Lenses, similar to dishes, passively focus Electro Magnetic (EM) waves which greatly reduces antenna cost. Further, lens technology offers 3-dimensional way to collect electromagnetic waves, and therefore provide the field-of-regard critical for Army tactical vehicles.",490,3482,1,No,No,No,,"Develop an initial design of a SATCOM lens antenna and terminal, meeting the Government performance requirements for Tactical SATCOM OTM (available from Government TPOC, upon request).

The UGS would be readily distributed within an area of interest to provide the ability to sense the Cyber-Electromagnetic Environment (C-EME), allowing for the acquisition of data required to achieve Cyberspace Situational Understanding (CYBER SU) and improve network survivability. The collected sensor data would support multiple objectives, to include environment mapping, specific signal of interest detection and geo-referencing, and battle damage assessment. In addition, the UGS could be deployed hundreds of miles forward of a Forward Line of Troops (FLOT) from platforms such as high altitude (i.e. >60K feet) balloons to support acquisition of target data for long-range precision fires. The sensors could leverage emerging Internet of Things (IoT) protocols (or comparable performing waveforms) for data retrieval.

In future conflicts, it would be necessary to deploy imaging capability to squad and individual Soldiers. While Longwave Infrared (LWIR) uncooled thermal imaging capability is gradually becoming available to Soldiers, these cameras do not offer flexibility in F/#, sensitivity, frame-rates, or range. High performance Midwave Infrared (MWIR) and LWIR quantum detector based imaging systems can solve many of these issues. However, the cooling requirements, Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) and high cost of production prevents high performance systems at the Soldier level and smaller platforms. Traditional approaches to increase operating temperature in MWIR and LWIR detectors that can operate near room temperature have been unsuccessful. A new approach whereby photon to electron transduction that take advantage of efficient charge transfer across a hetero-interface to separate electron-hole pairs is needed. A recent body of research1-3 in two-dimensional materials has demonstrated promising new optoelectronic devices based on near-field coupling via interface charge transfer. More studies are needed to understand the hetero-interfaces. The underlying concept in these studies is to implement mechanisms similar to Förster or Drexel energy transfer for electron or hole collection leading to very efficient processes. These studies also show promise to increase the operating temperature. For example, energy transfer across van-der-waals hybrids of graphene and transition metal di-chalcogenides may occur via simultaneous two‐way electron transfer via exchange interaction or near‐field non-radiative energy transfer mechanisms such as dipole‐dipole coupling. It should be noted that these studies have been mostly focused on detection of near infrared radiation. There has not been any major work in the longer wavelengths.

Can you confirm if the technology for the Bolometer FPA is based on VOx technology or something else?  This can affect the electronics that need to be proposed.
2.	As the pitch size is reduced, the thermal conductivity of the sensor elements goes up.  This can cause increased noise of the sensor and reduce the sensitivity.  Can you give some information on the detector sensitivity that you expect to use with the ROIC?
3.	As the pitch size is reduced, the thermal time constant will also change â though it is primarily determined by the material used.  Can you comment on what will be the thermal time constant for the sensor element?  This is important because you are asking for frame rates of 120 Hz to 240 Hz, but if the thermal time-constant is large, we can expect the image to smear and the higher frame rate will not help in giving a good video image  (as you expect from the frame rate).

A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">A1. As you may be aware, unlike other sensor types which traditionally hybridize an FPA to a ROIC, bolometers are fabricated monolithically on the ROIC wafer.&nbsp; This means you must work very closely with a domestic bolometer manufacturer and their technology; this is not a relationship which the Government can mandate, nor is it required that this relationship be established for the proposal.&nbsp; Given the current state of the Industry in the US, it would be reasonable to assume VOx.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">A2. Historically, bolometer technology has improved such that each new smaller bolometer pitch maintains or improves overall performance (e.g. Figure of Merit) with respect to the previous size node.&nbsp; We certainly hope this trend continues.</font></font>

In nearly all cases there is a SWaP concern, and for many applications it is paramount. A way to increase sensor performance for a given SWaP is to decrease the pixel pitch. The current standard pitch is 12 μm. DoD and industry investments are being made to improve pixel design to enable small pixels, but currently no ROICs exist to take advantage of these investments. As the pixel gets smaller, it becomes more of a challenge to fit appropriate ROIC circuitry within the available space. To overcome this hurdle, hybrid or fully digital circuit architectures may need to be used, perhaps in conjunction with novel physical architectures and fabrication techniques. However, the most desirable approaches will include as many as possible of the following features: • ≥ 120 Hz full-frame frame rate, preferably ≥ 240 Hz; windowing to even higher frame rates • Very low power, suitable for small autonomous platform or Soldier-borne applications • Resolution of ≥1280×1024 pixels • Bolometer-limited noise performance (ROIC does not significantly degrade noise performance of bolometer) • Low-cost fabrication techniques and processes • Very high intra-scene temperature dynamic range",201,1296,1,No,No,No,,The proposer shall design and model a small pixel ROIC for uncooled LWIR bolometer sensor applications that supports as many of the desired features listed above as possible.,"The proposer shall fabricate a small pixel ROIC based on phase I results.

1) Is this intended to establish the accuracy of the proposerâs model to the empirical collection data?
2) Is this intended to measure actual detection performance for different materials based on the model?
3) Something else? Can you provide an example for reference?
A: <font color=""#000000"">This intent is to establish the accuracy of the proposer&#39;s model to the empirical collection data.</font>

Q2 (06/17/2020): What types of visualization tools are desired?
1) False coloring, heatmaps, and highlighting polarization differences?
2) Custom detection/classification algorithms that automatically detect anomalies between polarizations and provide an AOI
3) Something else?
A: Excellent question. We encourage any of their suggestions that will be useful in supporting the sensor operator. The government does not want to constrain the way an offeror might address the objective.

Q3 (06/17/2020): Does the modeling need to include detailed BRDF analysis of the objects?
A: 

Q4 (06/17/2020): Is there a desired angular sampling for testing with linear polarization?  Such as collection at 45-deg rotation increments (i.e. 0, 45, 90, 135)?
A: The angular sampling should be sufficient to achieve the objective. Sampling at 0, 45, 90, and 135 is acceptable as well as others.

Q5 (06/17/2020): With the large number of variables involved, performing detailed collection across the full breadth of system/target/environment combinations may not be practical. Are you able to provide some constraints for the overall analysis?
1) Such as the range of environmental conditions (i.e. ambient temperature ranges, desired weather conditions, solar geometry, etc.)
2) Do you have a list of desired targets/objects that can be used for evaluation? (For instance, a particular type of camouflage, anodized metal, etc.)
3) Do you have desired list of backdrop environments to contrast with object (i.e. dense foliage, littoral, rock face, etc)?
A: The government would like to avoid over-constraining the problem or making suggestions that would lead to unintended expensive solutions. Temperate forests, grasslands, and arid environments within vicinity of offeror are realistic and practical. Certain weather conditions are not practical for polarization and should not be considered. Lighting that will stress the polarization cameras should be considered such as dawn and dusk. Full daylight as a baseline is also desired. Tests in open fields may be done to establish some background baseline data. Tests in areas where reflections will occur are also desirable. For bidding purposes, offerors may consider ordinarily available targets and backgrounds.&nbsp; Specifics will be discussed at the start of the program.

Q6 (06/17/2020): Can collection hardware and polarizers be purchased as GFE under contract?
A: Within reason, yes. GFE of materials will be considered within the context of the offeror&rsquo;s proposal.

Q7 (06/17/2020): Are there specific requirements for the polarizers used? (1) Linear vs. Circular? (2) Desired ranges for Transmission, Polarization Efficiency, Extinction Ratio, etc?
A: &nbsp;Linear polarization is required. Circular polarization is not necessary. The government will not be specifying polarizer properties because the connection between these properties and the objectives of this project have not been established. Generally, it is desired that limits in performance be due to scene properties and/or other camera limitations rather than polarizer filter properties. Our experience is such that reasonable care in selection will provide this.

Q8 (06/17/2020): You state that reflective band analysis is preferred for the solution.  If test data is to be captured by the proposer, are there specific requirements for the imaging hardware?
1) Are you interested in the whole visual spectrum in general (i.e. panchromatic imagery) or individual spectra across the visible range?
2) Would multispectral/hyperspectral analysis be more useful for the desired solution than RGB or panchromatic?
3) Are there any other specific camera requirements (i.e. resolution, spectral sensitivity, bit-depth, etc.)
A: <font color=""#000000"">While preference is given to reflective band analysis, there is no specific requirement for which waveband(s) should be utilized within the reflective region or the emissive region.

The polarimetric data sets are multi-modal and include polarization magnitude, orientation, and conventional intensity information. The physics behind polarimetric signatures is complex and is dependent on the material properties of the scene elements, the shape and the surface characteristics of the objects in the scene, the look angle of the sensor, the relative position of any illumination sources, the relative temperatures of the objects in the scene and the background, and background conditions including weather, cloud cover and the presence and temperature of objects in line of sight of the imaged field of view. Although a first principle model that includes all of these considerations would provide a means to analyze situations and mission parameters in which the enhancement from polarization sensing is optimized, an accurate physics-based model is not practicable. Instead, we seek a hybrid empirical/physical model based on physical modeling and enough testing to develop empirical detection models that can be used to set the mission parameters.

Single element mm sized detectors made from bulk HgCdTe crystals in the 1960s have been transformed today through research into arrays having more than one million elements with each element measuring below 20 micrometers. This has resulted in DoD infrared systems having much greater sensitivity at a much larger field of view. One major drawback to such large arrays, however, is the yield of such arrays is dramatically reduced by large defects in the HgCdTe film which cause many adjacent HgCdTe detectors to be defective with high noise and lower signal. Recent research has identified the cause of some of these large defects as arising from an imperfect CdZnTe substrate surface. Even after addressing this issue, however, large HgCdTe epitaxial film defects are still driving down the yield of large arrays making their costs rise to prohibitive levels for some applications. New non-destructive technologies are sought which will identify defects below the surface of the single crystal CdZnTe substrate which cause large, yield limiting defects in the HgCdTe films.

Inkjet printing can be used to produce these types of color-change assays at the point of need by replacing standard ink cartridges with indicator reagent cartridges. On-demand printing can also be used to produce purpose-built assays tailored to the task at hand by selecting relevant indicators to combine together on assays customized in size and format.

Q2 (06/01/2020): In a motor driver application, what is the peak RPM that will need to be supported or are the motors AC mains connected only, not permanent magnet type?
A: <font color=""#000000"">There is not a specific requirement provided in the topic description for peak RPM.&nbsp; The target platforms, OMFV and RCV, in the topic description would provide general bounds for that type of requirement.</font>

Q5 (06/01/2020): Batteries have much more limited thermal operating range than electronic components, approximately 60degC for the majority of lithium batteries compared to 115degC or higher for electronic components.  Limiting the temperature of electronic components in order to package batteries and electronics together will sacrifice the power density of the electronics.  One way to mitigate that effect is to package them with a thermal barrier so the waste heat generated by the electronics can get to the ambient without heating up the batteries.  But the thermal barrier is also almost two packages that are joined.  Would a solution that is modular and allows batteries and electronics to be joined without cables be considered an AC/DC battery solution?

Accordingly, diesel engine manufacturers have renewed their efforts to increase engine efficiency from the current status of 45% brake thermal efficiency (BTE) towards the theoretical limit of approximately 65% BTE. A pair of recent technical papers by Cummins, Inc. outlines the potential efficiency gains achieved through improvements in heat transfer reduction, friction reduction, lubricant viscosity, parasitic losses (e.g. oil and water pumps), turbomachinery efficiency, engine downspeeding, exhaust aftertreatment optimization, and last but not least, engine combustion system optimization (SAE 2013-01-2421 and SAE 2019-01-0247). This topic focuses on increasing the thermal efficiency of a 120mm-140mm bore size diesel engine through optimization of the combustion system and the resultant piston heat transfer. Engine combustion system developments include trends towards higher compression ratios, higher in-cylinder pressures (greater than 300 bar), piston bowl geometry optimization, and increased fuel injector flow rates to enable shorter combustion durations. As the combustion duration shortens and compression ratio increases, the cylinder pressure and temperature will necessarily increase, resulting in gas-side piston surface temperatures that exceed the material temperature limit (~500°C) of traditional steel piston alloys, such as 4140 steel. Another consideration when pursuing these technology developments is increased piston heat transfer. Shorter combustion durations necessitate higher localized heat fluxes (greater than 20 MW/m2) on the piston as the hot flame impinges on the piston bowl surfaces. Whereas the engine designs of commercial vehicles are heavily weighted towards achieving low emissions and good fuel economy, these attributes are less important in the design of military vehicles. Combat vehicle engines in particular should have high power density and low heat rejection, because the propulsion system competes with the vehicle’s functional systems for the total volume under armor. Thus, future combat engines designed for low heat rejection (< 0.5 kW/kW) and high output (90 bhp/L) share some of the design limits of a commercial engine, one of which is piston surface temperature. Temperatures above critical material property limits can result in reduced engine life and piston failure. Optimization of piston design for such low rejection, high power density engines while maintaining acceptable piston surface temperature is a critical step in the engine development process. The purpose of this topic is develop an advanced, heavy-duty diesel engine piston optimized for continuous, high-load operation at desert-ambient operating conditions for military ground combat vehicles. Proposals should aim to increase the peak cylinder pressure limit to 275 bar and the surface temperature limit to 600 °C, or propose technologies to reduce surface temperatures at equivalent thermal loading.

Will physics calculations need to be performed on the data in real time in Unreal? Interactivity, does this include things such as operable doors, windows, light switches, destructible elements of rocks, buildings, trees, and is material penetration important?
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">We&#39;re not asking for a simulation. We want a product that will classify terrain into broad categories and let us know where to locate stock objects on said terrain.

Q2 (06/18/2020): Is there a direct to Phase II option if we have a substantial portion of the pipeline for this technology already built out and can proceed quickly to delivery and into additional features?
A: Army SBIR is not currently considering Direct to Phase II proposals.

Q3 (06/17/2020): Should the Phase 1 submittal be determined to have a high enough TRL, is a Direct to Phase 2 under consideration?
A: Army SBIR is not currently considering Direct to Phase II proposals

Q4 (06/17/2020): May a subcontractor use talent from a Canadian office as long as it has the proper JCP letter in place?
A: Use of a canadian subcontractor (if your proposal is selected) will have to be decided by the contracting officer during contract negotiations

Q5 (06/17/2020): Does this Phase 1 require a working prototype at the end of Phase 1?
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">At the end of phase one we want a prototype that will produce (at a minimum) the blend weight images ready for import into Unreal Engine.

Q6 (06/11/2020): How detailed are the classification expectations for the system?  (1) Do you need to discriminate between different similar types of flora (i.e. an oak tree vs. an elm) or just broad differences (i.e. oak vs. palm).  (2)  Do seasonal effects need to be considered, such as: snow, ice, & bare trees in the winter? (3) Do you need to distinguish between different littoral regions (i.e. lake, river, ocean)?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">1. We are not aware of what the limits of current technology are. Let us know what you can do. More precise classification is better but we understand that distinguishing oak from elm may not be possible at .5m resolution.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">2. Weather is something that we will add later to the simulation. As for the classification, there won&#39;t be any clouds or snow obscuring the terrain.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">3. Marking it all as water is sufficient but, as with question #1, more detail is better. Let us know what you can do.</font></font>

Q7 (06/11/2020): Is the source data being generated from a commercial tool like Pix4D or AgiSoft? If not, will the imagery be a true orthographic (where only the rooftops of buildings are visible) or should we expect to see building layover (where the vertical surfaces of objects remain visible in the orthographic view)?  Layover artifacts may drive additional classification and inpainting considerations.
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">The data comes from a variety of sources external to us and we can&#39;t make guarantees other than it will be close to orthographic. We will do the registration and stitching to provide the data in aligned images; one for elevation, one for imagery, etc. Keep in mind that you can just mark the challenging parts and kick it back to the operator.</font></font>

Q8 (06/11/2020): Both satellite and aerial imagery are mentioned in the SBIR.  Will the data sources include both aerial/drone imagery and satellite?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">We don&#39;t have control over the sources of the data. The aerial imagery could come from satellite or drone and will be orthograhic, pre-registered, and stitched. If we have both, we will happily provide both but we can&#39;t guarantee a specific source. Let us know what you can take advantage of in your proposal.</font></font>
