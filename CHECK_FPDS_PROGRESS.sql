-- Quick queries to see what data you have and what's next

-- 1. Total contracts and data quality
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_contracts,
  ROUND(AVG(data_quality_score), 1) as avg_quality_score,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE data_quality_score >= 80) as high_quality,

-- 2. Contracts by year
SELECT

FROM fpds_contracts
WHERE calendar_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY calendar_year
ORDER BY calendar_year DESC;

-- 3. Recent scraper runs
SELECT

  total_inserted,
  total_errors,
  last_page_processed,
  started_at,
  updated_at,

    WHEN status = 'in_progress' 
    THEN ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - started_at)) / 60) 
    ELSE NULL 
  END as minutes_running
FROM fpds_scraper_log
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 4. Top agencies by contract count (2025 data)
SELECT 
  agency_name,
  COUNT(*) as contracts,
  SUM(total_obligation_amount) as total_amount,

-- 5. Date ranges that need completion (gaps in 2025)
WITH date_series AS (

FROM date_series ds
LEFT JOIN fpds_contracts fc ON fc.date_signed::date = ds.check_date
GROUP BY check_date
HAVING COUNT(fc.id) < 3  -- Days with fewer than 3 contracts might need review

-- 6. Data quality issues to fix
SELECT
