If this happens, it is anticipated that the periodic development of new test forms will be obviated and that instead, new test questions will be added to the pool and old ones deleted from the pool continuously. This process of continuously changing the item pool, and therefore the test, raises a number of theoretical and practical questions concerning the stability of the subtest and composite equatings. Test equating is the process through which scores on the psychological test are mapped onto scores on a second equivalent test. Test equating is most often used when old test forms are to be replaced with new test forms or when a ser of equivalent tests are to be used interchangeably. In these circumstances, test equating is often the primary means of establishing both the norms for, and the validity of, a new test. If, through a succession of equatings, the score scales drift, the validity of the norms and the relevance of the validity data must be questioned. With a traditional approach to test development, score-scale drift is sometimes reduced by equating successive new test forms back to the same anchor test. In the adaptive-testing environment described above, this process is impractical for it would require a new equating study of each time a test question is added or deleted from the pool.

The device is made from standard semiconductor chips. The concept is to count the errors produced from standard semiconductor memory circuits. The count of errors is a direct measure of the radiation dose to which the device has been exposed. The prototype device should incorporate various converters to control the response. It will probably make use of hybrid circuit technology. In addition to Navy applications the device should have wide use in the civilian radiation protection area. A small business responding to this solicitation should have the capability of designing and building small lots of digital circuits using purchased chips.

Without rehearsal information in short term memory is rapidly lost and the input of additional similar information leads to a more rapid degradation of the previously stored information (interference). The proposed research will investigate short term memory functioning in a combat control environment with the specific forms of information formats and interference caused by new information inputs. The anticipated outcome is a greater understanding of short term memory functioning given the unique types of information associated with a combat control environment.

These tanks attach to the bomb rack and can be jettisoned using the normal bomb release system. Jettisoning is an exceptional event, occurring only when necessary to increase aircraft combat maneuverability or reduce aircraft weight and drag in an emergency. Auxiliary tanks normally remain on the aircraft throughout a mission. An auxiliary fuel tank is a cylindrical metal container with conical ends to improve aerodynamic shape. The fineness ratio (diameter/length) is typically about 15%. Interior plumbing is provided to permit the introduction of low pressure air which is used to force fuel through a feline to the aircraft interior tankage. The attachment points to the aircraft are two standard bomb lugs spaced either 14” or 30” apart which bracket the tank center of gravity. These are mounted in a strong back structure at the top of the tank which also supports air and fuel connections to mating connectors in the weapon station. The strong back structure also provides a bearing surface for the rack ejector foot as the tank is jettisoned. Currently, tanks are of welded aluminum construction and are delivered to the user fully assembled. Current tank capacities range from 150 to 650 gallons. Auxiliary fuel tanks present a severe logistics problem. For newer aircraft, they tend to be aircraft unique. While peacetime tank environment will be high, necessitating the storage of large numbers of completely assembled spare tanks aboard ship. Combat demand is projected to be so high that carrier aircraft deck loads may be severely stressed to provide space for spare tank requirements. Finally, present tanks are excessively costly. There is a need for a standardized low-cost auxiliary tank in the 300-400 gallon range which can be delivered, disassembled, and stored aboard ship at high density in a nested configuration. Assembly of the tank aboard ship by relatively unskilled personnel should be accomplished in less than two hours. The assembled tank must have a structural integrity equal to current all-welded tanks. In particular, mechanical joints must remain secure and leak proof under the axial loads imposed by catapult launch and arrest and the normal loads imposed by aircraft maneuvering. These criteria must be met whether the tank is pressurized (transferring fuel at 4-6 psi overpressure) or unpressurized. Cost, weight, safety, and tank standardization are all important considerations. Alternative structural materials (e.g., carbon filament composites) should be investigated.

Additionally, the radio should possess a single, standard generic communications security device to ensure inter/intraoperability in the security arena. Finally, it should be reemphasized that the technology to fulfill these requirements is here today. Hopefully, future technology developments will provide weight and size reductions that could also include the super high frequency (SHF) bandwidth (3 gHz-30gHz) in a manpackable form and could expand the bandwidth of the proposed radio even further. The impact of such development would be threefold: 1. Improve inter/intraservice operability; 2. Provide a capability for graceful communications degradation in combat; 3. Reduce maintenance cost and complexity. At present, infantry line (i.e. combat) units tactical radio nets operate within three distinct portions of the frequency spectrum and utilize a variety of radios. With advancing technology, specifically very large scale integrated (VLSI) chips, great reductions in size and weight for HF, VHF, and UHF radios can be achieved. This is evidenced by the quantum size and weight improvements in the AN/PRC-104 versus it predecessor, the AN/PRC-47. Unfortunately, with present technology, the expansion of Manpack radios into the SHF and higher portions of the frequency spectrum, is constrained by the relatively large size of the crossed field oscillators (e.g. magnetrons, reflex klystrons, etc.) required to produce these frequencies. However, much larger bandwidths in a radio could, nevertheless, be achieved. This could increase the frequency range of an individual radio to include the HF, VHF, and UHF portions of the spectrum through modern advances in broadband linear amplifiers.

An innovative hardware/software approach to provide very fast execution of the MINIMUF algorithm thus unloading this specialized task from the host processor is needed. Once unloaded, the host processor can be programmed using conventional software to manipulate large MUF arrays in new and more meaningful ways to support Naval use of HF propagation with relatively inexpensive personal computer type hardware.

The threshold stress intensity parameters are difficult to obtain even in air, because of the required sensitivity for the measurement instrumentation. The data-gathering difficulty is compounded in the case of corrosion fatigue because accurate crack measurements for long-term periods in seawater are required. Therefore, a significant effort must be expended to facilitate development of methods to determine low crack growth rate and threshold data in seawater. Once an appropriate experimental technique is developed, it is anticipated that various fatigue crack growth variables, such as temperature and level of cathodic polarization could be explored. Such data should also be obtained for different shipbuilding steels. The weld and heat-affected zone also ultimately should be characterized. The objectives of this effort are to determine the threshold stress intensity parameter for corrosion fatigue crack growth rates as the threshold is approached. This would be accomplished by: a. developing a test technique appropriate for determining the threshold stress intensity parameter and corrosion fatigue crack growth rate within the long-life regime in seawater and for variables of interest (temperature, level of cathodic protection, etc.). b. Demonstrating validity of the technique by obtaining limited threshold data for the base metal of a representative Navy steel at two levels of cathodic protection and two temperatures, nominally 20 and 4 degrees C. In accomplishing the above two objectives, the project should ensure that accelerated test procedures are considered, and that relative accuracy of different crack length measurement techniques and differences between substitute electrolytes are quantified.",322,2218,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70953/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70953/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,86.6 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:46:45,,,,,N86-047_70953,DOD_SBIR_86_P1_C6_N86-047,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:57.094155+00

While some research is being done in the area and there exist various types of non-contact ranging devices, none are really practical for employment in this scenario. Existing ultrasonic ranging systems are simple and economical, but have numerous drawbacks which make them unsuitable in reality, arising from errors associated with temperature dependence, diverging beam patterns, and specular reflection from target surfaces. Also, laser based ranging systems suffer from inherent system complexity and expense, although overcoming some of the problems associated with acoustical ranging units. Simple near infrared proximity sensors, while low in cost, offer no precise range information, but just a binary indication of target vs. no target. It is desirable to develop for this system in sufficient quantity so as to provide accurate range and bearing information in all directions, thereby allowing the mobile robotic system to model its environment with sufficient accuracy so as to avoid contact with surroundings while traversing the area.

The first deals with robustness questions in Linear Multivariable Systems when plant uncertainties are structured and appear as parameters in the plant description. Specific topics that could be considered are pole assignment, observers, regulation, asymptotic tracking and transfer function shaping. The aim is to develop the theory as well as accompanying design techniques. Even though this work deals specifically with linear systems, its impact is not limited to such systems as in many occasions a linear model adequately describes the operation of a nonlinear system about some operating point. The second component considers the case when plant uncertainties are unstructured and appear as multiplicative perturbations on the transfer function of the plant. Emphasis can be placed on robust stability and robust sensitivity reduction. Such uncertainties can occur because of unmodeled dynamics, time delays, diffusion processes, etc., and may also be used to represent perturbation effects that, in fact, are not all uncertain, such as nonlinear elements (provided they are given ""conic sector” interpretations).

A small, probe-type array of eight or more hydrophone elements is required. These elements are to be configured in such a way that the acoustic Pressure, p, and particle velocity, v, can be measured simultaneously in three orthogonal directions. Determining these two field quantities allows one to numerically compute the corresponding complex intensity (I=pv) and/or the complex specific acoustic impedance (z=p/v) at any point in the field; even the field nears the radiating or scattering surface. The sources and paths of acoustic energy can be identified by having the probe scan the acoustic field produced by the vibrating submerged structure. The ability of the probe to simultaneously monitor the three-dimensional components of an acoustic field suggests that transient noise sources and responses can be determined. It is envisioned that the probe system will also include a separate projector element that will provide a control source for in-situ calibration and orientation of the array. Over the last few years the feasibility of a two or four element probe technique has been established for one-and two dimensional air-borne radiated noise diagnostics (e.g., 1-), however similar applications for underwater acoustic structures is relatively new (e.g. 6-8).

For example, wavelengths of 10mm and shorter permit quite narrow beams from modestly sized antennas; this permits in turn low elevation tracking in the presence of multipath (sea surface reflection), less off-set jamming, interference and clutter sources. Other generally accepted challenges in naval radar are the smaller cross-section targets, one’s own desire to hide one’s signal , the desire to classify targets by high resolution (multi-dimensional) signals and processing, and exploitation of the particular propagation characteristics of the medium. The use of millimeter wave radar is not itself unknown in the free-world military. The object of this work is to associate the 1990’s needs of shipborne radar with the properties of millimeter wave radar (particularly as seen in maturing systems elsewhere), and to present (relative to U.S. Navy’s present and projected radar systems) complementary features, subsystems or companion systems that could become parts of our improved systems or new development of the early 1990’s. A Phase I report will require review of these requirements, of our present systems and plans, of millimeter state of the art and equipment availability, the accomplishment of some performance and sizing calculations, and recommendations for Phase II pursuit involving experimentation and demonstration.",229,1549,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/69106/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/69106/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,87.7 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:48:07,,,,,N87-072_69106,DOD_SBIR_87_P1_C7_N87-072,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:58.31241+00

This initiative is intended to evaluate that hypothesis.

The repair and/or replacement of these damaged parts have a significant impact on readiness, logistics support costs and manpower. Currently, the only way to inhibit the FOD problem is to thicken the leading edges of fan blades and stators.

This process has been used successfully on fastener holes of fuselage sections of F-18 aircraft to increase fatigue life 3 X with no reported failures. Using a split sleeve cold expansion process, fatigue critical holes are expanded into a state of high residual compressive stress with no metallurgical changes. This process could be applied to compressor disks using an insert bushing and similar cold expansion techniques. Such a process is needed on J-52 disks because of a critical shortage of parts and the long lead times required in the procurement of new disks.

The present day technology produces power supplies which have peak efficiencies of 85% @ 5 volts (40-50% @ 2 volts) and power densities of 40 watts per cubic inch of power supply volume. The above represents the last accomplishments with the best in the electronic industry. However, if size compatibility is to be met for systems of the near future, such as VHSIC II, a breakthrough is needed to increase the efficiency to 95% @ 1.5 volts and provide power density up to 100 watts per cubic inch. A power supply must not be a dissipator; rather, it is a power conditioner which isolates, filters, changes voltage and current levels to meet detailed circuit needs. For example, logic circuits in the VHSIC require 3 volt DC levels at as much as 100 AMP current. The logic clock rates are as high as 100 MHz. Advances in power supply technology to the present time have been primarily accomplished through pulse width control circuitry and high frequency operation (up to 25 MHz in the laboratory). The increasing frequency has reduced the energy storage device volume, both in magnetics and dielectrics. The present state-of-the-art in the latter technologies has reached the limit of magnetic and dielectrics frequency characteristics. Both ferro-magnetic and dielectric (e.g., hi-K ceramics) materials degrade drastically at low megahertz frequencies. The ratios of energy storage to magnetic and dielectric losses reduce rapidly as frequency increases above 1 MHz. New materials must be developed to eliminate or relieve the energy loss problem at the required high frequencies. The reasons for increasing frequency to improve efficiency and reduce size are: (1) For a given energy storage per cycle, the power transmitted increased in direct proportion to frequency; (2) For a given power throughput energy storage decreases in proportion to cycle time; (3) For a given dielectric or magnetic material volume, there is a fixed maximum energy storage related to dielectric constant (K) of the dielectric or the permeability (M) of the magnetic material; and (4) The ""K” and ""M” properties degrade rapidly at frequencies about 1 MHz. Therefore, research and development is needed to produce: (1) Various new high frequency ferromagnetic materials for 25 to 100 MHz transformers and inductors. Ferrite materials with permeabilities greater than 50 and loss tangents less than .01 at 50 MHz could be candidates for investigation. Similarly, cobalt dropped nickel-zinc materials have low, but constant permeabilities, however still an order of magnitude higher than air core; and (2) Capacitor dielectrics with low dipole orientation energy at frequencies in excess of 50 MHz and carried out to identify the most promising materials, e.g., co-polymers which may exhibit the needed properties in the polyacetelynes radical.",455,2883,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66933/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66933/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,88.8 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:49:22,,,,,N88-007_66933,DOD_SBIR_88_P1_C8_N88-007,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:59.228811+00

Another source is from the ship’s own weapons that are detonated by ballistic fragments or by the shock wave of nearby explosions. These weapons might be enclosed in above deck launch containers or within the ship magazines. Aqueous foams will decrease the pressure generated by an explosion.

The technical problem is to develop the capability to detect targets and at the same time to reject background features over the wide range of environmental conditions experienced in a RAM application. Also target detection capability in low contrast and in negative contrast situations due to low emissivity targets must be quantified. Discrimination against various background features must be determined. Of particular interest are: (a) Sun reflections off the (sea) surface or off clouds at both low and high altitude; (b) Cloud images in the sea; (c) Effects of varying surface enissivities resulting from white caps, oil slicks, floating debris, kelp, etc.; and (d) Performance with land cloud backgrounds.

One technique for software reuse is to take an available tested software component which has reasonable general applicability within a limited domain (e.g., track correlation algorithm) and determine the useful ways in which it can be varied to support similar applications. A version of the component is produced with embedded symbols indicating potential variations and the domain or condition associated with the variation (e.g., for ship class XX include SPY radar returns as a reporting source). This version is called the ""archetyped source”. The installation of the archetyped sources as actual source code for a specific application (e.g., ship class XX) is termed ""source code tailoring”.

These techniques involve algorithms that sharpen the boundaries of objects, and increase the contrast between objects and the background. Some techniques also involve pattern recognition routines. The results of this processing are images that appear, from a visual interpretation standpoint, to have been made with a higher resolution system. Experience has shown the value of increasingly higher spatial resolution in acoustical classification of mine sized targets. Several practical factors limit the achievable resolution. Higher resolution generally implies higher frequencies (reducing operating ranges), larger soundhead apertures (configuration impact on platforms) and higher fabrication accuracies (higher cost). If these image enhancement techniques are applicable to acoustic classification, the apparent resolution of existing systems could be improved, and additional options on sonar soundhead and systems design would be available in the future. This effort shall involve the identification and review of pertinent documents from space based remote sensing efforts. This information shall then be assessed as to its applicability to sonar classification of underwater objects.

At present, this task is accomplished by using non-directional sensors such as sonobuoys. The problem is that actual target track and bearing are based upon the information from each of these sonobuoys taken one at a time; thus, the accuracy of these tracks are but gross estimates of actual tracks. The older Cross Correlating Detection and Ranging (CODAR) airborne systems such as the AN/AQA-3/4 used input from two sonobuoys (whose positions were known) which were fed into the system for bearing resolution via cross correlating each with the other. At this time, no such system exists for use. The system to be developed will be a modern version of this older system (circa 1953); which quantified each of the two signals from a pair of sonobuoys whose positions are very well known; cross correlates these two signals and processes the estimated bearings of all targets being detected to the host controller-desk top. After amassing a number of such estimates from yet even greater pairs of sonobuoys within a net – such as a harbor, actual estimates of all targets’ tracks may be either displayed or reported to a larger host for display.

As sonar ranges are extended, the time between transmissions may be tens of minutes. This is problematic since the total energy is constrained which requires very high peak powers during the transmission. Of greater concern is the very slow rate of target information arrival, providing only one target sample per transmission. The use of a continuous frequency modulation (CFM) transmission with modest peak-powers could provide good range and continuous target information flow. This CFM sonar will facilitate low frequency transmissions for long detection ranges. A primary problem with CFM sonars is some method of controlling the receiver so it remains linear or has a high instantaneous dynamic range even when close to the continuous transmissions. Since the anticipated received power from the transmissions far exceeds present receiver technology, this study will address methods of canceling the very powerful transmissions sufficient to allow reception of the very small echoes expected from long ranges. The cancellations are expected to consist of transmission-bucking circuitry and adaptive cancellers. The study will apply these techniques and investigate the degree to which operational equipment can achieve cancellations.

The need exists for a device that can be mounted on Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) and attack class submarines that would accurately measure the thickness of ice and provide a running ice profile display in northern patrol areas.

The goal is to reduce the probability of a detonation/explosion occurring in ships magazines due to fragments either from hostile or identified in considering approaches to developing an insensitive munitions (IM) container include: level of protection required, maximum fragment threat, maximum shock threat, thermal requirements, size, weight and cost constraints. (a) FRAGMENT IMPACT PROTECTION: It is not necessary for the container to stop incoming fragments from impacting the munition. However, fragments perforating the container and impacting the warhead must have their velocity reduced to a much lower level. Currently, it is believed that fragment impact velocities below 6,000fps will not detonate the warhead. Expected fragments will have a real density approximately equivalent to .5 inch steel plate and masses approaching a half pound. Impacts should be assumed to be ""flat” for the first design/model test iterations. For fragment/armor configurations producing impacts of the inner surface of the armor against the warhead skin, the impact velocity should be no more than the same 6,000fps for the first attempts. (b) SHOCK ABSORBTION CAPABILITY: In the SD protection role, the container should, in addition to the level of FI protection described above, not exceed the tentative 6,000fps limit for inner surface impact with the warhead. The donor warhead for design purposes shall be considered a WDU-25/B Tomahawk Warhead, in a similar protective container. For this reason, the armor must be very securely attached to munitions, either via the container if it is sufficiently robust or independently. (c) TEMPERATURE CONSTRAINTS: A protective feature will be required to function during a slow or fast cook-off. In slow cook-offs, the armor materials may not exceed 500o to 600o F at the time of reaction. In fast cook-off the armor materials may be experiencing 1200o to 1500o F or more on the exterior surfaces at the time of weapon reaction. The protection will be required until the energetic material of the warhead is consumed. This requires about ten minutes in fast cook-off after the explosive starts burning.

Main disadvantages of using multiple fields of view is pilot disorientation of targets that sometimes exist when switching from one field of view to another. It is definitely noticeable when the targets are of low contrast and switching over a large focal range. The weight of existing optics represents a large percentage of the total system weight because germanium is almost twice as dense as BK-7 glass and the lens are generally fast in order to maintain high sensitivity. As a result, there is need for lightweight, compact and continuous viewing FLIR systems. Reducing the weight can be done by investigating new materials for the barrel and replacing three fields of view with a zoom lens. With a zoom lens, not only will continuous viewing be available, but the turret used to support multiple fields of view will be eliminated resulting in an additional decrease in weight. The objective of this effort will be to develop a compact infrared zoom lens having a zoom range of at least 5 to 1. Since zoom lenses generally are longer than the equivalent long fixed focal length lenses, part of the feasibility study will be to see how to minimize its length by using latest design techniques.

The approval of the CAIS as a DOD standard, DOD-STD-1838, on 9 October 1986 will certainly encourage its use. So far very few tools have been written for the CAIS that either employs the CAIS or assist the CAIS tool writer. The interest and application of this interface set is likely to increase dramatically in the near future. Thus, there is a need to initiate the development of a number of tools that will support this increased utilization of the CAIS. The functions to be performed by these tools are as follows: (a) Performing Backups and Archiving: Proposed MIL-STD-CAIS and DOD-STD-1838 do not define interfaces that explicitly do back ups and archiving. However, tools that perform these functions may be written using the interfaces provided by the CAIS. These tools need to be developed; (b) Transferring Tools and Their Data Across APSEs: There is the need for the development of interoperability tools for transferring CAIS tools and their data across APSEs; (c) Performing Configuration Management: The CAIS provides a capability to support the development of a configuration management system. The feasibility of developing a configuration management system using CAIS needs to be verified. (d) Providing a Capability for Executing DOD STD-1838 Tools on CAIS Version A: Compatibility packages that provide a capability for executing DOD-STD-1838 tools on CAIS Version A need to be developed. This need arises because of the inclusion of typing, expanded I/O, and other enhancements that are being incorporated into CAIS Version A. These packages would execute on CAIS Version A. Their use would eliminate the need to modify DOD-STD-1838 tools to allow execution on CAIS Version A. (e) Assessing the Efficiency of a CAIS Tool: This analyzer would assess the efficiency of a CAIS tool by examining the CAIS packages, interfaces, and sequences of interfaces used. It would provide a quick way of determining what aspects of the CAIS are used and would suggest CAIS capabilities that are under-used or are not fully exploited. (f) Measuring the Performance of CAIS Implementation: More and more implementations of the CAIS are being developed. There are no tools presently available for determining execution speeds, disk storage and memory used, and other performance characteristics. Soon this capability will be needed. (g) Compilation System Built to DOD-STD-1838: Intermetrics Incorporated has developed a compilation system, including a compiler, linker, loader, program library, and pretty printer, for a subset of Proposed MIL-STD-CAIS.

The architecture level focuses on TLWR compliance. Rigorous mission analysis, force level perspectives, and systems architectures are the end products. The systems engineering level is aimed at programs. The architectures are systems engineered, wherein they are translated into program level guidance across platform and warfare mission areas. Performance specs, controlled interface drawings and test specs are established. The purpose of this task is to seek innovative assistance at the architectural level. The systems architectures address 12 warfare mission areas: Command (communications), C2, Strike Warfare (STW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Mine Warfare (MIW), Electronic Warfare (EW), Special Warfare (SW), Space, and Logistics.

(2) Physical analysis of the current force (e.g., complete understanding of the platforms, systems interdependencies and Battle Force C2 requirements); allocating ROFs to platforms; composing a baseline warfare systems architecture; establishing functional shortfalls of the baseline architecture and adding FYDP programs. (3) Performance examines the architecture vs. TLWR models and war-gaming, and establishes performance shortfalls.

Current testing indicates that after a period of operation, a buildup of contaminates within the laser gas reduces laser output power by altering the laser gas mix and by condensation/deposition on the laser pressure vessel optical windows. This task will propose and experimentally verify the efficacy of various gas processing techniques that might be employed in space to minimize the levels of contaminants within the laser.

Production of tightly sealed optical windows which demonstrate long calendar life is a topic of continuing interest. Concerns exists regarding long-term changes in the crystalline structure of the frits (seals), which may affect cell integrity, as well as the windows themselves, which may affect beam quality of optical output. In addition, migration of frit component materials onto the windows degrades long-life optical damage thresholds. This task will determine the long-life performance of various high temperature frits and optical windows (including, but not limited to fused quartz and sapphire) in an environment which simulates the interior of an operating lead vapor Raman cell.",128,868,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70728/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70728/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,89.9 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:51:06,,,,,N89-034_70728,DOD_SBIR_89_P1_C9_N89-034,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:00.371966+00

A typical example would be where an aircraft that functions as a repeater for a dispersed line-of-sight network suddenly lost. In this case, the network is divided into small isolated networks. These small networks could be reconnected using High Frequency as an inter-network gateway. The issue is to develop protocols which support reconnections that have minimum impact on the users (host computers). The reconnection processes should be transparent to the users.
