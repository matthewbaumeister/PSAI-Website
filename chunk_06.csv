As this quantity increases, there is a probability that the number of errors in the module will increase. Similarity, the ability of one to understand, and therefore to test and maintain the module decreases. The metric also identifies the minimum number of paths that need to be tested in order to assure the software performs in a consistent and reliable fashion. The Complexity Analysis Tool (CAT) is an automated tool, which analyzes the mission critical computer software (MCCS) source code. This tool currently has the capability of analyzing 3 languages and 2 program design languages (PDL’s). As a result, the complexity, data flow diagram, and test paths are generated for each module of the program. Software changes made during the maintenance phase of the life cycle cost up to 30C times the amount of changes made during initial design. Also, a change in any one of the software modules may have a drastic impact upon the performance of other system components. Because of these facts, a need exits to extended the principles of the McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity Metric and CAT to the system and/or requirements level. A quantitative indication Is needed to answer the following questions: · How maintainable is the system · Given various change options, which these will either improve or have the least effect on the maintainability of the module being changed? · What other portions of the program might be affected by changing a particular module? How does this affect the program’s structure? What logical paths of the software must be retested because of the potential effect propagated as a result of one change? · What modules are the most likely to be problematic from a maintenance point of view? · What effects do the proposed changes have upon supporting documentation? The resulting indicator(s) should show the maintenance status of the system as well as indicating high-risk areas.

During the mid-1970’s, scientists at the Harry Diamond Laboratories (HDL) developed second-generation, laminar- flow fluidic components. In the absence of flow noise in the laminar regime, laminar fluidic devices can detect and amplify extremely small pressure and flow signals. The basic building block of second-generation fluidics is the laminar proportional amplifier (LPA). A standard LPA configuration has been in use for many years now at HDL, its geometry is the result of a combination of analytical and experimental investigations. The standard LPA was optimized for use as a differential amplifier; i.e., it operates on those signals applied differentially, in a push pull fashion, to both controls of the LPA. There has been little or no effort to design an LPA specifically for the case where a single control signal is introduced into only one input. As an example, in a fluidic public address system, the acoustic input voice (AC pressure) signal enters one control of a LPA, while the opposite control is intentionally grounded. Proposed program would investigate and develop new LPA configurations that are specifically designed to accept nondifferential AC inputs signals; i.e., an LPA with only one active control port. Such newly designed LPA’s would then be used as the first stage (preamplifier) in a LPA gain block. The rest of the gain block would be made up of standard LPA’s. Initial examination of some very preliminary designs of a concept for the new AC LPA already suggest that a single input LPA would have higher frequency response and better gain that the standard differential LPA. This overall task will require both an iterative parametric study and an analytical study of critical dimensions to identify the optimum geometry. Among the parameters to be investigated are the control nozzle width, the setback of single active control and the splitter distance. Subsequent research would address overall fluidic circuit design techniques to improve dynamic performance (e.g. to obtain a flat, or at least linear response over a specific bandwidth).",362,2305,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70355/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70355/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,87.7 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:23:54,,,,,A87-051_70355,DOD_SBIR_87_P1_C7_A87-051,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:37.737722+00

The objective is to establish or determine each system’s performance limitations or vulnerability when exposed to existing and/or postulated EW threat environments. The EW environments consist of active and passive electronic countermeasures (ECM). EW vulnerability can be reduced by the incorporation of electronic counter-measures (ECCM) into the weapon system to harden it against hostile EW. Electronic support measures (ESM) are an integral part of the total EW picture. ESM is used to detect, locate, and identity systems on a modern battlefield. The Army EW vulnerability assessment (EWVA) program seeks technology advances in the ECM, ECCM and ESM areas as well as innovative techniques in the determination or system EW vulnerability. An innovative technique in EWVA that needs to be addressed is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The application of the AI should be directed toward the structuring of the EWVA data base to support AI computer-aided EWVA’s. This computer-aided EWVA technique will permit the necessary cost control of out-year EWVA programs. EW vulnerability is required for the theoretical, laboratory, and field investigations. In addition, the Army’s EWVA program requires applicable advances in the electromagnetic (EM) technology areas involving the following regions of the EM spectrum: acoustic (A), millimeter wave (mmw), infrared (ir), optical (O), and ultraviolet (UV). The trend is to use three or more of these regions in a weapon system which categorizes the system as having multispectral capabilities. Technological advances that can broadband the ECM, ECCM, and ESM areas are required. A very broad base of scientific knowledge exists in the areas of magnetic fields. However, there are limitations to their applications because of such things as limited detection range capabilities and low field densities, etc. These have limited the uses and applications of magnetic fields for effective CM and ESM use. There is a need to develop magnetic field applications that can be used to complement existing ESM techniques across spectrum. Multispectral sensor technology needs to be developed to permit simultaneous operation across RF, mmw, ir, O, and UV wavelengths. For ECM advancement there are requirements to address advanced passive ECM, Low observables, and smart munitions ECM techniques. The advanced passive ECM techniques are required for Multispectral ECM environments. The tailoring such as missiles, aircraft, ground vehicles, artillery, and high value assets should be addressed. Smart munitions ECM techniques must be as broadband as possible to minimize the costs of applying them to a wide variety of munitions currently undergoing development. ECCM advances required are for electro-optical (EO) devices. These ECCM techniques should be used to reduce the ECM effects of lasers against EO devices. The importance of very fast optical switches/filters that can respond to the variable postulated wavelengths of hostile threats should be stressed. Emphasis should be on ir, television (TV), night sights, UV systems, and the human eye. There is a trend in the development of new weapon systems based on directed energy technology (high power microwave (HPM), high energy laser, particle beams, kinetic energy weapons, etc.). This process requirements for advances in EW techniques to counter their effects/sensors/fire control systems. These sensors include both active and passive systems. The sensors are expected to operate in the microwave through UV regions of the EM spectrum. Advances in EW techniques are required to defeat these sensors to include search acquisition, track discrimination, fire control, and kill assessment. ECCM technology development for hardening against directed energy weapons (DEW) will be required. Near term ECCM technology for protection of U.S. systems against high energy lasers and HPM should be addressed. Far term efforts are required to develop technology for hardening against particle beams. An important area in assessing the EW vulnerability of systems is the ability to perform accurate EW signature measurements across the EM spectrum. Advances are needed in signature measurements that will not only provide comprehensive data with the data with the required accuracy, but will also minimize the time in accomplishing the measurements; i.e., minimize cost.",674,4512,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70370/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70370/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,87.7 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:24:01,,,,,A87-068_70370,DOD_SBIR_87_P1_C7_A87-068,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:37.737722+00

The robotic capability may be a mobility function or be associated with the specific mission the system performs or both. Many of the missions envisioned for military robotic systems required manipulative capabilities e.g., ammunition handling, explosive ordinance disposal, vehicle refueling , are decontamination. As system control evolves from teleoperation to autonomy the human’s role transitions from operator to supervisor (manager). This transitional zone offers many near term opportunities for ford multiplication thru extension of system capabilities, proliferation of unmanned vehicle systems controlled by a single operator training requirements and workloads thru reliance of automated functions. Supervisory controlled systems impose new, frequency unprecented demand on the human supervisor and the displays/controls with which he interacted. The principal focus of this activity is the expansion of the empirical database regarding supervisory control regimes for manipulative function of Army interest. The SBIR activity will enhance an existing research activity, the soldier Robot Interface Project, thru which a mobility manipulator equipped robotics/human factors testbed is being developed by the Human Engineering Laboratory. An important aspect of the interaction with the Soldier Robot Interface Project is the requirement for systems to demonstrate prool of principal for function in the field environment which volume, power and weight constraints have a critical impact on the operational utility of the system. Specific areas of interest within this SBIR topic include: a. A machine world model consistent with human cognition, task is to reduce operator and machine. Workload by enabling high-level communication between operator and machine. World model may require vision or other sensors, and should enable ( or may require) interaction with operator by means of designator, voice input etc. b. Operator perception of the machine, or ""tele-presence” The operator requires remote viewing with depth perception (stereo vision, orthogonal views), and presentation of encoded sensor information (kinesthetic sensor tactile sense, force/torque, etc.) Presentation of machine world model is also desirable. c.

Accordingly, the Army Research Office seeks small business sources for development of innovative research and development efforts for generating ad hoc analysis tools for strongly 3-D flows such as in skewed rotating channels, rotor tips, blade-fuselage juncture, angle-of attack bodies, etc. Of special interest are situations of aerodynamically loaded bodies period moving past attached structures, such as occur in small turbo machinery components or helicopter blade fuselage configurations. Complex and Practical 3-D geometries should be the focus of such work.

Part of the problem stems from the so-called ""brittleness” of an expert system, or a lack of real world knowledge beyond its constrained, narrow domain of expertise. There is a hope, however. Suppose for a moment that two brittle expert systems were to be interfaced with a tool which understands how the two might be related in the context of some larger system. Of course the two expert systems must posses some degree of commonality; for example it would make little sense to conjoin Prospector and Mycin because mineral exploration and infectious disease diagnosis and convincingly different domains. Fortunately, battlefield functional activities don’t have that problem: They depend upon one another. Assume the existence of a token-passing ringing of 12 battlefield expert systems, which are willing to share knowledge across their boundaries, but have not yet been implemented to do so. There are 66 (12 objects taken 2 at a time) possible interfaces among the dozen expert systems when pair wise compared. This number at first glance seems prohibitive, but it compensated by the generally smaller size of the required interface versus the sized of the two individual expert systems being conjoined. Currently, lexicons and closed-world natural language parsers gave been designed and implemented for the following set of functions: infantry, armor, artillery, air defense, engineers, logistics, signals, radio electronic combat, reconnaissance, aviation, and chemical-biological-radiological types of activity. Task: Conceptualize, design and implement the 66 pair wise interfaces among the 12 battlefield functional expert systems. As an example, consider the interface between aviation and engineers. Engineers might clear an airstrip for aircraft during maneuvers: aviation might provide air cover for engineers during a firefight. The aviation-engineers interface would need to contain this kind of knowledge. Bidders must possess tactical battlefield expertise (the government does not have the resources to train anyone); have unlimited access to their own dialect of Lisp (preferably Interlisp, otherwise Common Lisp, Zetalisp, or Franz Lisp); have their own computing facility (due to other commitments, the government cannot provide a computer); have a demonstrable track record in innovative artificial intelligence research focused on natural language; document a talent for not only developing new concepts but also implementing them in Lisp software just short of the advanced development level.

This management process nominally considers a variety of factors to include target nomination and threat, a knowledge of the target operating characteristics, sensor nomination and expected accuracy, sensor vulnerability, possible effects of weather terrain, and the type/types of intelligence information sought. In addition, the collection manager will frequently attempt to merge two or more differing collection plans into a single collection plan which will potentially satisfy all of the intelligence requirements more efficiently. Historically, those paradigms which have been developed to automate this collection management process have been inadequate primarily due to two design deficiencies. First, they have been overly simplistic. They make a series of simplifying assumptions which make the paradigm tractable but result in an uninteresting and insensitive analysis process which is generally considered inaccurate and not unable. Second, they make complex modeling assumptions which are only relevant and factual for a unique set of battlefield conditions. This type of approach (usually an artificial intelligence expert system approach) results in an algorithm which is domain-sensitive and not effective within other dissimilar tactical domains.

In this respect, the differ from the classical crystalline materials that easily produce second-harmonic responses. Since liquids are self healing, they can best be utilized to endure high-intensity laser radiations and suffer less optical damage than solids. The investigation of a large third order susceptibility has been carried out on a few organic and polymeric materials. For X(3) applications in the visible spectrum, Kerr liquids like carbon disulfide have been studied for a long time. Recent ultrafast measurements of CS2 have shown to exhibit two relaxation times, 1.3 ps and 200 fs. Hence, the search for materials with extremely large third-order susceptibility remains to be the most important task now.

For this reason, it becomes essential and a challenge to investigate the problem of ocular protection for military personnel in the battlefield. The practical protection problem is complex and very probably requires a subsystem rather than a simple optical device. Like the human eyes, the protection is generally carried out in several steps. A mechanical shutter that can be completely closed off may be required. But it is important to have an optical device with fast response to protect against the high power irradiation of an incoming laser beam. With high power lasers currently available, the optical device must create of a reduction of incoming laser radiation by several orders of magnitude in order to protect against the eye damage. Consequently, the desirable speed of the response would be in nanoseconds or picoseconds durations. In addition, the initial optical protection has to hold long enough for the next step or the closing of the mechanical shutter. It is clear that a nonlinear optical device is very important in an ocular protection system. In this Phase I study, characteristics of nonlinear optical effects are examined and analyzed for this potential application.

We have found that the basic criteria for such an analysis and the conclusions derived, is the fundamental knowledge of the location relative to its current environmental surroundings which includes not only the terrain features, in the immediate vicinity, but also the methods and conditions of travel, and the apparent relationship to other nearby targets. Most of this knowledge can be obtained a priori through the efficient storage, search and display of geographic maps and motion specific characteristic data relative to specific types of targets (i.e., wheeled, track, helicopter, ect.). In order to achieve the automation desired, natural terrain features, man-made features, and tactical overlays must be stored in the system so as to allow rapid search, analysis, and reporting. Initial work on this subject would define the methods and concepts for implantation of a limited terrain knowledge base which would support added knowledge based processing capability using the methods and concepts of Artificial Intelligence. Using these techniques, the data would then be utilized by the system to produce valid conclusions relative to the classification or identification of particular targets detected by the radar sensor system. One of the conceptual storage and retrieval methods investigated by HDL, and which shows considerable promise, is the so-called ""Quad-Tree” algorithm. This technique partitions two-dimensional surfaces into quadrants, each quadrant into smaller quadrants, and so on until the desired granularity is reached. In this manner, information may be contained in various levels of detail, the search goes only as deep as required by the specifics of the request. In the case of maps, terrain features, target characteristics, ect. this appears to provide the efficiency demanded by real time sensor operations.

There is a growing realization that when targets are immersed in foliage, or screened by foliage, this poses a major challenge to the collection of reconnaissance information. The presence of foliage creates two major difficulties in the observation of military targets 1) the propagation of sensor energy through the foliage, and 2) the discrimination of the targets of interest from the surrounding cultural features. A potential solution to the problem lies in the use of high resolution multi-frequency, multi-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In addition to these parameters, the SAR may also be used interfermetrically to allow another degree of freedom in the discrimination of targets in foliage. Also, the use of longer wavelength radars can penetrate through the vegetation canopy. The electromagnetic (EM) wave interaction that takes place when a target is immersed in foliage may be discriminated by the utilization of high resolution, multi-polarmetric, multi-spectral scattering properties. SAR signatures comparison of images that include these parametric properties may provide the ability to detect and classify these targets. A better understanding of the EM interaction with a metal target in a forested scene calls for the formulation of all possible radar backscattering components. The polarization-sensitive characteristics of the forested scene are accentuated by the presence of the metal object. For example, the SAR signature of a forest and a metal object can be described successfully using radar backscatter from the canopy, the ground and target interaction. The resolution capability of the SAR can also help to reduce the amount of scattering (clutter) from the foliage so it doesn’t compete with the target. Quantitative analysis of the properties of the EM interaction for SAR images of a tactical target in foliage is needed in order to generate a better understanding of the behavior of the detection mechanism of these classes of targets in foliage.",320,2125,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68230/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68230/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,88.8 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:25:58,,,,,A88-044_68230,DOD_SBIR_88_P1_C8_A88-044,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:39.084192+00

Potentially, a single system could recognize many different types of signals. For example, a signal vector whose elements are variable functions of time can be represented as trajectories through hyperspace. An alternate representation is a two-dimensional surface where time is one axis and the feature index is the other. An example of structure that can be represent this way is a spectrogram. The inputs to the neural network are the intensities of corresponding time-frequency matrix elements. A speech-recognition system could be implemented using the sonagram approach. Image recognition may be achieved using the spatial intensity matrix as the input pattern. The same neural network could be used for both functions. A slightly more complex situation involves the use of features from multiple sensors. With appropriate training, a neural network will automatically combine features that are relevant to class separation. In this case, we automatically perform multichannel data fusion. Of particular interest is the application of these techniques to multi-sensor target recognition. In this case, features extracted from several sensors by signal processors are applied to the network. Through training, the network will learn to associate sets of features with particular target types.

Rapid progress is also being made in III-V semiconductor electro-optic technology. The combination of these two maturing III-V semiconductor technologies shows considerable promise in advancing the practical implementation of phased array radar. This will be accomplished by incorporating optical control and coordination of the individual radiating elements in the phased array. The fact that both technologies are based on III-V semiconductors even offers the potential of function integration of optical and microwave tasks on the chip level. The analog modulation of optical signals at microwave frequencies is beginning to be addressed for applications such as optical communications and signal processing, but radar requirements will challenge the state-of-the-art in this area (requirements as high as 100 GHz) for some time to come. By this means a microwave signal can be conveyed on an optical carrier to the radiating apertures. Precise phase shifting of optical signals can be converted into microwave phase shifts, thus relaxing the pressing requirements for high-frequency microwave phase shifters. Also, optical attenuation can shape the power distribution across a microwave array. Critical aspects of this approach are microwave modulation of optical signals (especially at 10 GHz and above), optical phase shifters, optical attenuators, and the recovery of the microwave signal from the optical carrier.

One important component of an EFI fire set for most Army applications is the dc-dc converter for charging an energy storage capacitor. Conventional magnetic components such as a pot-core transformer in a typical square wave or flyback converter configuration add considerable cost and bulk to the dc-dc converter. They are also difficult to package for survival in a high acceleration (30,000g) launch environment. A possibility for reducing the cost and bulk of a dc-dc converter magnetic component is to use printed circuit spiral coils that are laminated into a kapton flexprint assembly with permeable material such a discs of metglass.

For some applications efficiency is not an important consideration. A baseline configuration would be cylindrical with a diameter of 1.3-1.5” and a thickness determined by the number of coil and metglass laminations.

Sub-Surface Flaw Detection in Gear and Bearing Configurations: Immediate sub-surface flaws in gears and rolling element bearings can be potent crack-initiation sites. These flaws are most dangerous when they exist at depths between 0.001 and 0.010 inches below the surface depending on the size of the flaw. The flaws can be exogenous inclusions, precipitates, or even preexisting cracks (which do not intersect the surface). Nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques exist that are capable of detecting these flaws in specific areas, but a cost-effective way is needed to inspect the entire critical surfaces of the gears and bearings.",273,1885,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68262/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68262/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,88.8 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:26:10,,,,,A88-076_68262,DOD_SBIR_88_P1_C8_A88-076,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:39.084192+00

The choice of spectral, spatial, and radiometric sensor parameters will affect the information content of the data and its exploitation potential.

The purpose of this work is to determine if knowledge in the form of IPB, deployment doctrine and force structure analysis can be imposed on the probabilistic relaxation labeling model so that many of the false alarms and ambiguities can be accounted for with confidence. The relaxation model is characterized by a compatibility function RIJ (lambda, lambda’) which controls the effect that the probability attached to label lambda’ at location J makes on lambda at location I during the update process. The relaxation model is also characterized by weights CIJ which reflect contributions on the probability update at location I according to neighborhood location, for example distance between I and J. The analysis will consider N nodes (places where target configuration were detected) and M labels (possible target configurations) at each node. Associated with each label at each node is an estimate of the probability that the label is correct. The Phase I effort will determine if and how ground order-of-battle knowledge can be reflected in the parameters of the relaxation model.

For relieving congested condition at the buffers and the links, various techniques have been proposed, such as the use of special control packets (stop/slowdown and speedup packets from congested node to source node) which is a congestion control technique, the use of sliding windows in the level 2 and level 3 of the layered protocols, which is a flow control technique imbedded in the ISO model, and the use of alternate paths which is an adaptive routing technique. However, the performance and the interaction of these techniques are not well understood. One objective of this task is the following: 1) modeling the congestion control techniques, mathematical models preferred, 2) understanding the interaction and the effect of the sliding window mechanism on traffic flow, 3) development of adaptive routing technique for congestion control, and 4) performance analysis of these techniques.

A few combined routing and flow control strategies/techniques have been proposed for maintaining network conditions so that optimum performance objectives are achieved such as minimum average end-to-end delay, subject to link capacity and buffer constraints.

The implementation of Concurrent Common Lisp sponsors the use of remote evaluation using the Intel IPSC concurrent computer. This effort will require the definition of and implementation of a prototype remote evaluation capability suitable for the smaller PC-based environment. Advanced work will allow the integration of VAX/Sun workstations into the system; however, the focus of this effort will be to extend the power and flexibility of a PC workstation within a networked environment using remote evaluation concepts. The initial implementation should support Common Lisp and Prolog based application programs. Extensions, augmentations, and enhancements to these languages may be required in this effort to support the concept. The desired result of this effort is a package of appropriate tools that allows the application programmer to early implement remote evaluation and remote data types within a PC environment.

The objective is to establish or determine each system’s performance limitations or vulnerability when exposed to existing and/or postulated EW threat environments. The EW environments consist of active and passive electronic countermeasures (ECM). A system’s EW vulnerability can be reduced by the incorporation of electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) into the system to harden it against hostile EW. Electronic support measures (ESM) are an integral part of the total EW picture. ESM are used to detect, locate, and identify systems on a modern battlefield. The Army EW vulnerability assessment (EWVA) program seeks technological advances in ECM, ECCM, and ESM areas as well as innovative techniques that can be applied to the determination of system EW vulnerability. The Army’s EWVA program requires applicable advances in the electromagnetic (EM) technology areas involving the following regions of the EM spectrum: acoustic, millimeter wave (MMW) radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR), through ultraviolet. The trend is to use three or more of these regions in a weapon system which categorizes the advances that can be used in broadband, ECM, ECCM, and ESM techniques are required. Multispectral sensor technology needs to be developed to permit simultaneous operation across RF, MMW, and IR-UV wavelengths. Unique realistic and more efficient approaches in the establishment of the system’s EW vulnerability are required for the theoretical, laboratory and field investigations. A multispectral simulator utilizing automatic target recognition technology is required to assess multisensor systems. The simulator must have the capability to generate scenes with backgrounds, targets and countermeasures in multispectral regions to include millimeter wave for infrared and television wavelengths. Simulation is a powerful tool which can reduce the need for costly EW field investigations. To advance ECM technology, there are requirements to address advanced passive ECM, low observables and smart munitions ECM techniques. The advanced passive ECM techniques are required for multispectral ECM environments. ""Tailoring” for ECM purposes, of the multispectral signatures of military targets such as missiles, aircraft, ground vehicles, artillery, and high-value assets should be addressed. Smart munition ECM techniques must be as broadband as possible to minimize the costs of applying them to a wide variety of munitions currently undergoing development. Electro-optical countermeasures (ECCM) advances are required in both decoy and jammer categories. In the decoy category, both pyrotechnic and pyropheric materials are required that can provide spectrally tailored output to match target signatures. The burn characteristics are required to be temporally adjustable chemical mix or physical design to allow risetime/burntime selection for maximum effectiveness against specified systems. In the jammer category, advances are required in spectrally tailored infrared and ultraviolet sources that can provide higher output radiation power levels with reduced weight, physical size and input power requirements. Jammer modulation techniques advancement to provide programmable waveform shapes as well as CW waveforms from unmodulated constant level output to frequencies as high as 5kHz are required. ECCM technology advances are required for electro-optical (EO) devices. These ECCM techniques should be used to reduce the ECM effects of lasers and RF against EO devices. The importance of very fast optical switches that can respond to the variable postulated laser wavelengths of hostile threat systems should be stressed. The optical switches should respond to very low level intensities. Emphasis should in on IR, television, nightsights, UV systems, and the human eye. EO devices must also be hardened to protect them from degradation of performance and/or damage from RF sources. ECCM technology to protect multispectral sensors is required to prevent RF penetration to sensitive electronics while minimizing the effects on the transmission of desired EO signals. There is a trend in the development of new weapon systems based on directed energy technology (high power microwave (HPM), high energy laser, particle beams, kinetic energy weapons, etc.). This places requirements for advances in EW techniques to counter their effects/sensors/fire control systems. These sensors include both active and passive systems. The sensors are expected to operate in the microwave through UV regions of the EM spectrum. Advances in EW techniques are required to defeat these sensors to include search acquisition, track, discriminations, fire control, and kill assessment. ECCM technology development for hardening against directed energy weapons (DEW) will be required. Near-term ECCM technology for protection of U.S. systems against high energy lasers and HPM should be addressed. Far-term efforts are required to develop technology for hardening against particle beams. An important area in assessing the EW vulnerability of systems is the ability to perform accurate EW signature measurements across the EM spectrum.

Past examples of this thrust are seen in the copperhead projectile currently in production, as well as search-and-destroy armor (SADARM) now in full-scale development. Seekers and sensors in future munitions will be faced with increasingly complex decision making situations, and they must also be producible, affordable, and packageable into existent envelopes of constraint.

At the moment many countries in the world have as standard small decontamination kits some variant of sorbent technology. Fuller’s earth or diatomaceous earth are the most common. The US, however, does not now have a sorbent-based kit. The reasons for that are many. Sorbents have limited capacity, typically 25% by weight or less of liquid chemical agent can be absorbed, and provide no destruction of the agent. As a consequence, the used material is hazardous itself and clean-up of large amounts of liquid requires much material. Thus, sorbents or solids are required that will react with the chemicals they absorb. Ideally this reaction should be catalytic so that little sorbent would be required to destroy the agent; this opens the possibility of materials that could be reused, thereby reducing the logisitic impacts. To be useful the sorption must be fairly fast to pick up the liquid quickly. The reactions could then proceed at a somewhat slower pace if, when they were complete, the surface would be ready to absorb more agent.

The helicopter must therefore achieve an even higher measure of maneuverability and agility in the future. A major limitation affecting both high-speed flight and air-to-air combat is the loss of thrust due to rotor stall. This stall usually occurs on the retreating side of the rotor disc and at high blade angle attack. Conventional helicopters can pull no more than 2.5 g’s during a maneuver, and this is equivalent to an average lift coefficient of 0.75 over the rotor disc. To achieve a 5-g turn would therefore require an average coefficient of 1.5, which is not an unrealistic number provided some type of auxiliary device can be used. While many concepts may appear to have merit, the task of actually implementing any active device on a rotor blade will be especially challenging to the designer. For example, centrifugal forces will have to be an important consideration for a mechanical standpoint. Furthermore, if the candidate device were to be slatted airfoil, the slat would have to be retractable to satisfy the low drag rise requirement on the advancing side during high-speed flight. Innovative ideas are therefore solicited for achieving a high life, stall-free rotor which will in turn enhance the maneuverability and agility of future Army helicopters.

The specific areas that require improvement are the prediction of rotor wakes on advancing rotors and the prediction of the compressible aerodynamic response to the wake-induced inflow. Current wake-prediction methods use integral aerodynamic methods to predict the wake-induced inflow on a rotor and usually model (rather than actually predict) the wake. Current loads data indicate that these models are inaccurate. A requirement exists, therefore, for a wake-prediction method that does correlate with measured loading and preferably that does not rely on empirical wake information. All predictions methods (including integral and CFD methods) will be considered. This wake subsequently produces an azimuthally varying inflow environment in which a rotor must operate. The subsequent response of the rotor to this inflow is strongly Mach-number dependent. Therefore, a requirement also exists for an ability to predict the transonic, unsteady, three-dimensional local flow on the rotor. Methods for including viscous corrections to this local flow are desirable. As especially important feature would be the integration of the various aerodynamic flow methods.

The initial work is being conducted in simulators to provide the experimental control necessary to predict this intelligibility-performance relationship. Subsequent research would be conducted with operational units in the field. Various possibilities for extension of this research are available.

The following research is described for tow platoons of 11 soldiers opposing each other in a hostage situation. Similar research can be designed for attack and for defense maneuvers; here the hostage situation is used as an illustration. Scenario: Whatever scenario is used must be communication- and strategy-intensive to allow us to measure the effects of degrading intelligibility. The hostage situation has three characteristics. The participants are only told the ground rules going in. They do not know the details of the rescue plan. These must be communicated as the progress of the rescue unfolds.

The measures of effectiveness are part-task and whole-task measures. Part-task measures are specific checkpoints in the scenario. (Terrorist appears. How long does it take to kill him?) Whole task measures are survivability and success of the mission. Performance measures are incorrect actions (killing a friendly), correct actions (killing a terrorist), correct strategy (hold fire until I give the signal), speed of response, rating of difficulty (SWAT), and debriefing evaluation of communication intelligibility.

The antenna-amplifier is to be the linear transmitter for small jammer, e.g., RPV, expendables, as well as the basis for forming very high power transmitter from a few modules. It must provide good efficiency for maximum emitted power output. It is desired that distortion products be as low as possible to provide low harmonic content in large transmitters, but must be held to a practical value in order to maintain reasonable efficiency. This work is aimed at simultaneous dramatic improvements in antenna-amplifier power and bandwidth for a given size, which will require a substantial improvement over present capability. Highly imaginative and innovative techniques will probably be required, but must be limited to practical approaches usable for military applications such that further development could produce equipment suitable for operation and maintenance by US Army forces in the field. In jamming systems, requirements for large gains, bandwidths, directivity, and efficiency are often present. When the weight and size of the installation are not of overriding concern, the preferred approach would be to use antennas of sufficient size to ensure that these objectives are met. Such antennas are usually several wavelengths or larger in size, and then typically include conventional dipholes, whips, log periodics, and other types. In many cases, however, such as with small mobile platforms (e.g., jeeps and small RVPS), the available space may be extremely limited. In addition, other limits are sometimes encountered, such as the often critical aerodynamic constraints associated with some RPVS, which do not allow the use of large antennas. ""Electrically small” antennas or antennas that exhibit maximum dimensions less than a half wavelength, are often the only alternative. Unfortunately, electrically small antennas have imposed severe limitations upon the overall efficiencies of these jamming systems, particularly where broadband operation is desired. PHASE I- The feasibility of an antenna integrated with active amplifier circuitry is to be investigated to achieve significantly improved performance. This would be accomplished via design analysis of active circuitry driving the very small radiation resistance directly without the necessity of matching impedances to a common level (normally 50 ohms). The major thrust of this effort is to develop unique approaches to the design of broadband, electrically small antennas, with improved transmitting efficiencies, through the use of active circuitry. That is active circuits are to be used in place of conventional, passive matching networks for improved bandwidth and matching efficiency. In addition to this, the actual antenna structure is to be integrated (attached directly) with the RF amplifier itself so that the two are considered as one entity (with possibilities for improved performance). PHASE II- The contractor shall design, fabricate, test, and evaluate an interim antenna amplifier of each possible candidate type to demonstrate the achievement of 3- to 300- MHz and 1-30-MHz bandwidths using existing low power FETs. The minimum power output should be 100 watts. This design should also demonstrate achieving high radiated efficiency and distortion and spurious products output requirements. Using the output of above, the contractor shall design, fabricated, test, and evaluated a high power design of each type using any available and/or experimental high power transistors, or combination of circuit approaches if only low power devices are available. The minimum RF power output in the fundamental frequency should be 250 watts continuous wave (CW) from 3 to 300 MHz and 500 watts, 1 t0 30 MHz. The design should show achieving the frequency range and any tuning time, efficiency, distortion, and spurious products and be at the smallest possible physical dimensions achievable, limited only by the thermal hotspot temperatures of the components for CW operation. Each candidate shall be evaluated for attainment of all of the performance, physical, and other requirements. The emphasis shall be on achieving high power density (watts per cubic cm, watts per kg).

Examples of such systems include Extended Position and Location Reporting System (EPLRS), the Maneuver Control System (MCS), and communication systems like Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS), and Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE). In addition, computer technology is being used to develop various training devices that will be used in part to train command groups. A prominent example is Simulation Network (SIMNET). Such systems must undergo user testing and evaluation before they are accepted by the Army. This is done to demonstrate that systems meet the Army’s needs. Initially, a system undergoes operational testing (OT) to see how adequately it operates in an operational environment, and sometimes the system is also subjected to Force Development Test and Experimentation (FDT&E) in order to determine the best way to employ the system tactically and operationally. One of the issues frequently addressed during the formal evaluation of a system in the extent to which a given system improves the command and control process. This has traditionally proven to be a rather difficult task to perform, and testers have typically relied on subjective impressions and ratings of commanders and their staff to provide information to address the issue. Objective performance data to address the issue to have seldom been collected. There have been some attempts to develop more objective procedures for evaluating the effectiveness of command and control procedures. Examples include using Army Training and Evaluation Plans (ARTEPs), and the Headquarters Effectiveness Assessment Tool (HEAT). But these methods tend to be cumbersome and very manpower intensive, in addition to being of unknown reliability and validity. There is thus a need for the development of a method for objectively measuring the effectiveness of command and control functions. The method should be applicable to evaluating (C2) functions at battalion, brigade, and division level during user testing and evaluation. Conservation of manpower on site during testing is important. Utilization of computer technology to collect and process objective performance data is highly recommended. It should be noted that this problem is similar to evaluating (C2) during training of command groups, and nay method developed under this program will likely have applicability to evaluating training programs. The unique focus here, however, is on developing measures of (C2) that can be applied during user testing of systems under field conditions that stimulate a combat environment. The work will be accomplished in two phases. The objectives of Phase I will be to (1) develop objective performance measures that can be used to evaluate the C2 effectiveness of command groups in maneuver battalions, maneuver brigades, and divisions, and (2) develop a plan for validating those measures. The deliverable will be a report that reviews previous work in the area, describes the performance measures developed for this effort, the rationale for their selection, and describes the performance measures developed for this effort, the rationale for their selection and development, and a proposed validation plan. The objectives of Phase II will be to (1) validate the performance measures during a field test, (2) refine the measures as a result of the validation effort, and (3) revalidate the measures on another field test.

These methods are being validated with air flow experiments at Rennsalaer Polytechnic Institute. Because this approach is in satisfactory agreement with experiment it appears logical to develop its use for preliminary design. However, flareback conditions can occur at every firing: At projectile exit, muzzle flash can initiate flame travel in the direction of fuel-rich gases within the barrel. The gases expand to ambient, but auto ignition conditions continue at the muzzle. Flame velocity can then exceed the velocity of exiting combustibles, thus permitting the flare to advance into a barrel. This means that a well designed bore evacuator should pump air (and Residual propellant gas) from the breech at speeds that exceed the flame speed plus muzzle head - wind. Otherwise, the nozzle exits can become flame holders. As the discharge cycle subsides, such flame holders can permit flame travel through the nozzle array and combustion of residual gas within the reservoir, possibly weakening and causing subsequent malfunction of the device. Thus, active flareback control is the desired goal: A 3D computer fluid dynamics code that accounts for dissipative gradients and real gas chemistry effects can yield toxic product compositions. Control will be accomplished with parallels coding of flow physics, and animated visualization of the flareback combustion processes. Planned developments include: (1) Construction of a real gas 1D bore evacuator design model to yield propellant gas simulations with compositions at valid equilibrium states. The BLAKE dense gas thermo chemical code is used to obtain initial combustion product compositions. (2) NASA’s dilute-gas code will determine premixed equilibrium combustion of real gas products with entrained air, thus established the dependency of toxic residuals on flareback.",294,1970,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a multidimensional finite element Computational Fluid Dynamics program to defeat flare back by coding for parallel architecture machines: A modular approach can be used, beginning with the simplest model that can capture basic physics within the bore evacuator, viz., asymptotic steady-state, 2D in viscid, real gas flow.

Systems based on the GPS are available which are low cost and small in size. However, such GPS based systems have some fundamental limitations.

The requirement of low cost size/weight if compared to MAPS applies to the “backup” device. The third requirement is to investigate potential techniques for using GPS, or GPS integrated with another device, to obtain orientation of azimuth reference data.

Tracking filters for both fixed and rotary wing aircraft have already been developed that use attitude angles (yaw, pitch, roll) in addition to the usual radar measurements. Computer simulation of tracker performance when tracking violently maneuvering aircraft indicates that a dramatic improvement is obtained by using optically-derived attitude information. It is desired to develop a similar filter for ground vehicles and to test it against real targets, as well as to improve the performance of the aircraft trackers and test them against real targets. The development of an automatic target recognizer that will accurately determine target type and orientation is very important to this topic and may include techniques for global and partial shape recognition of three-dimensional objects by using two-dimensional exterior contour information, or recognition of three-dimensional objects by using three-dimensional surface information, or use of time-varying imagery to segment shape.

The current design results in an unreliable device with inconsistent electrical characteristics and is highly prone to open circuit.,"GENERAL: The current fusible link or micro fuse per dwg. 9328688 is used exclusively in FASCAM mines to permit selection of different self-destruct times. The self-destruct setting circuit is a capacitive discharge type whereby the dispenser provides and electrical pulse into the mines thought a magnetic coupling device. The energy received in the mine is used to fire a micro detonator (to initiate the battery) as well as to blow out micro fuses. Different pulse polarities and amplitudes selectively blow out different fuse combinations, thus providing the e logic to bias an integrated circuit, which gives different self-destruct times. The current device utilizes a simple tungsten bridge wire spot welded across two terminals in a non-hermetically sealed can. The bridge wire is so small (.00013 in dia), that it is difficult to make a consistent, high quality product. The non-hermetic enclosure also allows contaminants to attack the bridge wire and terminals, which leads to changes in the fusing characteristics and often open circuits. As a result these deficiencies, many mines will lose their ability to be properly programmed and will self-destruct early, thus significantly reducing minefield effectiveness. The mechanism by which the fuse responds to the capacitive discharge pulse and eventually opens has been studied extensively. Prediction of fuse response based on non-destructive testing has also been attempted. Both efforts have had limited success. It appears that discharge pulse produces second and third order effects, which are significant and highly dependent on device construction. Testing has shown that the device characteristics are affected significantly by weld integrity, bridge wire thickness, and bridge wire type. These efforts further confirm the need for a consistent high quality device.",276,1834,1,No,No,No,,Test the current fusibility link and develop a new specification for the devices performance based on capacitive discharge excitation.

This will include addressing the issue of an Ada compilation system and a distributed runtime environment that will effect the distribution of a program through an integrated process without manual modification of code.,"GENERAL: In order to obtain the performance needed for Ada hard real-time embedded software systems it is often necessary to distribute a program so it runs on an network of loosely coupled microprocessors. The Ada language provides a tasking model that can be used as a single model concurrency if distributed rendezvous can be supported across multiple processors. There is currently no simple method defined to accomplish the development, testing, and execution of distributed Ada programs. Software developed for distributed systems often involves manual preprocessing of source code or post processing of object code in order to direct the distribution. There are no provisions for, among other things, dynamic task migration between processor, transparent network debugging support with synchronous halting of all processors and system clocks, analysis of behavior that could predict overload conditions, analysis of tradeoffs involved when network interface standards are imposed that affect real-time response requirements, allowing for standard fault tolerance techniques, and testing that time requirements are being met any the software running on multiple processors.

During the past few years the transistors have increased in capability where, in order to use their full CW rating, dissipation of 400-1400 watts per device is mandatory. Other circuit elements, such as ferrite-loaded inductors used are HF/VHF impedance transformers, capacitors, and switches in harmonic filters are also required to be cooled by water-cooled heat sinks. This immediately limits that application of high transmitter powers to large vehicles, which can carry the heat sink weight (which is eight or more times the circuit component weight) and the coolant, coolant pumps and radiator weight. The heat sinks are also very large compared to the devices and circuits that they are cooling. The thermal packaging design is to maximize device power handling capability, be productive, reduce weight and volume of the supporting cooling system, preferably ambient air, and increase reliability by reducing junction temperatures of the transistor, particularly under typical CW and 2:1 VSWR operations. Previous efforts have used copper in place of aluminum as the heat sink, liquid cooling of the top of the die or other component, and very large heat pipes. Copper as the basic heat sinks its too heavy. The liquid cooling of the die, while successful in some applications, adds the coolant weight, the weight of the second coolant container die, while successful in some applications, and the coolant weight, the weight of the second coolant container on the circuit card and potential orientation problems if the coolant is not deep enough to cover the die continuously. When ferrite components are to be cooled, then this second coolant container becomes very large. Large heat pipes in the heat sink have increased, not decreased the size of the heat sink. The use of micro-heat pipes or a flat heat pipe with laminar flow embedded into the heat sink has a potential of three to four orders of magnitude better heat conductivity than aluminum. There are other potential cooling approaches such as thermoelectric devices coupled to a heat sink or combination of approaches.

The device must be capable of moving particles from one chamber to another for different types of experiments and adding chemical as needed for analyzing the particle.,"GENERAL: In recent years the use of various types of suspension chambers has led to the development of optical means of analyzing the content of particles including both solvents and soutes. The particles analyzed are in the one-micron to thirty-micron size range. The use of fluorescence, infrared, and Raman spectroscopy has been shown to allow analysis of the contents of liquid droplets in the size range. The use of optical resonance in the mile scattering can enhance the sensitivity of these spectroscopic techniques and provide high-resolution volumetric analysis. Electrodynamic suspension in the chamber can provide gravimetric analysis. A device is needed where several of the above methodologies can be performed sequentially on the same single micron-sized particle. It is desirable to develop means of sequentially moving single particles non-destructively from one chamber to another so that after the first type of optical analysis, a second type of experiment may be performed on the same particle including adding various test chemicals also in micron-sized amounts to identify the contents of the original particle. These tests should be capable of being performed at temperature controllable to +/-0.1 degrees Celsius at know pressure, in controlled humidity and with known atmospheres of surrounding gases. Further one should be able to automatically monitor changes in mass of the unknown particle as it absorbs gas, evaporates or has test chemical added to it. The means for adding carefully monitored micron-sized amounts of test chemical to a suspended particle must be provided and demonstrated. Finally, since it has been shown that mass spectrometry of the chemicals making up a single particle is of use in identifying the particles, the same particle should be able to be delivered for analysis in such a device after all the other tests have been carried out. One should alternatively have the option of saving the particle for microscopy.",307,1970,1,No,No,No,,Experiments to determine which of the above methodologies may be achieved in a single device as well as theoretical analyses to show which combination of methods yields the best information regarding the nature of an unknown particle studied.,"Construction of a pilot model of a device utilizing several of the analysis methods.

A concept for a system utilizing hot air to accelerate the evaporation of the agents was carried into development a few years ago but the effort was halted when it became apparent that the process would be too slow to be operationally feasible.

The airborne dust concentrations around military vehicles undergoing test can vary form milligram levels to levels exceeding 20 gm/m3 with some particle sixes exceeding 100 microns. The average particle size can vary by nearly a factor of 10 between areas of high dust concentration and low concentration. This requires that the system has the capability of compensating for average particle-size change An in-situ measurement is required because the large variance in particle size and the indeterminate flow velocities can cause large sampling errors. A small sensing unit is required to reduce disturbance to the measured airstreams and to allow more freedom in the placement of the sensor. A small sensing unit connects by a flexible umbilical to a larger control unit would be an acceptable concept. It is anticipated that some form of nephelometry could take advantage of the particle-size vs. wavelength response characteristics by using two or more widely disparate wavelengths such as 10.6 micron and visible/near-infrared to give varied weight to large/small particles. The relative response from the two nephelometers would be used to compute the particle-size compensation factor.

The targets consist of sub munitions and the remnants of the artillery projectile from which the sub munitions were expelled. Modified Hawk air defense system radar can satisfactorily track the projectile up to the point at which the sub munitions separate from the shell. It is necessary, however, to track each sub munitions in order to provide real-time pointing data to optical instruments. The Hawk radar is continuous wave (CW) type that provides a Doppler frequency that is a function of the target velocity relative to the radar. Position can only be inferred by integrating the velocity over time from the know location of the gun muzzle. A pulse –Doppler radar could be used to track the projectile, but it is likely that several sub munitions would fall into the range gate and, thus, would not be distinguishable from one another. It has been suggested that the CW Hawk radar be used to illuminate the region that contains the targets. Several passive receivers would pick up the returns from the targets. The emitted signal from the Hawk would also be used by the passive receivers a reference frequency to determine the Doppler shift for each target targets relative to the receivers might then be computed by performing a Fourier transform of the complex return to extract the frequently associated with each target. The relative velocities of the targets should then be used to resolve the target positions.",261,1564,1,No,No,No,,"The proposals will be evaluated considering the depths of analyses for phase I in the areas of energy balance, physical layout, transmission, and mixing of the reference frequency, spectral analysis, velocity computations, correlation for velocities with targets, computation times, processing hardware required, and radar design.

The motion dynamics exhibited by the many different types of objects tracked at test ranges varies greatly. Such objects include slow moving ground vehicles, helicopters, supersonic aircraft, 20 mm. Cannon bullets, high-speed missile and orbital vehicles. The types of tracking instruments utilized varies greatly also and includes optical (both film and video) tracking systems, and millimeter wave and microwave radars. Data rates available from these tracking systems can vary form 60 to 15000 samples per second. Digital filters are used for processing data in both real time and posttest applications. Polynomial process model are typically used to solve this wide range of problems requiring digital filtering primarily because these models can be used over a wide range applications, are relatively easy to apply, and are reasonably robust. While these filters function reliably, their performance is inferior to the use of other more accurate process models. The polynomial filters frequently introduce significant lag when the bandwidth is narrowed sufficiently to achieve adequate noise rejection performance. This attribute is potentially hazardous when such filters are used for in-flight safety calculations on high performance missiles. The use of a set of differential equations of motion, for the object being tracked, as a process model has been shown to produce superior performance has been achieved at the expense of using a much more complex algorithm that is tailored to a specific target. The process of developing such models has proved to be lengthy and labor intensive. These problems limit the potential for applying them to data collected from a wide range of targets. The need is to develop algorithms; techniques and hardware that take advantage of the performance available from the differential equation process modeled digital filters, while retaining the robustness and ease of operation that is characteristic of using the polynomial process models. A user-friendly system, which permits easy development of differential equation process modeled filters, that can be easily adapted to a wide variety of targets, is envisioned.

While the evolved gases play a small role in the interaction of the HPL with the plume, the major interference derives from the HPL scattering by the solid particles. While it is true that optical density (OD) measurements may be made without imaging the particulates, such imaging will allow information to be extracted from the plume, which will shed light on the following: a. The physics occurring at the laser/target interaction monolayer. b. The nature of the chemical pyrolysis of the target. c. The ""structuring” of the plume according to particulate size. d. The cross section for HPL laser interaction with the particulates, when used with OD measurements e. A direct comparison with post-plume particle gathering to help determine post-plume oxidation conditions and the efficacy of the downstream particle gathering experiments themselves. Deep Field holographic imaging will allow the experimenter to focus into the plume, layer by layer, and thus to view the plume in slices for detailed examination.

The device should e hand-portable and capable of being used on a test range. Accuracy required is generally + or – 1 millimeter. There are complicating factors, which must be considered. First, there is generally some penetrator left in the hole. Consequently, a direct measurement is not always possible. Some of the penetrator material is classified as hazardous; drilling through it may not be feasible. The plates are not always flat after testing. Use of ultrasonic devices, as has been suggested in the past, might be difficult. Currently, the steel plates must be torched and cut with a band saw to provide an accurate measurement of holds depths. X –ray facilities are also used to provide quick answers; however, this method is not as accurate as desired. There is a continual backlog of stored target plates awaiting measurement.

This problem is complicated by the possibility of multiple fin sets, irregular fin geometries with crude aerodynamic shapes, and large attack angles. Additionally, fin deflection can cause a significant gap between the inner fin edge and the body surface; at supersonic speeds this gap can cause substantial interference effects and reduce the fin effectiveness, possibly due to shock wave formation within the gap and the interaction of these shock waves to include separation on the body.

Accelerated stress tests are usually performed to determine EA, which is ten used to extrapolate to equipment use conditions. With today’s ultra clean process, assembly and packing environments, doubt is raised regarding the validity of a chemical reaction at the temperatures anticipated for system operation.

The object of the project is to improve the accuracy of measuring wide band transient electromagnetic responses by using optical interferometer sensors which do not disturb the fields being measured.,"GENERAL: The accuracy of measuring wide band transient electromagnetic responses can be enhanced by using nonmetallic sensors which do not disturb the fields being measured. Sensors utilizing a waveguide Mach-Zehnder interferometer approach this desired dielectric sensor; however, they still require metallic contacts and antennas. The operation of these devices is based on the electro-optic characteristics of the crystal material used in the interferometer. A laser beam is divided into two channels within the interferometer. Metallic electrodes are then positioned at the appropriate locations on the waveguide channels so that when a voltage is applied to the contacts, the voltage across the two channels have opposite polarities. The resulting change in the index of refraction of the crystal delays the light in one channel with respect to the light in the adjacent channel, resulting in a net phase shift. When the light is recombined, a change in light intensity results due to the intensity results due to the interference of the two light waves. The interferometer can be operated such that the light intensity is proportional to the voltage across the crystal. The required electrodes and antennas, although very small, perturb the fields being measured and create frequency limitations due to their interactions with the electromagnetic fields.",206,1360,1,No,No,No,,Consists of investigating the possibility of creating and interferometer with the crystal material of the two waveguide channels oppositely poled.

Analyses and/or experimentation will be required to determine the feasibility of manufacturing such a device and its capability to perform to the required specifications. Emphasis may also be placed on miniaturization. The feasibility of calibrators should be addressed.

In addition, transducer power limitations impose restrictions on the usable dynamic range of BAW AO devices. Development in either or bother SAW and BAW AO devices will increase the speed and processing gain of optical processing system. Acoustic-Optic SAW devices use a surface acoustic wave (SAW) to interact signals with an optical beam passing through the crystal. Generally, these devices are constructed using photolithographically produced interdigital finger transducers to excite an acoustic mode which is closely confined to the crystal surface; however, there have been other mechanisms used to create the SAW. An advantage afforded by the SAW AO device design is that multiple transducers may be laid on the surface of the crystal, the number of which is limited only by crystal ""real estate,” and crosstalk among the SAW’s. BAW devices have been used extensively in the development of AO signal processors where high speed and high processing gain are required. The requirements on these devices are that they must have a large spurious free dynamic range and large signal bandwidths. In order to operate in a spurious free region, the input power to the device must be at lower power levels. This puts a limitation on the dynamic range of the AO system unless methods are developed which will increase the efficiency of the BAW devices.

Thus improvements in processing through the use of automation is one possible path to making composite processes more efficient, and hence cost effective. Effective automation in complicated process requires instantaneous interpretation of feedback from a multitude of sensors. However, currently available pressure and temperature sensors are often too bulky to use in certain composites processes such as pultrusion and resin transfer molding. A miniaturized sensor developed for measuring these critical process parameters could be integrated with an expert system to monitor and control a variety of composite manufacturing processes. The sensor would provide, in real time, critical temperature and pressure information, and an efficient control algorithm would anticipate and respond to future processing events. Suck a sensor should produce a signal that is interpretable and reliable at all times during the processing phase, including severe pressure/temperature environments. The thickness of such a sensor should be less than 0.1 mm to allow for easy insertion into areas that would otherwise be inaccessible. In situ sensors could be used for monitoring of wear, corrosion or other degrading mechanisms during service life.",204,1421,1,No,No,No,,Investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of developing a rugged miniaturized sensor to measure critical process parameters in real time for efficient process control during manufacturing of organic matrix composites.,"Optimize and develop a prototype of the sensor demonstrated in Phase I along with any necessary auxiliary equipment and software.

In particular, the processing variables need to be defined, i.e. percent binder, binder composition, debindering temperature and time, and sintering temperature and time.

It must capture all the essential details of the complete viscous flow field, including the trip vortex, the vortex wake, and the stalled for in the centrifugal field of the retreating blade, The numerical procedure must allow for complex tip geometries and innovative airfoil sections to be studied as a means of modifying and improving the stall behavior helicopter blades.",195,1368,1,No,No,No,,"Two principal results should be achieved during the Phase I study.

Since such instruments provide a measure of the icing rate only on surface that totally or nearly ice-free, they do not provide a measure of total natural ice load accumulated through several storms or throughout a season not do they indicate how long ice naturally resides on a surface (ice persistence). Equipment is required that will reliably, automatically, and continuously measure and record atmospheric or sea spray ice load magnitudes with time on surface under natural of laboratory conditions. The instrumentation should be omni directional, and should measure rime, sea spray ice, or freezing rain without bias when it originates form any compass direction or slant angle form the horizon to the zenith. The probe or sensing element should be interchangeable to allow different shapes or surface materials to be tested. The instrumentation should measure accurately during extremes of temperature (+25 to –40 C) and have additional design goals for a compact, inexpensive, lightweight (backpack able) unit that has a high ice collection efficiency in a natural range of droplet sizes form a minimum of 5 microns and wind speeds to a maximum of 80 meters/second. These units should operate reliably in remote locations from a self-contained power supply for up to 8 months. Ice mass should be measured to a resolution of 0.1 g/cm2 of accretion surface. Measurements should be recorded in digital form at 15 minute intervals or less and should be unaffected by snowfall and by motion such as a ship’s movement. This equipment is intended for long-term measurements of ice loads on small structural elements of different shapes and orientation. Electrical transmission cables, structural steel components, antenna elements, or tree branches might be mounted on the sensing unit. An additional desirable feature would be the ability to measure ice density or thickness.

Measurement is also essential for evaluating new weapons systems, tactics, and organizational designs. Measurement needs to address all levels from squad through battalion task force. The Army traditionally has used mission/task analysis to establish the attributes of performance, which should be trained and evaluated. While useful, by its very nature the analytic approach leads to emphasis of ""fractional” parts of performance and often fails to capture the dynamic, emergent, interactive and tightly coupled aspects of unit performance. Additional approaches are needed which emphasize synthesis and more integrated, molar performance indices. The natural of such molar indices any be suggested by the high level constructs contained in, for example, ""combat fundamental”, ""tenets of the air land battle”, etc., described in military history and doctrine.

The most obvious incompatibility is that the Ada concurrency (tasking) can not be implemented efficiently using the standard UNIX concurrency (process) primitives. This forces implementations to use a single UNIX process to contain all of the tasks in an Ada program. The result is that nay system service which suspends an Ada task, also suspends the entire program, effectively negating the desired goal of concurrency. Other problems have been noted, such as difficulty using Ada address clauses, interrupt entries, and accurate timing services. These features are absolutely critical for proper execution of real-time programs. These limitations of UNIX have no caused serious concern in the past because UNIX was considered only for use as a software development environment. This has now changed with the availability of real-time implementations of UNIX that are designed to support embedded control applications. These implementations achieve response times and support for priorities that allow real-time developers the ability to use UNIX as a target environment. Phase I: The Phase I of this project will attempt to resolve the incompatibilities between Ada and UNIX for real-time use. Specifically, an implementation of an Ada runtime that provides real-time support features will be designed for an appropriate real-time UNIX system or POSIX extension. Phase II: The Phase II effort will produce an initial version of the real-time Ada runtime for execution on UNIX and begin preliminary (beta) application testing of the runtime.

The detection should be an automatic process implemented after the hermetic coating process and prior to spooling on the draw tower take up reel.,"The hermetic coating of optical fiber prevents the degradation of fiber performance when the fiber is exposed to harsh environmental conditions. The coatings not only preserve the pristine strength of the glass but also act as a barrier to hydrogen and hydroxyl ions that can optically degrade the performance of the fiber over time. In fiber optic systems where continued high performance is required over a range of difficult operating conditions, these coatings can be invaluable. Identifying pinholes in these coatings is an important step in improving the production process of these fibers. In Phase I a thorough investigation of state-of-the-art detection methods should be made. The investigation should include some type of standard by which the effectiveness of pinhole detection methods can be evaluated. Size of the pinhole, location of the pinhole, and percentage of pinholes detected should be included in this standard. Deficiencies in present pinhole detection methods should be identified and a plan for improvement should be formulated. This plan should include an implementations scheme that describes how the hardware/process will be integrated into a draw tower. In Phase II the plan formulated in Phase I will be executed.

The Department of Defense (DoD) mandate for the use of Ada endorses the concept of software reuse. Several factors, including non-technical factors, have contributed to the current situation where software reuse has not lived up to the expectations of the DOD. A significant problem when trying to reuse previously developed software assets is the selection of the best asset for the intended application. Current library tools focus on the insertion of components into the library and the identification of components that could meet the requirements of a new application. The objective of this proposal is to develop automated tools which will assist the reuser in the evaluation of assets provided by the search of a reuse database. The asset may be anything form the software development process, from a requirement to a piece of Ada code. Given the nature of software reuse, this is rarely an objective process, but one which increases the confidence of the users choise. This proposal tool will enhance the evaluation process and increase the confidence of the user that the best available asset was selected. Since the time required to select the reusable assets directly affects the cost saved by reuse, automated tools are required to quickly assist the reuser in the selection process. Phase I: This is the concept validation phase. The result of Phase I will be the development of an approach for determining the usability of software assets and a description or specification of a proposed tool.

While digital signal processors have high accuracy and flexibility, they are also expensive in terms of size, weight and power. Recent advances in Acoustic Charge Transport (ACT) technology have shown considerable promise for low power military applications. ACT devices combine SAW technology and CCD technology and therefore exhibit similar characteristics to today’s compressive receivers. They are fabricated with GaAs material, however, and therefore analog and digital circuitry can be combined on the same chip. Since the input/output circuitry causes much of the power consumption in digital circuits and also because ACT devices are inherently low power, the potential for substantially reduced power requirements exist. This also brings the benefit of higher reliability due to reduced component count. This effort shall investigate the creation and/or improvement of ACT devices to handle certain receiver functions such as signal compression, detection, correlation, programmable delay line, filtering and frequency dehopping to name a few. The reductions in size, weight, and prime power should break new ground as the Army moves toward common modules for ground, air, and UAV applications.

The proposed ICV will consist of a wafer of material (approximately 4cm X 4cm X .1cm) which exhibits anisotropic thermal expansion across its surface. The thermal expansion between 300 degrees K and 80 degrees K along one direction on the surface of the water must match silicon (-2.3E-4). Along the perpendicular direction on the surface the thermal expansion must match HgCdTe(-9.2E-4). These thermal expansion properties can be achieved by either of two methods. The first method requires finding a material whose thermal expansion matches Si along one direction in the boule and matches HgCdTe in a perpendicular direction. A wafer would then be cut in the plane of the two axes. The second method requires finding a material with thermal expansion greater than silicon in one direction and less than HgCdTe in the perpendicular direction. For this second method a wafer would be cut at the appropriate angle on the boule which would result in the desired thermal expansion across the surface. Graphite, tellurium, and boron nitride are possible materials. There are no known sources for single crystal tellurium or boron nitride.

Factors which contribute to this expense are that many of the systems currently being maintained were written in assembly language or Fortran, and were not designed using modern software engineering principles or practices. These systems were also documented using standards which were in effect at the time of their conception. Additionally, during maintenance, enhancements to the software is often required due to the system’s evolution over its lifetime. The existence of tools, methods, and techniques for quickly and efficiently reengineering these systems (i.e., producing software engineered versions in Ada) would permit these existing systems to continue to be used, evolved and maintained in a cost engineered version in Ada) would permit these existing systems to continue to be used, evolved and maintained in a cost effective manner. Unfortunately, existing tools and techniques that purport to ""reverse engineer” existing software, more often than not produce an Ada version of the Fortran or assembly language code, without reengineering or structuring the software in a software engineering sense. This results in ""Adatran” code that has the appearance of Ada, but the structure and problems of Fortran code. The ability to overcome this barrier and to be capable to determining the functional and behavioral characteristics of existing software is essential to the success of quality Software Reengineering CASE Tools. The objective of this effort is to develop tools, methodologies and techniques to assist in determining the functional and behavioral characteristics of existing tactical software systems for the purpose of reengineering these systems to enable them to be continually refined and improved.

The output will be real time tuning commands to an adaptive channelizer.,"Modern ESM/ELINT receivers must utilize a wide instantaneous bandwidth to intercept modern radars. The present technology for obtaining the instantaneous spectrum over the IF passband consists of SAW dispersive delay lines, Bragg cells, and digital fast Fourier transforms. Programmable filters utilizing acoustic charge transport (ACT) technology exist. If a channelizer is constructed of such programmable filters, it is possible to optimally tune each filter to a signal of interest in the passband, thus overcoming many of the problems with fixed bandwidth/center frequency channels. A means is desired to extract the bandwidth/center frequency of each signal present in the wide instantaneous bandwidth in real time. This data is then to be processed to determine the signals of interest, passed to the receiver signal processor, and used to tune a set of programmable filters to process suitable delayed signals. These signals will typically consist of pulses with durations of 50 nsec to CW, bandwidths from a few hertz to spread spectrum covering several hundred megahertz, and center frequencies which can lie anywhere in the passband. Several pulses from different emitters can be present simultaneously and overlap in frequency. The equipment developed will be integrated and tested with the MEDFLI testbed under actual field test conditions. This technology will subsequently be transitioned into the next generation of ELINT/ESM receivers for the 2000-2010 timeframe. Phase I: Theoretical analysis addressing the limitations of the proposed technique in terms of: Sensitivity; number of simultaneous pulses; timing analysis including the processing time required to generate/implement the required tuning commands and their duration, signal delay required, and any systematic ""dead time” before a new signal could be detected; effectivity analysis in terms of signal density and characteristics which would degrade performance. This should result in a computer simulation which demonstrates the basic feasibility of the proposed approach by generating the appropriate tuning commands from a given input spectrum, and incorporates the theoretical analysis equations/results so that the computer program can be utilized as a design tool for the implementation with specific hardware in Phase II. Phase II: Implement the proposed technique in an IF processor which is interfaceable with the MEDFLI testbed. Three wideband IF signal channels who phase relationships determines the angle of arrival are provided as an input. The digital output format to the MEDFLI processor is specified and consists of a pulse descriptor word for each pulse received (time of arrival, angel of arrival, frequency, modulation, pulse width, amplitude). Depending on the proposed approach and available hardware, either existing hardware may be modified, or a plug compatible IF processor developed. The system will be tested on simulator, installed on a ground based version of MEDFLI, and later flown on an airborne MEDFLI under actual field test conditions.

Also, proof of enhanced stability and reactivity of immobilized biologies is required.","The need for detection of threat agents from environmental samples has prompted the use and evaluation of immobilized antibodies for capture and characterization of toxins, bacteria, and bacterial products. Unfortunately, the ideal method for immobilization with retention of biologic activity has not yet been established. Chemicals currently used, such as silane compounds, glutaraldehyde, and other cross-linking agents, exhibit stable immobilization properties but result in a low percentage of reactive antibodies. Sensitivity of detection of very small amounts of biomass is a critical element of pathogen detection from environmental samples. Therefore, optimal reactivity is essential. Recently, a naturally synthesized polysaccharide from marine bacteria showed adhesive properties strong enough to withstand underwater ocean currents. The successful use of naturally occurring adhesives for immobilization of antibodies could improve sensitivity compared to existing methods for surface capture of threat agents. Phase I: Demonstrate the use of naturally occurring adhesive substances as immobilization agents for antibodies. Further show that more biologic reactivity is preserved by these adhesives, resulting in high sensitivity of detection, when compared to existing methods.

The use of low cost infrared transmitting materials would greatly improve the feasibility of lightweight FTIR chemical agent detectors.,"The U.S. Army Chemical Research, Development and Engineering Center (CRDEC) has recently been engaged in an extensive in-house research program to improve passive infrared chemical detection technology. This research program has focused on developing new infrared technologies to allow for the construction of small, low cost sensors to detect chemical vapors from moving platforms. During the previous two years the research program has made significant advancements in the areas of digital signal processors, digital signal processing algorithms, sampling hardware and optomechanical designs. The recent advancements have the potential of greatly reducing instrument costs over currently available infrared chemical detector devices. However, a significant problem remains in that the currently used optics (ZnSe and Germanium) are a significant cost (approximately $6,000 per beamsplitter) of an infrared chemical detection system. Recently, several low cost materials have been developed for use in the mid-infrared spectral region (8 to 12 microns). One of these materials is an amorphous glass composed of equal mixtures of Selenium, Arsenic, and Germanium. The properties of this material appear to offer the potential of replacement of the ZnSe optics; however, optical window components have never been constructed of this material for applications involving infrared interferometers. Another candidate infrared transmitting material is a blend of acrylic and polycarbonate polymers. It is known that an infrared bandpass filter was made of this material. Phase I: The desired result of this investigation would be to review the technology and select a material for application to FTIR chemical detection. The contractor would specifically evaluate the transmission properties, hardness factors, tolerance to chemicals, and the range of dielectric optical coatings that can be used (e.g. Thorium Fluoride).

These applications vary from aircraft engines to large power generating equipment. The basic principle is to monitor a systems performance characteristics against known or expected performance data. As the system information deviates from this expected performance criteria, an accurate prediction of impending failure can be made. By monitoring the system, these failure predictions can be used to enable corrective maintenance action to take place prior to catastrophic failure of the system. By avoiding catastrophic failure, you avoid secondary damage and over stressing other parts in the system which have greater impact on the system than the primary failure mode. Systems characteristics which have proven useful as monitoring parameters included such parameters as temperature, pressure, vibrations, stress/strain and acoustical signature. By monitoring one or more of these parameters throughout the duty cycle, they can be used in a predictive manner to prevent a catastrophic condition which would cause loss of mission capabilities of the system. It has been shown in the past that rotating machinery has unique characteristics of vibration and acoustical noise which have proven to be excellent candidates for an on vehicle systems monitoring tool. This SBIR proposes the development of an on-board final drive monitoring system which will monitor the final drives to prevent catastrophic failure of same. This system must be rugged enough to survive in a combat vehicle environment and have a mean-time-between-failure higher than the final drive system. The monitoring system is to include the latest technology in sensors, instrumentation, artificial intelligence and expert system technology in the design criteria. Phase I: - Selection of best parameters to monitor to predict final drive failures. - Build a prototype system to monitor final drive performance. - Test the prototype monitoring system in vehicle to substantiate its predictive performance. Phase II: - To field harden the prototype final drive monitoring system design to adapt the design across a range of combat vehicles. - Review all current final drive designs to asses the adaptability of each design to a ""standard” monitoring system design package - Redesign the prototype design to field harden the system. - Install hardened units on vehicles operational at training sites to assess their durability. - Successful completion of this SBIR project will stimulate technical innovation in the private sector.",393,2614,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67503/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67503/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:29:31,,,,,A90-286_67503,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C2_A90-286,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:42.053262+00

This method should not use optical techniques or use the Sun as a reference nor depend upon location of firing or direction of fire.,"The in-flight measurement of the yaw and spin motion of artillery shell has, for many years, been accomplished with the use of optical sensing techniques and standard radio-frequency (RF) telemetry techniques. This is called a yawsonde and uses optical sensors to sense the passage of the Sun as the projectile spins. Pulses from the sensors are telemetered to a ground receiving station using a standard frequency modulation (FM) telemetry system on the projectile. The current yawsonde system, while very successful, can only be used under certain conditions. The sky has to be clear, and since the system depends upon having the sun as a reference, there is a ""window in time” in which the yawsonde can operate, depending upon direction of fire, quadrant elevation and ephemeris data. This window can be quite narrow and can be restrictive at times. What is desired is a system of measuring the yaw and spin motions of artillery shell in free flight. This system should not use the sun as a reference nor be contained by local weather conditions or depend upon firing conditions. Components mounted in the projectile have to survive a launch accelerations up to 60,000 G’s. The system should have the same range and accuracy of operation as the current yawsonde and be able to be packaged in a configuration of typical nose fuze for artillery shell or smaller. Possible candidates for sensing the motion would be single or multiple axis accelerometer or perhaps a system that involves the measurement of phase between sharp nulls in a radiation pattern.

When the projectile passes through the box, some reference structure on the projectile (a projectile fin, for instance) leaves it mark on the cardboard. The sheets are separated by a short distance so that when the projectile traverses the spin box, the references is not lost, e.g. the fin of the projectile does not rotate enough to be confused with its neighbor. In this way, projectile spin can be measured. This is a time consuming process: the box must be prepared for each firing; each piece of cardboard must be ""read” by a person; the data transferred by hand. These disadvantages are significant. An optical technique is desired to replace this very awkward system. The optical technique has the advantage of being non-intrusive. It requires no lengthy set-up. It has the ability to be connected directly to a data acquisition device that ""reads” the data and transfers them electronically. The system might be a series of short duration, high energy pulses of light to obtain data in two-dimensional slices. The pulses of light can be obtained from either a laser or a series of high energy flash tubes. Another approach might be to use a laser to track an intentional anomaly on the projectile. Interrogation of the resulting images might require high speed (possibly parallel) computing and the associated image processing hardware and software. Another technique may be to use an on-board measurement system and to telemeter the information back to a ground station. This would be a direct spin-off of the system that would be used for guidance and control. The detection and triggering system should also rely on optical techniques. It has a specific application in spark ranges that produce shadowgraphs of projectiles in free flight from which time and position can be measured accurately. Large caliber tape; the projectile is detected by breaking the light sheet between the two. Triggering comes directly form detection, with some time delay included. A light sensitive film is used to photograph the projectile and its image on highly-reflective screens located on two walls at each individual station so the triggering system can not interfere with this operation. The current system is undesirable because it triggers for tracing OR non-tracing projectiles. This is a problem when the tracer intensity is inconsistent throughout the range. The first system should be designed for use in a range that has a cross-section 10 meters by 10 meters. The detection window should be 2 meters by 2 meters, and a total of 25 systems would be needed. There are 1 meter square trenches located on the floor of the range and the triggering device should be located in this area to fully protect it from any fragment damage. Other applications: the detection and triggering system could be used in any instance where detection of a moving object and subsequent action is required (in an elevator, for example). Measurement of projectile motion and acceleration is akin to measuring the same on aircraft or spacecraft. It could even be applied in robotics where the need for small components is also of interest. Phase I: Identify best techniques for obtaining on-board projectile motion and acceleration. Identify best technique for obtaining spin data. Identify and develop light sources and collection media. Perform initial spin measurements; interrogation by hand. Design of detection and triggering system. Phase II: Develop prototype system for measuring projectile motion and acceleration. Develop interrogation equipment and techniques.

One of the principal causes of aging is mass transfer due to the absorption and desorption of contamination inside the hermetically sealed resonator enclosure. Since it is not so much the contamination, as such, but the transfer of contamination which produces aging, the goal of this program is to minimize the contamination transfer rates. Past efforts aimed at reducing the effects of contamination have concentrated mainly on reducing the amount of contamination inside the enclosure via improved cleaning and ultrahigh vacuum processing techniques. This program is intended to develop novel methods of reducing the aging due to contamination transfer, by not only minimizing the amount of contamination inside the resonator enclosure but also by surface treatment methods (e.g., Langmuir-Blodgett (L-B) films) that can result in a significant reduction in mass transfer due to adsorption-desorption, without introducing new aging mechanisms (e.g., stress relief). Phase I: Phase I will explore novel contamination control and surface treatment methods (e.g., L-B films), or a combination of the two. The method(s) shall be applied to the fabrication of precision quartz resonators. Evidence shall be obtained to show the efficacy of the method(s).

This will enable installation flexibility due to the development of a navigator which is not vehicle specific as well as one that is a man portable.,"Movement of individuals (soldiers and vehicles) on the battlefield is an exceptionally important piece of information. The ability of a vehicle to know its’ position at all times greatly enhances effectiveness. In order to measure over the ground movement of a vehicle the odometer is attached to an encoder and the distance traveled by the vehicle becomes a function of the pulse train generated. This is sufficient for applications where the vehicle is known and the hardware can be obtained to attach the encoder to the odometer. In cases where this is not possible, an expensive accelerometer is required and as such the system will not be fielded. If a device could be developed that would measure the linear distance of travel from the motion of the ground under the vehicle, the such a system would be usable in any vehicle available to the soldier. In addition, the device might be adaptable to a man portable navigator so that the distance of a man’s travel could be accurately reported without requiring the calibration of the individuals stride length, a process which is very inaccurate.

It is desirable to delay the turn-on of the proximity sensor until after the apex of the trajectory in order to reduce the possibility of early functions due to electronic faults and to reduce the possibility of detection and neutralization of the fuze by jammers. However, the turn-on must be accomplished without inputs from the soldier. Thus an approach such as the setting of a turn-on time for the proximity sensor after reference to firing table data would be inappropriate. What is needed is a simple sensor and electronic processing circuit which would use information from the flight environment to determine and indicate when the projectile has achieved the apex of the trajectory. It should be borne in mind that the projectile is in free fall and thus its internal components will not inertially recognize an up-leg versus down-leg orientation along the trajectory as the velocity changes, with minima occurring at the apex. Of these two environments, pressure seems the more useful because the drag is very small, only a fraction of a ""g,” under all flight conditions. However, even pressure may be difficult to sense because the range of flight conditions causes pressure changes to range from a few psi out of ten, down to a tenth of a psi out of a few tenths. A sensor dynamic range and signal processing that can distinguish the transition from pre-apex decreasing pressure to post-apex increasing pressure may be needed. Other approaches may be possible. Target size for the apex sensor is less than 0.01 cubic inch exlusive of the electronic circuit. The electronic circuit should be capable of being integrated with the rest of the fuze electronics.

Fluoboric acid solution is used as the electrolyte in most of these liquid reserve batteries. HDL drawing 10974339 requires chemical analyses be done on the electrolyte to determine fluoboric acid (as tetrafluoborate), boric acid, and sulfate contents. The prescribed analytical procedures involve long and tedious wet chemical methods, some of which must be done at 1 degrees F to minimize side reactions that will introduce errors. Since they are manual operations and involve visual observation of titrametric end points, these procedures are prone to human error. For each shipping container of electrolyte, up to three days of alaboratory work are needed in order to quantify the three components. Further, the present wet chemical analyses identify only specific components of the acid. Therefore, the acid may pass all the wet chemical method tests but still have undesirable contaminations. For example, one common way that the power supply producer may lower an excessive sulfate content is to add lead fluoborate. This has the effect of reducing available active electrolyte, since it puts a preliminary bias in the cell reaction equilibrium. The current tests do no show excessive lead ion content, and hence cannot be used to monitor this undesirable action of the contractor. Phase I: The problems associated with the wet chemical method may be overcome by using Ion Chromatography (IC). Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that fluoboric acid may be analyzed in about 30 minutes using a potassium hydrogen phthalate solution as eluant, a Wescan Anion/R column, and a Wescan 213 conductivity detector. It has also been shown that IC can be used to find contaminants in the acid that the wet methods do not detect, such as bromide, sulfate, or lead. We anticipate that other equipment, columns, techniques, etc. would also be effective. We expect that total labor time for the analysis of a single shipping container of electrolyte involving testing of replicates will be reduced from approximately 24 man hours to about 2 man hours.

A major disadvantage to this gasket design is its ease of use and low cost. A major drawback though, is the gasket’s inability to maintain a reasonable RF shielding value for more than several months. A major cause for this shielding degradation can be linked to the inability of the silicon core to expand to its original shape after extended use (referred to as ""gasket set”). A possible solution to this problem would be to replace the solid gasket core with a hollow core and then add pressure to the gasket each time the door is opened to expand the gasket to its original shape. By assisting the gasket in expanding to its original shape, shielding degradation could be minimized. Pressurizing mechanism should not require power.

Transition to open-hatch operation and emergency egress are just the opposite: (1) the hatches open, (2) the seats rise to a pre-set height, and (3) the crewman continues to operate or commences egress. Phase I: Design and fabricate dynamics mock-ups which demonstrate the required mechanical interlocks, drive mechanisms, and manual back-up features. Phase II: Incorporate armrest controls and demonstrate continuity of operation over the full range of seat motion.
