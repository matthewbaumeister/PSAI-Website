Up to 75,000 of these claims may be unpaid, according to Ashlynne Haycock-Lohmann, director of Government and Legislative Affairs for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.\nAnd while VA officials lay the blame for the protracted payments delay largely with congressional Democrats, whom the administration holds responsible for the government shutdown that began Oct. 1, multiple groups are expressing frustration with the department\u2019s own actions and failure to find a solution.\n\u201cVA deployed a new benefit delivery system in August and anticipated having the ability to pay staff overtime and deploy automation solutions as needed to ensure a smooth transition and process fall enrollments on a timely basis,\u201d Peter Kasperowicz, a VA spokesman, told Military Times in an emailed statement. \u201cWhen the Democrats\u2019 shutdown hit, VA was deprived of these resources.\u201d\nHe added that federal law required the GI Bill hotline, which is typically used to identify and address payment issues, to be turned off during the shutdown. VA anticipates the pay issue won\u2019t be fully resolved until late November or early December, Kasperowicz said.\nThat\u2019s not satisfactory to Haycock-Lohmann.\n\u201cThe shutdown is not the cause of this, and it needs to be very clear that the reason that this happened is because VA\u2019s infrastructure failed, and they chose not to tell us until after the shutdown started,\u201d she said. \u201cVA could have told us in August.\u201d\nShe added that affected veterans never got clear communication about what was happening due to a communications plan that was upended after VA staff got furloughed in October.\nAn Oct. 9 letter to VA Secretary Doug Collins from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, and Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., the ranking members of the Senate and House Veterans Affairs Committees, expressed \u201cserious concern\u201d at the missed payments and gave the VA an Oct. 13 deadline to provide an explanation, outline the scope of the problem and explain its communications plan.\n\u201cThese payments are essential, mandatory funds that veterans and their families rely on for food, rent or mortgage payments, immediate needs, and financial stability,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\nA staff member with Blumenthal\u2019s office said VA had not yet sent a response to the letter. They added that VA had told congressional staff in August about a glitch that would affect 900 Chapter 35 students, saying the students had been contacted and the issue remediated. But no further information had been forthcoming even as the issue appears to be much larger, and they believed VA has not done any outreach about the matter.\nWill Hubbard, the vice president for Veterans and Military Policy at the organization Veterans Education Success and an architect of the current \u201cForever GI Bill,\u201d has been tracking the nonpayment issue closely since he was alerted to the problem by congressional staff.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no mass communications plan; there\u2019s no press release; there\u2019s no public anything,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really been a fundamental issue.\u201d\nFor Hubbard, the problem also fit a pattern of major VA platform or tech rollouts affecting GI Bill beneficiaries that took place right before the start of the fall semester, when enrollments were surging and tuition payments were coming due.\nHubbard wants assurances from VA that the rollout timing issue will be addressed for the future. He\u2019s also concerned that the VA\u2019s projected timeline for fixing the current problem is optimistic, and expressed concern about the \u201cdestabilizing\u201d impacts of missing payments that roll into next semester.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most worried about are the housing payment elements of this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause, you know, a school might be flexible, and I applaud that, but I suspect that landlords, their patience is going to run thin eventually. It\u2019s bad, obviously, to get dropped from school, but it\u2019s life changing if you\u2019re put out on the street.\u201d\nTAPS, meanwhile, is calling for the restoration of the GI Bill hotline and a surge in claims processors to accelerate resolution.\n\u201cWhat they should be doing is bringing back the call center, finding a way to fund the call center. Bring those employees back,\u201d Haycock-Lohmann said. \u201cIn future shutdown plans, make it very clear that the GI Bill hotline needs to be considered an essential program, and they need to bring back every processor right now.\u201d\nTAPS staff said they had seen success in \u201cback channel\u201d communication with congressional officials and VA Education Services over specific hardship cases to restore payments. Haycock-Lohmann said all affected students should know that schools are legally prohibited from dropping them over missed GI Bill payments. And, she said, survivors facing issues can reach TAPS for help with their case at casework@taps.org.\nShare:\nIn Other News\nMore shutdown assistance offered through military stores\nExtended period of interest-free commissary purchases and reduced-price meals for DOD school students affected by the government shutdown are available.\nProgram for youth caregivers, umpire academy among Fisher awardees\nFive nonprofits were awarded a total of $400,000 for their innovative support of troops, military families and veterans.\nTroops have been paid again, but what comes next?\nThe government pulled together funds to pay troops Oct. 15 and now Nov. 1, but officials said it\u2019s doubtful they'll be paid again if the shutdown persists.\nMilitary medical facilities aim to woo back Medicare-eligible patients\n21 military treatment facilities are prioritizing bringing back Tricare for Life patients.\nShutdown causes turmoil for some military families\u2019 food assistance\nIn the most recent DOD survey of active-duty military spouses, about 7% said they were using WIC benefits and 1% said they were using SNAP.\nLoad More", "published_date": "2025-11-03T15:30:18.600Z"}

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., questioned whether the Veterans Benefits Administration \u2014 the VA arm that manages disability compensation, pensions, education and employment benefits \u2014 needs subject matter experts to examine the claims processes and recommend improvements.\nAccording to Tuberville, the panel would be similar to the VA\u2019s Commission on Care, which reviewed the VA\u2019s health care system in the mid-2010s and made recommendations on veterans\u2019 medical services.\nThe VA also had an Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission that reviewed the VA hospital system in the early 2020s and made recommendations to modernize it.\nThose efforts resulted in mixed success, with some recommendations adopted, such as consolidating the VA\u2019s community care programs, and expanding access to urgent care and emergency care. But others, including the AIR Commission\u2019s recommendations to realign or close dozens of medical centers and clinics, were blocked.\nRELATED\nJudges reject VA secretary\u2019s request to pause veterans\u2019 claims appeals\nSecretary Collins asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims to stop its work during the government shutdown. Judges called the request \"extreme.\"\nBy\nPatricia\u00a0Kime\nThe Government Accountability Office has recommended the VA improve management of compensation programs and update its disability ratings schedule. It has put VBA on its \u201chigh risk\u201d list for \u201csignificant waste mismanagement\u201d and needs broad transformation, Elizabeth Curda, GAO\u2019s acting director of health care, said during the hearing Wednesday.\nA commission to address these concerns may not be the right approach, said Ryan Galluci, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Washington Office. Galluci said veterans service organizations generally have welcomed commission reviews but will object to any recommendations they see as reductions to VA services or facilities.\n\u201cI get nervous about the prospect of a commission,\u201d Galluci said. \u201cI remember with the AIR Commission \u2026 it couldn\u2019t make it past the first marker and now we are seeing the repercussions of that. \u2026 I would argue that a forum like this is certainly a good start to have these discussions.\u201d\nThe Washington Post\nrecently published several articles showcasing veterans who have abused the VA disability compensation system\n, saying the $193 billion program is a target for fraud, including veterans who fake injuries or illnesses for money.\nThe Post cited VA\u2019s own Office of Inspector General reports and Freedom of Information Act documents that showed veterans who claimed to be paralyzed for years could walk or feigned blindness to collect, at least in one case, nearly $400,000 in VA disability payments.\nNearly universally at the hearing, witnesses and lawmakers panned the reports, calling them \u201charmful\u201d and \u201cshaming,\u201d blaming veterans for the actions of outliers and not addressing the system itself.\n\u201cThe articles fail to understand or capture the purpose of [disability compensation]. Instead, they cherry pick anecdotes to wrongly claim that disability benefits system is fraught with widespread fraud,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat.\nBlumenthal conceded that fraud does occur but said that the system should not be abandoned as a result.\nRetired Army Lt. Col. Daniel Gade, a West Point graduate and Iraq War veteran, was a lone voice in the room, criticizing the system which he said incentivizes veterans to increase their disability ratings and discourages them from working or taking steps to improve their health by complying with treatment.\nGade said the current system \u201crobs veterans of purpose and dignity, trapping them in idleness and despair.\u201d\n\u201cThis system is anti-thriving, anti-productivity and ultimately, anti-veteran. Further, it discourages future generations serving by painting veterans as a troubled problem class,\u201d said Gade, who once served as Virginia\u2019s Veterans Commissioner of Veterans Affairs Services.\nAccording to VA Inspector General Cheryl Mason, 3.7% of fraud cases investigated by her office involve those perpetrated by veterans and the largest percentage of fraud investigated by the OIG is \u201cagainst VA and veterans.\u201d\nThe veterans services organization that testified had several solutions for fixing the system and ensuring that veterans receive appropriate compensation. Jeremy Villanueva, associate legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America, said the department needed to improve oversight of compensation and pension exams done by contractors and conduct more thorough reviews of claims paperwork submitted by veterans.\nJon Retzer, assistant national legislative director at Disabled American Veterans, said the VA must resource its claims department and optimize technology to streamline the application and approval process.\nGade recommended an overhaul of a system that gives ratings for illnesses such as hypertension \u2014 \u201cforgive the expression, old, fat people\u201d conditions, he said \u2014 requiring veterans receive mental health treatment if they get disability compensation for a mental health disorder and providing VA medical care for all service-connected conditions without tying them to disability ratings, \u201cremoving an incentive for false claims.\u201d\nTuberville did not say whether he will propose legislation to create a commission. Mason said the idea would be \u201cvery well placed.\u201d\n\u201cI think it is needed to look at the VBA process like it\u2019s supposed to do at VHA,\u201d Mason said.\nCommittee Chairman Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, promised more on the topic.\n\u201cThis is not the first and will not be the last conversation we have in exploring how to better serve veterans and improve the disability system,\u201d Moran said.\nAbout\nPatricia\u00a0Kime\nPatricia Kime is a senior writer covering military and veterans health care, medicine and personnel issues.\nShare:\nIn Other News\nMore shutdown assistance offered through military stores\nExtended period of interest-free commissary purchases and reduced-price meals for DOD school students affected by the government shutdown are available.\nProgram for youth caregivers, umpire academy among Fisher awardees\nFive nonprofits were awarded a total of $400,000 for their innovative support of troops, military families and veterans.\nTroops have been paid again, but what comes next?\nThe government pulled together funds to pay troops Oct. 15 and now Nov. 1, but officials said it\u2019s doubtful they'll be paid again if the shutdown persists.\nMilitary medical facilities aim to woo back Medicare-eligible patients\n21 military treatment facilities are prioritizing bringing back Tricare for Life patients.\nShutdown causes turmoil for some military families\u2019 food assistance\nIn the most recent DOD survey of active-duty military spouses, about 7% said they were using WIC benefits and 1% said they were using SNAP.\nLoad More", "published_date": "2025-10-30T18:43:29.943Z", "article_types": ["retirement"], "primary_article_type": "retirement"}

National Guard will be deployed to the nation\u2019s capital through the end of February, according to formal orders reviewed by The Associated Press.\nThe formal order, dated Nov. 4, extends the original order from Aug. 11 and says the Guard members will be in the city at least through Feb. 28. The order states the additional duty is in response to the emergency declared in August by President Donald Trump and under directions from the \u201cSecretary of War to protect federal property and functions in the District of Columbia and to support federal and District law enforcement.\u201d\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been in Washington since August, which launched what Trump said was a crime-fighting mission that also included the federal takeover of the local police department. That\norder expired in September\n, but the roughly 2,000 National Guard troops from D.C. and at at least eight states remain in the city, with most contingents saying they plan to withdraw by the end of November.\nThe D.C. National Guard is the single largest contributor of troops with 949 soldiers that make up the task force that totals 2,375 troops. West Virginia is the next largest state to contribute troops to the task force with 416 guardsmen.\nSome have been armed and providing a military presence in public spaces, especially in the federal parks around the city and at subway stations as well as the Amtrak train station.\nThe National Guard task force appears to have spent a large portion of its time on yardwork and landscaping efforts around the nation\u2019s capital. In an update provided in early October, task force officials boasted that troops cleared 1,150 bags of trash, spread 1,045 cubic yards of mulch, removed 50 truckloads of plant waste, cleared 7.9 miles of roadway, painted 270 feet of fencing and pruned 400 trees. Since then, most daily updates from the task force only offered new troop figures and no summaries of beautification efforts.\nRELATED\nTroops in DC encounter few crises, but plenty of walking and yard work\nDozens of troops who spoke to Military Times view their current deployment as \u201cpart of the job,\u201d but say they haven\u2019t seen \u201cemergency\u201d levels of crime.\nBy\nCarla\u00a0Babb\nOne segment of the D.C. Guard has worked with various neighborhoods on beautification efforts at the request of local neighborhood officials and residents.\nThe presence of guard members in the city is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit, filed Sept. 4 by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the National Guard in the heavily Democratic city. That lawsuit sparked filings by 45 states with 23 supporting the Trump administration and 22 aligning with Washington. The Trump administration has argued that he has full authority to deploy guard troops in Washington because he is the designated commander of the D.C. Guard.\nIn court papers filed by Schwalb seeking to have the guard removed from the city, the documents indicated that there were plans for the D.C. Guard to potentially remain in the city at least through next summer. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, heard arguments Oct. 24 on Schwalb\u2019s request but reached no decision.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the other states, which currently include Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama, will keep their troops deployed to the task force in Washington. Several of the states told the AP they planned to end their deployments by Nov. 30 but indicated that also depended on whether orders were issued extending their deployments. The order does not mention the other states.\nShare:\nIn Other News\nMore shutdown assistance offered through military stores\nExtended period of interest-free commissary purchases and reduced-price meals for DOD school students affected by the government shutdown are available.\nProgram for youth caregivers, umpire academy among Fisher awardees\nFive nonprofits were awarded a total of $400,000 for their innovative support of troops, military families and veterans.\nTroops have been paid again, but what comes next?\nThe government pulled together funds to pay troops Oct. 15 and now Nov. 1, but officials said it\u2019s doubtful they'll be paid again if the shutdown persists.\nMilitary medical facilities aim to woo back Medicare-eligible patients\n21 military treatment facilities are prioritizing bringing back Tricare for Life patients.\nShutdown causes turmoil for some military families\u2019 food assistance\nIn the most recent DOD survey of active-duty military spouses, about 7% said they were using WIC benefits and 1% said they were using SNAP.\nLoad More", "published_date": "2025-11-06T15:23:43.079Z"}

National Guard will be deployed to the nation\u2019s capital through the end of February, according to formal orders reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe formal order, dated Nov. 4, extends the original order from Aug. 11 and says the Guard members will be in the city at least through Feb. 28. The order states the additional duty is in response to the emergency declared in August by President Donald Trump and under directions from the \u201cSecretary of War to protect federal property and functions in the District of Columbia and to support federal and District law enforcement.\u201d\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been in Washington since August, which launched what Trump said was a crime-fighting mission that also included the federal takeover of the local police department. Thatorder expired in September, but the roughly 2,000 National Guard troops from D.C. and at at least eight states remain in the city, with most contingents saying they plan to withdraw by the end of November.\n\nThe D.C. National Guard is the single largest contributor of troops with 949 soldiers that make up the task force that totals 2,375 troops. West Virginia is the next largest state to contribute troops to the task force with 416 guardsmen.\n\nSome have been armed and providing a military presence in public spaces, especially in the federal parks around the city and at subway stations as well as the Amtrak train station.\n\nThe National Guard task force appears to have spent a large portion of its time on yardwork and landscaping efforts around the nation\u2019s capital. In an update provided in early October, task force officials boasted that troops cleared 1,150 bags of trash, spread 1,045 cubic yards of mulch, removed 50 truckloads of plant waste, cleared 7.9 miles of roadway, painted 270 feet of fencing and pruned 400 trees. Since then, most daily updates from the task force only offered new troop figures and no summaries of beautification efforts.\n\nOne segment of the D.C. Guard has worked with various neighborhoods on beautification efforts at the request of local neighborhood officials and residents.\n\nThe presence of guard members in the city is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit, filed Sept. 4 by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb challenging the Trump administration\u2019s use of the National Guard in the heavily Democratic city. That lawsuit sparked filings by 45 states with 23 supporting the Trump administration and 22 aligning with Washington. The Trump administration has argued that he has full authority to deploy guard troops in Washington because he is the designated commander of the D.C. Guard.\n\nIn court papers filed by Schwalb seeking to have the guard removed from the city, the documents indicated that there were plans for the D.C. Guard to potentially remain in the city at least through next summer. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, heard arguments Oct. 24 on Schwalb\u2019s request but reached no decision.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the other states, which currently include Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama, will keep their troops deployed to the task force in Washington. Several of the states told the AP they planned to end their deployments by Nov. 30 but indicated that also depended on whether orders were issued extending their deployments.

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., questioned whether the Veterans Benefits Administration \u2014 the VA arm that manages disability compensation, pensions, education and employment benefits \u2014 needs subject matter experts to examine the claims processes and recommend improvements.\n\nAccording to Tuberville, the panel would be similar to the VA\u2019s Commission on Care, which reviewed the VA\u2019s health care system in the mid-2010s and made recommendations on veterans\u2019 medical services.\n\nThe VA also had an Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission that reviewed the VA hospital system in the early 2020s and made recommendations to modernize it.\n\nThose efforts resulted in mixed success, with some recommendations adopted, such as consolidating the VA\u2019s community care programs, and expanding access to urgent care and emergency care. But others, including the AIR Commission\u2019s recommendations to realign or close dozens of medical centers and clinics, were blocked.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office has recommended the VA improve management of compensation programs and update its disability ratings schedule. It has put VBA on its \u201chigh risk\u201d list for \u201csignificant waste mismanagement\u201d and needs broad transformation, Elizabeth Curda, GAO\u2019s acting director of health care, said during the hearing Wednesday.\n\nA commission to address these concerns may not be the right approach, said Ryan Galluci, executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Washington Office. Galluci said veterans service organizations generally have welcomed commission reviews but will object to any recommendations they see as reductions to VA services or facilities.\n\n\u201cI get nervous about the prospect of a commission,\u201d Galluci said. \u201cI remember with the AIR Commission \u2026 it couldn\u2019t make it past the first marker and now we are seeing the repercussions of that. \u2026 I would argue that a forum like this is certainly a good start to have these discussions.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Postrecently published several articles showcasing veterans who have abused the VA disability compensation system, saying the $193 billion program is a target for fraud, including veterans who fake injuries or illnesses for money.\n\nThe Post cited VA\u2019s own Office of Inspector General reports and Freedom of Information Act documents that showed veterans who claimed to be paralyzed for years could walk or feigned blindness to collect, at least in one case, nearly $400,000 in VA disability payments.\n\nNearly universally at the hearing, witnesses and lawmakers panned the reports, calling them \u201charmful\u201d and \u201cshaming,\u201d blaming veterans for the actions of outliers and not addressing the system itself.\n\n\u201cThe articles fail to understand or capture the purpose of [disability compensation]. Instead, they cherry pick anecdotes to wrongly claim that disability benefits system is fraught with widespread fraud,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat.\n\nBlumenthal conceded that fraud does occur but said that the system should not be abandoned as a result.\n\nRetired Army Lt. Col. Daniel Gade, a West Point graduate and Iraq War veteran, was a lone voice in the room, criticizing the system which he said incentivizes veterans to increase their disability ratings and discourages them from working or taking steps to improve their health by complying with treatment.\n\nGade said the current system \u201crobs veterans of purpose and dignity, trapping them in idleness and despair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis system is anti-thriving, anti-productivity and ultimately, anti-veteran. Further, it discourages future generations serving by painting veterans as a troubled problem class,\u201d said Gade, who once served as Virginia\u2019s Veterans Commissioner of Veterans Affairs Services.\n\nAccording to VA Inspector General Cheryl Mason, 3.7% of fraud cases investigated by her office involve those perpetrated by veterans and the largest percentage of fraud investigated by the OIG is \u201cagainst VA and veterans.\u201d\n\nThe veterans services organization that testified had several solutions for fixing the system and ensuring that veterans receive appropriate compensation.
