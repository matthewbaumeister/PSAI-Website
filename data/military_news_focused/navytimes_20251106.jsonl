In those cases, the email said, service members must be out of uniform.\nSome commenters on the amn/nco/snco post expressed confusion and frustration as to why the Pentagon would issue such restrictions.\n\u201cIf you have earned the right to wear the uniform, and are doing so in a respectful way, then do whatever the hell you want,\u201d one commenter said.\nWhen contacted by Military Times on Wednesday, spokespeople with both U.S. Air Force public affairs and the Pentagon\u2019s public affairs office initially confirmed the Defense Department had issued the guidance restricting service members\u2019 outreach activities and uniform wear at the beginning of the shutdown. The DOD was re-emphasizing those rules as Veterans Day approached, they said.\nBut later, the Pentagon changed course. A Pentagon official said the department is not restricting service members from attending local Veterans Day events in uniform. The official said such events are seen as helping with recruiting efforts, and that recruiting is one of the activities that can continue during a shutdown.\nIn addition to appearances at sporting events, outreach events could include service members visiting schools in uniform around Veterans Day and talking with kids about military service, the official said \u2014 or marching in a parade \u2014 as long as the department isn\u2019t spending travel money to transport them to the events.\n\u201cThe public affairs guidance on Department of War community outreach activities during a lapse of appropriations remains the same,\u201d the official said in a statement Thursday, using the administration\u2019s preferred name for the department. \u201cService members are to wear their uniforms in accordance with their service regulation.\u201d\nVeterans Day is observed in the U.S. each year on Nov. 11, the anniversary of the armistice that went into effect on that date in 1918 to end World War I. It was first established as a national holiday in 1938, when it was called Armistice Day and honored WWI veterans, and was renamed Veterans Day in 1954 to honor all U.S. war veterans.\nSince then, communities nationwide have observed Veterans Day with celebrations of all sizes that salute both veterans of past wars and current service members.\nNew York City\u2019s annual Veterans Day Parade is the largest in the country, and one of its grand marshals this year will be former Army Staff Sgt. Clint Romesha, who received the Medal of Honor for his heroism during the 2009 Battle of Kamdesh in Afghanistan.\nIn past years, current service members and their units have been among the thousands marching in New York\u2019s parade. Organizers said on the New York parade\u2019s website that they expect more than 20,000 marchers this year.\nAbout\nStephen\u00a0Losey\nStephen Losey is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

The Trump administration increasingly has tapped the military to bolster its immigration crackdown, from\ndeploying to the southern border\nand a\nseries of American cities\n.\nThis week\u2019s memo says the Justice Department asked for 20 lawyers to help support its offices in Memphis, where\nthe National Guard has been deployed\nby President Donald Trump; 12 for West Texas \u2014 specifically for the cities of El Paso, Del Rio, and Midland \u2014 and three lawyers and two paralegals for Las Cruces, New Mexico.\nThe memo does not specify what kind of litigation the volunteers would be asked to do, but it says that, ideally, attorneys would have \u201csignificant experience\u201d in immigration and administrative law in addition to general prosecution and litigation experience.\nThe Pentagon said in a statement that it was \u201cproud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our law enforcement partners, bringing the skill and dedication of America\u2019s service members to deliver justice, restore order, and protect the American people.\u201d\nThe Justice Department also confirmed the memo\u2019s authenticity but did not provide additional details on the reason for its request or what the attorneys would be doing.\nAs with the prior request for hundreds of military attorneys to work as immigration judges, it is not immediately clear what impact removing a growing number of lawyers would have on the armed forces\u2019 justice system. The attorneys, called judge advocates, have a range of duties much like civilian lawyers, from carrying out prosecutions, acting as defense attorneys or offering legal advice to service members.\nThe new request follows a Sept. 26 ask from the Justice Department for 35 attorneys and two paralegals from the military, according to the memo. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if that number was in addition to the 48 attorneys requested this week.\nThe AP also reviewed an email that was sent to military attorneys on Sept. 12 that said the Pentagon was looking for volunteers to become special assistant U.S. attorneys in West Texas and New Mexico without mentioning a total figure.\nIt is not clear how successful the Pentagon has been at getting lawyers to volunteer, but at least some of the services have been making the case to their attorneys through messages like the one sent by the Army\u2019s top lawyer.\n\u201cThese roles offer unparalleled opportunity to refine your advocacy, courtroom procedure, and functional knowledge of the federal legal system for future use in our military justice system or civil litigation,\u201d Major Gen. Bobby Christine said in an email reviewed by the AP.\nChristine said the work would be \u201cin support of national priorities.\u201d\nHowever, Hegseth\u2019s memo says that services only had until Thursday to identify the attorneys and alluded to troops being subject to involuntary mobilization orders.\nThe Army and Navy did not respond to questions about how many attorneys from their respective services are being sent to the Justice Department. The Air Force directed questions to the Pentagon.\nAssociated Press writer Alanna Durkin Richer contributed to this report.\nShare:\nIn Other News\nMore shutdown assistance offered through military stores\nExtended period of interest-free commissary purchases and reduced-price meals for DOD school students affected by the government shutdown are available.\nProgram for youth caregivers, umpire academy among Fisher awardees\nFive nonprofits were awarded a total of $400,000 for their innovative support of troops, military families and veterans.\nTroops have been paid again, but what comes next?\nThe government pulled together funds to pay troops Oct. 15 and now Nov. 1, but officials said it\u2019s doubtful they'll be paid again if the shutdown persists.\nMilitary medical facilities aim to woo back Medicare-eligible patients\n21 military treatment facilities are prioritizing bringing back Tricare for Life patients.\nShutdown causes turmoil for some military families\u2019 food assistance\nIn the most recent DOD survey of active-duty military spouses, about 7% said they were using WIC benefits and 1% said they were using SNAP.\nLoad More", "published_date": "2025-10-30T23:06:25.347Z", "article_types": ["assignment"], "primary_article_type": "assignment"}

The change is especially stark after the U.S. joined Israeli strikes on Iran in June and has engaged in some of the most intense combat operations since World War II against Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.\nAircraft carriers, with their thousands of sailors and dozens of warplanes, have long been recognized as one of the ultimate signifiers of U.S. military might and the nation\u2019s foreign policy priorities. There have been five carrier deployments to the Middle East since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, including two carriers in the region at multiple points this year and last.\nThe new orders for the USS Gerald R. Ford illustrate the Trump administration\u2019s\nincreasing focus on the Western Hemisphere\nand mark a major escalation of firepower as the U.S. military ramps up\nfatal strikes on alleged drug boats\n. With a buildup of warships, aircraft and troops already in the region, Trump himself has signaled what could be next.\nSpeaking from another aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, in its home port of Japan, Trump noted the U.S. attacks at sea and reiterated that \u201cnow we\u2019ll stop the drugs coming in by land.\u201d\nMark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a retired Marine colonel, questioned how long the Ford would be able to remain in\nSouth America\n, when only three of the 11 U.S. aircraft carriers are typically out to sea.\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful and scarce resource, there will be a lot of pressure to do something or send it elsewhere,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cYou can imagine the peace negotiations breaking down in the eastern Mediterranean or something happening with Iran.\u201d\nThe USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, operates in the Norwegian Sea above the Arctic Circle, Aug. 30, 2025. (PO2 Daniel Ruiz/U.S. Navy)\nThe USS Nimitz also is deployed but is heading home from the South China Sea to the West Coast before being decommissioned.\nIt recently lost two aircraft\n\u2014 a fighter jet and a helicopter \u2014 in separate crashes that are under investigation. A third carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, is not deployed but is conducting exercises off the coast of San Diego.\nThe shift is happening just as violence has flared up again in Gaza despite a ceasefire that Trump helped broker after two years of war. The Israeli army launched a barrage of attacks Tuesday as tensions with Hamas grew two weeks into the fragile ceasefire.\nCarrier\u2019s move adds pressure on Venezuela\nMeanwhile, the U.S. military\u2019s growing presence near Venezuela and its 13 fatal strikes on alleged drug boats have stoked fears that Trump could try to topple authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.\nIn response to questions about the speculation, Secretary of State Marco Rubio insisted Saturday that the U.S. is taking part in a counterdrug operation. And he again accused Maduro\u2019s government of participating in the shipment of narcotics.\n\u201cThis is a very serious problem for the hemisphere, and a very destabilizing one,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd that has to be addressed.\u201d\nMaduro said in a recent national broadcast that the Trump administration is manufacturing a war against him.\n\u201cThey are fabricating an extravagant narrative, a vulgar, criminal and totally fake one,\u201d Maduro added. \u201cVenezuela is a country that does not produce cocaine leaves.\u201d\nA woman walks past graffiti against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas. (Juan Barreto/ AFP via Getty Images)\nExperts say the U.S. forces in the region aren\u2019t large enough for an invasion. But they could help push out Maduro \u2014 and possibly plunge the nation into chaos.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really high potential for violence and instability,\u201d according to Geoff Ramsey, an expert on U.S. policy toward Venezuela who is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. If Maduro loses power, he said Venezuela could \u201cdevolve into a Libya-style meltdown that could last years.\u201d\nLand strikes are \u2018a real possibility\u2019\nThe Ford strike group, which includes five destroyers, will add to an unusually large U.S. military buildup in the waters off Venezuela. The Navy already has eight warships in the region \u2014 three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship that\u2019s designed for coastal waters. It was not clear if all five of the destroyers in the Ford strike group would make the journey.\nA U.S. Navy submarine also is operating in the broader area of South America and is capable of launching cruise missiles. The U.S. military also sent a squadron of F-35B Lightning II fighter jets to an airstrip in Puerto Rico and recently flew a pair of supersonic, heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela.\nThe administration says the military has killed at least 57 people in the strikes against vessels accused of transporting drugs. Trump has declared drug cartels to be unlawful combatants because of narcotics flowing into the country and said the U.S. is in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with them, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration after 9/11.\nLawmakers from both political parties have expressed concerns about Trump\u2019s lack of congressional approval and unwillingness to provide details about the attacks. Others, such as Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, believe the president has all the authority he needs.\nThe South Carolina Republican said Sunday on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that land strikes in Venezuela are \u201ca real possibility.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit on the sidelines and watch boats full of drugs come to our country,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to blow them up and kill the people that want to poison America, and we\u2019re now going to expand operations, I think, to the land.\u201d\nShare:\nIn Other News\nMore shutdown assistance offered through military stores\nExtended period of interest-free commissary purchases and reduced-price meals for DOD school students affected by the government shutdown are available.\nProgram for youth caregivers, umpire academy among Fisher awardees\nFive nonprofits were awarded a total of $400,000 for their innovative support of troops, military families and veterans.\nTroops have been paid again, but what comes next?\nThe government pulled together funds to pay troops Oct. 15 and now Nov. 1, but officials said it\u2019s doubtful they'll be paid again if the shutdown persists.\nMilitary medical facilities aim to woo back Medicare-eligible patients\n21 military treatment facilities are prioritizing bringing back Tricare for Life patients.\nShutdown causes turmoil for some military families\u2019 food assistance\nIn the most recent DOD survey of active-duty military spouses, about 7% said they were using WIC benefits and 1% said they were using SNAP.\nNo more stories", "published_date": "2025-10-29T13:12:36.304Z", "article_types": ["retirement"], "primary_article_type": "retirement"}
