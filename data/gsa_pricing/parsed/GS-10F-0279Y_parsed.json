This Computer Programmer performs routine programming assignments that do not require skilled background experience but do require knowledge of established programming procedures and data processing requirements, and works according to clear-cut and complete specifications. The data are refined, and the format of the final product is very similar to that of the input, or is well defined when significantly different, i.e., there are few, if any, problems with interrelating varied records and outputs. The Computer Programmer II maintains and modifies routine programs, makes approved changes by amending program flow charts, developing detailed processing logic, and coding changes, tests and documents modifications and writes operator instructions, may write routine new programs using prescribed specifications, and may confer with EDP personnel to clarify procedures, processing logic, etc. In addition, the Computer Programmer II may evaluate simple interrelationships in the immediate programming area confers with user representatives to gain an understanding of the situation sufficient to formulate the needed change, and implements the change upon approval of the supervisor or higher level staff The incumbent is provided with charts, narrative descriptions of the functions performed, an approved statement of the product desired (e.g., a change in a local establishment report), and the inputs, outputs, and record formats.
