The smart device application (app) is functional on all major platform operating systems (Apple iOS [iPhone, iPad, iPad Mini, iPod Touch] and Android OS); sometimes referred to as the \u201cMobile Solutions\u201d. This allows you to deploy the mobile solution immediately to any person, your users, subcontractors, or partners, without having to invest in new smart device hardware. The field users will have easy access to all forms (with or without cellular coverage). Completed Pocket Forms form templates (\u201cforms\u201d) on a device are sent instantly to the web / cloud database. The field teams can still complete the forms and input all the information without network coverage and data is automatically transmitted as soon upon access to a network. The Pocket Forms leverages your existing smart devices. The creation of forms is easy and has question types that allow users to incorporate drawings, photos, multiple choice, checkbox selections, digital voice notes, GPS location, electronic signatures, and barcode scanning.  There is an option to have each completed form submitted to the Pocket Forms database to be converted into a PDF or Excel report and emailed for instant feedback to key stakeholders. \nToolbox Integration (SDK command server)\nThe Toolbox Integration (\u201cToolbox\u201d) solution is the best mobility development platform in the marketplace tailored specifically for IT/IS teams to \u2018mobilize their organizations\u2019 databases\u2019. The Toolbox empowers any IT/IS team to be totally self-directed in the integration and deployment of a \u2018mobile module\u2019 to their existing enterprise systems without ever having to write a line of native app code. Your team leverages the Toolbox platform and the embedded coding engines to create, deploy, dispatch, reassign, modify, and retrieve Pocket Forms data and documents using only XML commands to the SDK server; no native app programming is needed, just simple bidirectional XML data transfer protocols. The Toolbox solutions support Apple iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, iPad Mini) and Android OS devices. Pocket Forms mobile application works flawlessly in online and offline situations (with or without conductivity); User do not need to have to have network or coverage to continue to work. The Toolbox solution comes with a Web-based IT Integrators\u2019 testing console for easy deployment with a variety of tools and functionality: web user & mobile user profile management, security/rights, auto-instruction delivery to new mobile users by email / SMS, testing, and diagnostic tools, and much more. The Toolbox solution does NOT duplicate the existing organ",
