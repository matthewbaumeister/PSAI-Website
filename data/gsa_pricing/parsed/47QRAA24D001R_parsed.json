        "description": "The position is responsible for providing cost- and price-related support and advice to contracting offices and program offices in these areas; conducting comprehensive cost analyses for critical acquisitions; analyzing contractor costs and ensuring that they align with cost estimates; and recommending new policies and business processes to achieve greater efficiency in the Department\u2019s acquisition functions. Cost Analysis - Performs cost and price analyses on competitive and non-competitive multiple-year procurement actions for major programs, systems acquisitions, and contract actions valued in the multi-million and multi-billion-dollar ranges using a wide variety of conventional and cutting edge price and cost analysis techniques and tools. Prepares reports of findings on these high-interest actions that include actual and potential issues and problems along with strategies to address and resolve them, lessons-learned, and recommendations for improving future acquisitions, negotiating more advantageous cost and price mechanisms, and implementing efficiencies to drive down costs. Provides expert advice to senior management, customers, and other acquisition professionals in the areas of: review of cost/price proposals; review of supporting documentation; and writing cost and price analyses. Leads discussions on cost/price issues with senior acquisition, program, and/or contractor officials, and resolves complex and/or costly problems. Pre-Award - Develops contractual pricing arrangements and incentives such as multiple incentives requiring use of sophisticated costing techniques; sharing arrangements, such as cost-plus-incentive-fee or fixed-price incentive fee, where the Government and the contractor share the cost risk; or economic price adjustment clauses that identify the basis for adjusting certain labor or material costs where price cannot be reasonably predicted at the time of contract negotiation. Recommends the development of cost/price terms and related terms in solicitations and contracts and negotiates these terms with vendors and other parties. Evaluates contractor responsibility, financial soundness, and past performance, costs of previous procurements, and related factors to determine the cost effectiveness of various bids and identifies potential problems that could occur. Post-Award - Conducts systematic and comprehensive cost assessments of acquisitions to ensure that contractor costs are consistent with cost estimates submitted and that incentives are awarded properly. Where appropriate, investigates inappropriate variances; identifies reasons; and prepares and negotiates solutions with customers and vendors. Develops new approaches and strategies for collecting and validating cost data. Coordinates requests for audits among external audit agencies (e.g., Defense Contract Audit Agency), and internal acquisition and program staff. Reviews audit reports, reports results, and makes recommendations to the Contracting Officer. Requ",
