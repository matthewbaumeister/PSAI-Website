The Senior Systems Analyst applies systems analysis and design techniques to complex computer information systems in a broad area such as: (1) finance management; (2) logistics planning; or (3) engineering. Usually, there are multiple users of the system; however, there may be complex one-user systems, e.g., for engineering or research projects. The Senior Systems Analyst must be competent in all phases of systems analysis techniques, concepts, methods, and knowledge of available system software, computer equipment, and regulations, structure, techniques and management practices. Since input data usually come from diverse sources, the analyst is responsible for recognizing probable conflicts and integrating diverse data elements and sources. The Senior Systems Analyst produces innovative solutions for a variety of complex problems. The Software Engineer maintains and modifies complex systems or develops new subsystems such as an integrated production scheduling, inventory control, cost analysis, or sales analysis record in which every item of each type is automatically processed through the full system of records. The Senior Systems Analyst performs the following activities: (1) guides users in formulating requirements; (2) advises on alternatives and on the implications of new or revised data processing systems; (3) analyzes resulting user project proposals; (4) identifies omissions and errors in requirements and conducts feasibility studies; (5) recommends an optimum approach and develops the system design for approved projects; (6) interprets information and informally arbitrates between system users when conflicts exist. The Senior System Analyst may serve as Lead Analyst in a design subgroup, directing and integrating the work of lower-level analysts, each responsible for several programs.
