These competencies are related within federal agencies and do overlap. For clarity, a computer scientist working on Engineering Services projects primarily focus on physical multiple sensor and communications systems, real time and mission critical systems while the software engineer working in support of Computer Systems Support would focus on database, shared services, systems integration or related workflow for administrative system.",

The major difference within the competencies is typically the real time and safety critical experiences required to support engineering services projects. Analytical experienced professionals may be used to support the administrative systems required for Computer/Information Systems Development and Computer Systems Support projects. These competencies are related within federal agencies and do overlap. For clarity, a computer scientist working on Engineering Services projects primarily focus on physical multiple sensor and communications systems, real time and mission critical systems while the software engineer working in support of Computer Systems Support would focus on database, shared services, systems integration or related workflow for administrative system.",

The major difference within the competencies is typically the real time and safety critical experiences required to support engineering services projects. Analytical experienced professionals may be used to support the administrative systems required for Computer/Information Systems Development and Computer Systems Support projects. These competencies are related within federal agencies and do overlap. For clarity, a computer scientist working on Engineering Services projects primarily focus on physical multiple sensor and communications systems, real time and mission critical systems while the software engineer working in support of Computer Systems Support would focus on database, shared services, systems integration or related workflow for administrative system.",
