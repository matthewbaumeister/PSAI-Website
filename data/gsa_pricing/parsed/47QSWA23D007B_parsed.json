In situation 1), LPNs provide nursing care for patients in various stages of dependency, setting priorities and deadlines for patient care as necessary prior to notifying the supervisor. In situation 2), LPNs are assigned to a selected group of critically ill patients, e.g., in hospital intensive care or coronary care units. These assignments require LPNs to immediately recognize and respond to serious situations, sometimes before notifying an RN. However, their overall independence and authority is more limited than that described in situation 1, and supervisory approval is required for proposed deviations from established guidelines.",

These tests could be accomplished anywhere in the USA, Puerto Rico, and American Trust Territories, for any of the type of alcohol or drug tests required, i.e., random, pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, or follow-up. Requests for testing will occur well in advance for random and follow-up testing and will typically involve a large volume of tests. The Scheduler must determine the appropriate offices, Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT), and/or subcontractor performing the tests according to location or other factors. The request must be communicated to the responsible offices with the dates/times, etc. confirmed with the client. Any subsequent changes must be coordinated with all parties. If travel costs involving air travel, hotel, rental car, or mileage over 100 miles, this must be pre-approved by the client. The Scheduler is expected to choose the most cost-effective approach to completing the test requirements.",
