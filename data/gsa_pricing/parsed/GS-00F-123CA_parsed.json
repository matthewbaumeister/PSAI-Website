Makes technical cost estimating decisions, which are considered authoritative, and which demonstrate mature cost estimating judgment in anticipating and solving complex cost analysis problems.  Work requires the technical capability to assess the cost and schedule implications of existing and projected technological advances, as well as being able to evaluate the impact of new and innovative acquisition strategies.  Work is reviewed by the Contract Manager or Manager of Major Project (s) to ensure it satisfies customer needs and complies with the contractor'\u2019 overall estimating standards.",
