Cyber Hunt activities start with the premise that threat actors known to target some organizations in a specific industry, or specific systems, are likely to also target other organizations in the same industry or with the same systems. Use information and threat intelligence specifically focused on the proximate incident to identify undiscovered attacks. Investigates and analyzes all relevant response activities.  Functional Responsibilities: \u2022 Comprehend all aspects of Cybersecurity and apply expertise in technical Cyber threat intelligence to identify gaps in organizational communications, processes, and training quickly.  \u2022 Monitor open-source information feeds and threat actor activity to identify activity levels and indicators for Cyber threats and Cyber attacks. \u2022 Mine open data sources to identify potential Cyber threats, targets of interest, and timeframes for attacks. Analyze and research known indicators, correlate events, identify malicious activity, and discover new sources to provide early warnings for a variety of Cyber threats.  \u2022 Work closely with threat analysts, incident responders, and others to publish tactical, operational, and strategic client products and public blog posts.  \u2022 Research reports and work as part of a team to research Cyber attack and intrusion vectors, malware, and advanced adversaries.",
