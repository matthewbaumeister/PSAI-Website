        "description": "Senior Report Developers compile data into reports using department and company goals as a filter for processing relevant data.  They work closely with client representatives to determine requirements for reports.  The objective is to ensure that all staff have access to relevant information that they need in their daily tasks.  Once requirements are understood, the reports are developed in a manner that is easily accessible and that users can adjust in order to specify the needed data.  Configuration of the reports to connect with databases of information and present the relevant information needed for specific, identified purposes in order to be useful is performed.  This may include multiple systems to collect data from multiple sources, allowing staff the access to all relevant information.  Testing of reports is crucial before delivery to the client.  As a Senior Report Developer, mentoring and teaching is expected, as is developing of more complex reports.",
