The Computer Programmer II maintains and modifies routine programs, makes approved changes by amending program flow charts, developing detailed processing logic, and coding changes, tests and documents modifications and writes operator instructions, may write routine new programs using prescribed specifications, and may confer with EDP personnel to clarify procedures, processing logic, etc. In addition, the Computer Programmer II may evaluate simple interrelationships in the immediate programming area confers with user representatives to gain an understanding of the situation sufficient to formulate the needed change, and implements the change upon approval of the supervisor or higher level staff. The incumbent is provided with charts, narrative descriptions of the functions performed, an approved statement of the product desired (e.g., a change in a local establishment report), and the inputs, outputs, and record formats. This Worker reviews objectives and assignment details with higher level staff to insure thorough understanding; uses judgment in selecting among authorized procedures and seeks assistance when guidelines are inadequate, significant deviations are proposed, or when unanticipated problems arise.
