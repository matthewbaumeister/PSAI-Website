Locates lost documents or reconstructs information using a number of sources. May check references of applicants when information in addition to dates and places of past work is needed, and judgment is required to ask appropriate routine follow-up questions. Performs routine personnel assignments beyond the clerical level, such as: orienting new employees to programs, facilities, rules on time and attendance, and leave policies; computing basic statistical information for reports on manpower profiles, EEO progress and accomplishments, hiring activities, attendance and leave profiles, turnover, etc.; and screening applicants for well-defined positions, rejecting those who do not qualify for available openings for clear cut reasons, referring others to appropriate employment interviewer.",
