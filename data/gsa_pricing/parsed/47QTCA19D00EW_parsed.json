Performs verification activities on work products using defined methods, procedures and criteria with an appropriate verification environment. Documents and communicates test results. Supports analysis of test results and resolution of open issues. Documents and works to resolve all complex problems. Reports progress on problem resolution to management. Devises improvements to current procedures and develops models of possible future configurations.  Creates daily test metrics and reporting.  Occasionally performs other IT systems engineering activities such as requirements, design, installation, operation, sustainment, and support. provide Constructive Models/Virtual Simulator testing support including the following: a. Performing functional/operational testing. b. Developing functional/operational test plans. c. Drafting Product Suitability Documentation (Section F, Deliverable 21) and Evaluation Reports (Section F, Deliverable 22) and identifying any critical issues associated with Responsible Testing Organization requirements. d. Facilitating the testing and training on M&S technologies utilized by the Government and the operation of equipment/ SW during technical demonstrations. e. Providing technical subject matter expertise on IT, HW, SW, technology, and engineering as it relates to M&S. f. Assisting with the development, modification, integration, and testing of GFE and Government-owned computer SW (e.g., Joint Data Translator) in support of technical requirements. g. Testing the integration/demonstration of HW/SW (e.g., COTS, GOTS, and GFE) for assessment against the initiatives\u2019 technical requirements. h. Assisting test exercise/event personnel remotely or on-site at the exercise/event test to ensure the constructive models/virtual simulators are functioning accurately and that communication feeds work in conjunction with the simulation developers, and assisting in addressing questions related to the technical aspects of the models/simulators in support of the exercise/event. i. Advising the Government of any simulation performance issues identified during testing.
