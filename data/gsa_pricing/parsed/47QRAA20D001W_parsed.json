The Secretary maintains a close and highly responsive relationship to the day-to-day activities of the supervisor and staff, works fairly independently receiving a minimum of detailed supervision and guidance, and performs various clerical and secretarial duties requiring knowledge of office routine and an understanding of the organization, programs, and procedures related to the work of the office. Computers may exist in the environment, requiring working knowledge of certain office software programs.  Organizational structure is not complex and internal procedures and administrative controls are simple and informal; supervisor directs staff through face-to-face meetings. Carries out recurring office procedures independently,  and selects the guideline or reference that fits the specific case. The supervisor provides specific instructions on new assignments and checks completed work for accuracy. Some of the duties are:  a. Respond to routine telephone requests that have standard answers; refer calls and visitors to appropriate staff. Control mail and assure timely staff response, and send form letters;  b. As instructed, maintain supervisor's calendar, make appointments, and arrange for meeting rooms; c. Review materials prepared for supervisor's approval for typographical accuracy and proper format;  d. Maintain recurring internal reports, such as time and leave records, office equipment listings, correspondence controls, and training plans;  e.

Executive's program(s) are usually interlocked on a direct and continuing basis with other major organizational segments, requiring constant attention to extensive formal coordination, clearances, and procedural controls. Executive typically has financial decision-making authority for assigned program(s); considerable impact on the entire organization's financial position or image; and responsibility for, or has staff specialists in such areas as, personnel and administration for assigned organization. Executive plays an important role in determining the policies and major programs of the entire organization, and spends considerable time dealing with outside parties actively interested in assigned program(s) and current or controversial issues. The Secretary III uses greater judgment and initiative to determine the approach or action to take in non-routine situations, interprets and adapts guidelines, including unwritten policies, precedents, and practices, which are not always completely applicable to changing situations. Duties include or are comparable to the following:  a. Based on knowledge of the supervisor's views, compose correspondence on own initiative about administrative matters and general office policies for supervisor's approval;  b. Anticipate and prepare materials needed by the supervisor for conferences, correspondence, appointments, meetings, telephone calls, etc., and informs supervisor on matters to be considered;  c.

The majority of assignments are performed without technical assistance, but unusually difficult travel situations or problem cases encountered during the course of the work are referred to the supervisor before decision or commitment.

These projects require the Illustrator to be proficient in the use of these media and in executing acceptable drawings in many styles. Generally, Illustrator II executes drawings that have been conceived by others and presented in the form of rough sketches. This illustrator does not exercise an extensive knowledge of the subject matter involved when preparing medical, scientific or technical equipment illustrations, but does acquire information about the subject assigned to illustrate and develop a background of subject matter knowledge through carrying out these illustrating assignments. However, the kind of illustrating work assigned does not require an extensive prior knowledge about the subjects illustrated.",

This degree of skill is required for the following reasons: (a) the speed with which the illustration must be completed requires the ability to work quickly and competently in order to produce an acceptable finished product within the available time limit. (b) The illustration calls for the use of fine detail, special artistic effects, or an unusual use of the chosen medium or; (c) The method of reproduction, how the illustration will be used, or the information or artistic results desired, calls for exceptional care and skill in the use of the medium. The themes illustrated may be either concrete in nature or they may represent ideas and abstract concepts. The illustrations differ from those typical of Illustrator II in that they are expected to interpret the publications, chart, poster, or exhibit in which they appear, while Illustrator II presents factual, rather than interpretative material. Illustrator III is required to have knowledge of a specialized subject matter field such as medicine, science, or technical equipment, and will prepare illustrations that are designed to reproduce the appearance of specific medical or scientific specimens or of pieces of technical equipment.",

This photographer sets up precise photographic measurement and control equipment; uses high speed color photography, synchronized stroboscopic (interval) light sources, and/or timed electronic triggering; operates equipment from a remote point; or arranges and uses cameras operating at several thousand frames per second.

This degree of skill is required for the following reasons: (a) the speed with which the illustration must be completed requires the ability to work quickly and competently in order to produce an acceptable finished product within the available time limit. (b) The illustration calls for the use of fine detail, special artistic effects, or an unusual use of the chosen medium or; (c) The method of reproduction, how the illustration will be used, or the information or artistic results desired, calls for exceptional care and skill in the use of the medium. The themes illustrated may be either concrete in nature or they may represent ideas and abstract concepts. The illustrations differ from those typical of Illustrator II in that they are expected to interpret the publications, chart, poster, or exhibit in which they appear, while Illustrator II presents factual, rather than interpretative material. Illustrator III is required to have knowledge of a specialized subject matter field such as medicine, science, or technical equipment, and will prepare illustrations that are designed to reproduce the appearance of specific medical or scientific specimens or of pieces of technical equipment.",
