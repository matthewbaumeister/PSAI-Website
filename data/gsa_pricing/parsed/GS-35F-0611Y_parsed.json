(b)The illustration calls for the use of fine detail, special artistic effects, or an unusual use of the chosen medium or; (c)The method of reproduction, how the illustration will be used, or the information or artistic results desired, calls for exceptional care and skill in the use of the medium. The themes illustrated may be either concrete in nature or they may represent ideas and abstract concepts. The illustrations differ from those typical of Illustrator II in that they are expected to interpret the publications, chart, poster, or exhibit in which they appear, while Illustrator II presents factual, rather than interpretative material. Illustrator III is required to have knowledge of a specialized subject matter field such as medicine, science, or technical equipment, and will prepare illustrations that are designed to reproduce the appearance of specific medical or scientific specimens or of pieces of technical equipment.",

Typically, the subjects photographed are similar to those at Level I, but the technical aspects require more skill. Based on clear-cut objectives, this Worker determines shutter speeds, lens settings and filters, camera angles, exposure times, and type of film. This position requires familiarity with the situation gained from similar past experience to arrange for specific emphasis, balanced lighting, and correction for distortion, etc., as needed. The Photographer II may use 16mm or 35mm motion picture cameras for simple shots such as moving equipment or individuals at work or meetings, where available or simple artificial lighting is used. Ordinarily, there is opportunity for repeated shots or for retakes if the original exposure is unsatisfactory. This Photographer consults with supervisor or photographers that are more experienced when problems are anticipated",

Typically, standard equipment is used at this level, although \"specialized\" photography can be performed using some special-purpose equipment under closer supervision. In typical assignments, the Photographer III photographs the following: (1) drawings, charts, maps, textiles, etc., requiring accurate computation of reduction ratios and exposure times and precise equipment adjustments; (2) tissue specimens in fine detail and exact color when color and condition of the tissue may deteriorate rapidly; (3) medical or surgical procedures or conditions which normally cannot be recaptured; (4) machine or motor parts to show wear or corrosion in minute wires or gears; (5) specialized real estate, goods and products for catalogs or listings when salability is enhanced by the photography; (6) work, construction sites, or patrons in prescribed detail to substantiate legal claims, contracts, etc.; (7) artistic or technical design layouts requiring precise equipment settings; and (8) fixed objects on the ground or air-to-air objects which must be captured quickly and require directing the pilot to get the correct angle of approach.

Typical examples of equipment used at this level include ultra-high speed, motion picture production, studio television, animation cameras, specialized still and graphic cameras, electronic timing and triggering devices, etc. Some assignments are characterized by extremes in light values and the use of complicated equipment. This photographer sets up precise photographic measurement and control equipment; uses high speed color photography, synchronized stroboscopic (interval) light sources, and/or timed electronic triggering; operates equipment from a remote point; or arranges and uses cameras operating at several thousand frames per second. In other assignments, selects and sets up motion picture or television cameras and accessories and shoots a part of a production or a sequence of scenes, or takes special scenes to be used for background or special effects in the production.
