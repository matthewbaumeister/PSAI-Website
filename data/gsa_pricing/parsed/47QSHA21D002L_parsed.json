Internal procedures and administrative controls are formal. An entire organization (e.g., division, subsidiary, or parent organization) may contain a variety of subordinate groups that meet the LS\u20102 definition. Therefore, it is not unusual for one LS\u20102 supervisor to report to another LS\u20102 supervisor.The presence of subordinate supervisors does not by itself, mean LS\u20102 applies. For example, a clerical processing organization divided into several units, each performing very similar work, is placed in LS\u20101. In smaller organizations or industries such as retail trades, with relatively few organizational levels, the supervisor may have an impact on the policies and major programs of the entire organization, and may deal with important outside contacts as described in LS\u20103.",

Asbestos abatement workers keep an eye on the air by putting on respirators to ensure that endurable quantities of asbestos particles are released. Workers must also be careful regarding personal safety as unhealthy and imprudent exposure to asbestos materials can prove to be detrimental leading to asbestos\u2010related diseases. They must use personal protective suits, disposable gloves, coveralls, safety glasses, face shields and ear guards. These workers often work under certified site supervisors. Asbestos abatement workers are required to abide by certain guidelines pertaining to hazardous waste handling norms. The technicians must be well conversant with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Workers are required to handle myriad varieties of heavy machineries like trucks and rigs, forklifts and earth\u2010moving machinery.",
