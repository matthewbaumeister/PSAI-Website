The system should likewise promote the productivity of the computer proficient subject matter expert (SME) research. Phase III of the system integration of technology prototyped in Phase II would produce a commercially viable product.","The ability to store, retrieve, and manipulate information represented as discrete, numerically based data structures has been the basis of most modern computer technology. Information that is financial, statistical, or hierarchically ordered lends itself well to this technology. Today’s Data Base Management System (DBMS) methodologies provide a rather complete suite of tools for the access and query of relatively homogeneous and structured information. Unfortunately, only a small portion of the information needed by HEL is in this form. Most information generated, utilized, and stored today is in textual format; and very little of that information lends itself to current DBMS technology. That part which is not consistent with DBMS methodologies must be reorganized, distilled, categorized, and reformatted by SMEs before it can be used, stored, and retrieved electronically. This textual information tends to be unstructured – often intermixed with numeric, graphical, or image data – and is characterized by heterogeneity in organization, format, and content. Textual databases are usually very large collections of information that frequently exceed the sizes handled by a DBMS. The recent development of affordable CD-ROM technology, fast computer processors, and reliable optical scanners has highlighted the scarcity of effective automated text retrieval technologies. The hardware side of this problem has been partially solved with off-the-shelf commercially available products. What remains is selection and/or modification of appropriate products and integration of these products into a seamless, integrated system that is compatible with advanced intelligent retrieval software. Software techniques which allow this hardware to perform in a manner which imitates the abilities of an expert human document researcher are being developed in academia and private industry. Both classical statistical and cognitive-based retrieval methodologies which mimic the way the human mind solves the text retrieval problem offer the best promise of effectively employing the power of today’s computer hardware in the pursuit of this problem. Examples of areas of high interest to HEL for textual retrieval research include but are not limited to: - Natural language processing - Vector and probabilistic modeling - Linear associative retrieval - Automatic classification - Phrase structure grammars - Automatic thesaurus construction - Transformational grammars - Criterion phrases - Boolean and p-norm models - Word stemming - Fuzzy logic Phase I: Technology Area Review/Analysis. Phase I will include a review/analysis of technology employing AI and/or other classical methods listed above that are being researched as well as those that are being used within academia and industry to address the automatic text retrieval problem. The results/utility of previous and ongoing government program should also be included. The overall objective of this review/analysis effort is to identify technologies which could be leveraged/adopted to form a potential state-of-the-art prototype system for demonstration in Phase II. In preparation for Phase II, Phase I should develop black and data flow diagrams describing applicable technology algorithms identified and include discussion of the potential algorithm/software technology shortfalls associated with adaptation/integration and potential work-arounds. A requisite for this Phase I effort would be the adoption of a sound method to evaluate the effectiveness/applicability of each technology review to the overall text retrieval problem. Phase II: Proof-of-Principle/Demonstration. The Phase II effort will take the technologies identified in Phase I; employ off-the-shelf hardware/software, and, where possible, demonstrate the AI-based technologies’/algorithms’ utility in forming a state-of-the-art automated text retrieval system prototype. As a minimum, the leveraged/adapted technology demonstrator must be able to handle free-form, natural language inquiries and automatically search and retrieve relevant text from a database of previously scanned and stored technical documents.

Interfaces for these systems have been developed under UNIX, the X Window System and Motif, to run on a Sun 4/260 workstation. The objective of this effort is to develop a general purpose, direct manipulation interface ""construction kit” and interface design environment based on UNIX, the X Window System and Motif standards. Specific areas of interest are: a. INPUT INTERFACES: The interface developer would use this environment to lay out and edit interface objects (windows, scroll boards, buttons, menus, icons, etc.) and give them specific attributes (color, size, position, etc). These objects would have methods to handle display, highlighting, resizing and other appropriate behaviors based on the X library and Motif. The interface design environment would also assist in the linking of functional code to the generated interface code. b. OUTPUT INTERFACES: Objects for the display of project planning output are required. Minimum requirements are the standard activity network type technical planning, tracking and monitoring structures, such as CPM, PERT, and WBS, for the display of the knowledge-based planners output. Desired features for the interface design environment include support for the generation of charts, histograms, comparison reports, project calendars, and what-if analysis to assist in customizing the planner output interfaces to the logistics domain. Phase I: Emphasis should be on application and extension of existing interface building tools which are fully compatible with UNIX, the X Window System and Motif standards. The work should include a serious effort at prototype development (bidders must have their own computing facility).

Remote driving of these vehicles can be automated through the use of computer-controlled path planning and execution programs. An additional complication is the requirement for use of a low datarate bandwidth to ensure secure communications and command and control on the battlefield. Current secure video links require that the operator attempt to drive using a very degraded image (the result of applying image compression techniques to reduce required bandwidth), resulting in very slo wand inaccurate deployment.

It can be made ductile through extensive mechanical working or by alloying. The alloying efforts have generally concentrated on the class of alloys known as tungsten heavy alloys (generally W-Ni-Fe). Among other uses for the tungsten heavy alloys is kinetic energy penetrators, used for the defeat of armors. But, it is generally known that in most cases the heavy alloys are inferior to penetrators made from depleted uranium (DU) alloys. It is desirable at this time to investigate the development of a tungsten based composite or heavy alloy that is not based on the current heavy alloy system.

They do not interface well with composite materials. Advanced composites can be delicate materials to fasten. Ordinary fasteners can damage the fibrous composite panels when installed. Creating a hole in fibrous composite materials can cause delaminations to the back or blind side of the panel, whereas metal materials tend to deform slightly without seriously diminishing their load carrying capabilities. This could result in fastener pull through in the composite. The pressure required during installation can cause buckling or delamination, and the problems that occur during use include edge delamination, crushing, or pull through. Most metals are not compatible with the carbon fibers so common in advanced composites, and therefore run the risk of galvanic corrosion. Metal fasteners must be made of titanium alloys, austenitic stainless steels, or Inconel, metals that are the most compatible with advanced composite materials. Not only is there a problem about what fasteners can do to composites, there is also a problem of what composites can do to fasteners. Abrasive fibers damage unprotected fasteners during repeated installation and removal cycles. Other problems with the current fastener systems on composite structure are: corrosion from the non-composite fastener, fastener mechanical failures, non-standardization of fastener sizes and lack of lightning strike ground capabilities. Developing a viable fastener system which will reduce the large number of fasteners and be compatible with composites, will save weight and money on the Army’s future aircraft. Phase I: The desired results of the Phase I effort are to make a field evaluation and literature survey of current production fasteners and evaluate materials for the design of a new fastener system to interface with composite structure. Candidate fastener design materials will be evaluated and tested for interface requirements with advanced composite materials. Coupon test with the proposed fastener material will be conducted. Phase II: The end result for this R&D program will include design, fabrication and test of an advanced application fastener system for composite aircraft structure. The selected system will represent an improvement over existing fastener systems in terms of acquisition and support costs and weight. The fastener system will be designed, fabricated and full-scale tested.

Many of the bearingless hub concepts use a composite flexbeam as the primary load transfer member between the rotor blade and the main rotor hub.

The requirement exists for a ground-based structural diagnostic tool to test the structural integrity of such a structural component without having to remove the pitch case. Embedded fiber optic sensors have the potential for meeting this requirement by placing a fiber optic sensor in a structure during the fabrication process.

The technology critical to FBL consists of basic fiber optic technology (critical to communicating control signals throughout the aircraft) and sensor technology (crucial to generating control signals). Government and industry have made substantial investments in basic fiber optic technology which has matured and is considered to be funded development programs, just recently matured to where producibility issues can be addressed. Current digital linear and rotary position sensors demonstrated in ADOCS are expensive to produce because hands-on labor intensive techniques, required to ensure adequate tension control of the fiber winds, are required to wind hair thin optical fibers around a mandrel (delay line assembly), which fits into the sensor body. Improper tension has a negative effect on sensor performance by producing excessive light loss in the fibers. This also increases the sensors sensitivity to temperature, since the fiber’s tension varies as the mandrel expands and contracts with temperature. The current labor intensive manufacturing techniques are economically inefficient and cannot support production of the large quantity of sensors necessary for FBL control systems. Thus, this program will try to solve these problems as described in Phase I and II below. Phase I: Design and develop a low cost, modular integrated fiber optic delay line assembly and transducer read ahead, for a twelve bit digital optical linear position transducer. The design must be easy and relatively cheap to manufacture.

In this instance it is desirable to develop a much smaller instrument which can be used beneath a road or airport pavement to determine the pressure at a selected ""point.” The currently available instruments are generally very ""stiff” or very ""compliant” and tend to concentrate or more widely disburse loadings causing inaccurate data to be obtained. Matching the modulus of the gage to that of the soil is necessary to minimize these problems, but in seasonal frost areas the modulus varies substantially depending upon whether the soil is frozen, thawing, thawed and not reconsolidated or thawed reconsolidated. The modulus of fine-grained soil may easily change three orders of magnitude during various stages of freezing and thawing. The ideal gage will be small, perhaps two inches in diameter by less than an inch thick, insensitive to temperature changes in the range of 0 F to 80 F, capable of measuring pressures in the range of 0.5 to 100.0 psiwith a resoluation of 0.1 psi and an accuracy of + or – 0.2 psi over the lower quarter or one-half of the pressure range and not more than + or – 0.5 psi over the upper one-half of the range.

Many cameras have hand operated character generators built into the cameras for time/data and titles, but this does not input other instrumented signals on a real-time basis. The instrumentation/interface should be small enough to be carried while operating a portable video system.

The past decade has clearly shown that not only is that approach not reasonably, but any high probability low intensity conflict will involve considerable fighting in urban areas. The recent fighting in the Philippines, Romania and Panama clearly show the tendency for urban areas to become the battleground of the future. The ability to create a topographic database for high resolution aerial photography over urban areas is very limited and largely a manual process. Those automated procedures that do exist, to extract evaluations to provide a topographic database, in a crisis response time frame, is badly needed. At a minimum, a wire frame model, over which high resolution aerial photography could be draped is required. More sophisticated data bases showing the position of roads, buildings, and associated descriptions would be highly desirable. Phase I: Provide a conceptual design and ETL laboratory demonstration of a methodology to generate an urban area topographic data base from high resolution aerial photography using a crisis scenario. The methodology is to be clearly documented including all relevant mathematics. Software is to demonstrate any high risk procedures. A wire-frame model over as a minimum. More sophisticated databases showing the location of roads, buildings, associated descriptions would be highly desirable. Phase II: Develop and delivery to the Government a developmental model with appropriate documentation for evaluation using live data. The entire process from photogrammetric source to a digital topographic data base (consisting at a minimum elevations but preferably feature data as well) will be evaluated.

With the incorporation of electronic fuzes and guidance system, and other sensitive hardware into todays ammunition, susceptibility is a major concern. In addition, there have been significant advances in the field of HPM. It is felt that HPM generators may create detonation and burnout problems for ammunition. Currently, it is not known to what level protection is provided to ammunition by the use of metal, plastic and fiber ammunition containers. It is theorized that metal containers should attenuate most of the EPM/EMI/HPM field, but there is concern about transmission through the gasket (closure) area. Due to the inherent characteristics of plastic and fiber materials used, it is possible that current containers will provide little or no protection against these fields. It must be determined to what level protection is being provided by the use of these materials in all the generic container designs currently being manufactured.

The current primer inspection operation is very labor intensive and the inspectors are constantly exposed to hazardous energetic material. Four to five operators are engaged in manually inspecting the primers in each charging wing. Each inspector manually dumps a box containing 1,416 primers into a tray and then orients the primers in one direction. After the primers have been oriented, the inspector looks for visual defects through a magnifying glass and culls the defective primers. Then the primer tray is covered and turned over, enabling the operator to inspected the other side of the primers. One box of primers is inspected in about three minutes. It is impossible to maintain a consistent standard of inspection since factors like operator skill, fatigue, emotional mood, and judgment influence the efficiency of this operation. Thus, there exists a lot of variation from inspector to inspector. Since there is no accurate way to determine that the proper amount of primer mix has been placed in the primer cup, it is up to each individual inspector to determine what constitutes a normal or light charge. The same is true with other defects: it is up to each inspector’s judgment. Testing conducted to-date shows that the efficiency of each operator decreases throughout the day due to fatigue and the conditioning effect of repetitive tasks. While the cost of an individual primer ranges from a fraction of a penny to a few cents per primer (depending on type), a malfunctioning primer either causes the complete round of ammunition to be useless or, in the case of a hangfire, it could prove to be potentially dangerous to the user. Thus, quality and safety are two factors of major concern in the manufacturing of primers. The current primer inspection operation at LCAAP is inadequate. The quantity of primers, the number of inspections per primer, and the size of the primers make the inspection operation difficult and inefficient. The inspection of small caliber ammunition is very subjective and highly dependent on the operators skills and experience. Some of the major and critical defects, i.e., too much shellac, light primer charge, are difficult if not impossible to consistently detect. As a result, defective primers may pass through the inspection operation undetected, later causing weapon and cartridge malfunctions. Phase I: Determine feasibility of utilizing existing or modified automated machine inspection systems to perform the required small caliber primer visual inspections, and to determine if the proper amount of primer mix is present in the primer.

Higher tungsten content alloys require higher temperature casts and these become more corrosive/erosive to the containment crucible and nozzle delivery system. Most standard ceramic materials for the containment crucible and nozzle have not been effective. Standard atomization approaches would also need to consider proper containment of the melt and controlled delivery. Rotating electrode schemes although doing away with the container, would need to dedicate a great deal of effort in fabricating the precursor electrodes. Modified ""skull casting” techniques adapted to a regulated dispensing of a molten stream may offer a potential solution. Innovative approaches are therefore sought to reliably exploit rapid solidification technology for high content (greater than 96 weight percent) tungsten alloys. Phase I: Develop a methodology for rapid solidification processing of high tungsten alloys. Utilizing various alloy compositions evaluate process characteristics and establish key parameter values to enable the reproducible production of research quantities of processed tungsten alloy powders.

Tracking filters for both fixed and rotary wing aircraft have already been developed that use attitude angles (yaw, pitch, roll) in addition to the usual radar measurements. Computer simulation of tracker performance when tracking violently maneuvering aircraft indicates that a dramatic improvement is obtained by using optically-derived attitude information. It is desired to develop a similar filter for ground vehicles and to test it against real targets, as well as to improve the performance of the aircraft trackers and test them against real targets. The development of an automatic target recognizer that will accurately determine target type and orientation is very important to this topic and may include techniques for global and partial shape recognition of three-dimensional objects by using two-dimensional exterior contour information, or recognition of three-dimensional objects by using three-dimensional surface information, or use of time-varying imagery to segment shape. Neural networks may prove useful here in hybrid combination with classical shape description methods.

The simulation should model, to a useful level of detail, the entire indirect fire process from location of a target, transmission of that information to a tactical fire control center, assignment of a fire mission to weapon(s), computation of the technical fire control data, laying of the weapon, flyout of the bullet to the target, and, finally, location of the impact with respect to the target. Using such a model, an investigator could determine the sensitivity of the weapon system performance to a large number of system parameters and external variables associated with fire control. Examples of such investigations are: investigation of the potential benefit of monitoring individual round muzzle velocity and the use of that data to correct the firing data for subsequent rounds; investigation of the potential benefit of monitoring individual round muzzle velocity and the use of that data to correct the firing data for subsequent rounds; investigation of the potential benefit of observation of the fired projectile’s flight path and application of correction to subsequent projectile based on the difference between the observed trajectory and expected sensitivity of the system performance to weapon location and alignment errors. The simulation should be capable of operation on an IBM compatible PC and should operate in a manner consistent with acceptable user friendly formats. It should be modular in construction so that portions can be modified and updated as necessary. It should contain adequate storage capacity so that a large number of real and conceptual fire control systems can be defined and stored for later use.

Develop some software to demonstrate sufficient features of the model to enable a Phase II decision to be made.

The resultant of this source of data is the ability to aim a weapon with a much higher degree of accuracy, thus substantially increasing the hit probability of a gunner’s system. Currently, main gun muzzle position is measured by conducting a measurement of the muzzle position using a manual Muzzle Reference Sensor (MRS) and comparing them to a reference position achieved by going through a boresight procedure. Various attempts at improving the existing manual reference sensor have achieved a tremendous increase in the ability of the MRS to survive the harsh muzzle environment, but have done little towards meeting main gun accuracy requirements. In view of the above, the time is appropriate to fully integrate an AMRS device into the Fire Control System, providing the ballistic computer with an automatic update of muzzle orientation before each bullet is fired (and possibly gather information as the bullet is traveling along the tube) and to further integrate the primary sight into the AMRS loop by referencing the end of the muzzle to the main sight. Phase I: Develop concepts and projected performance for integration of an Automatic Muzzle Reference Sensor into the Fire Control System (sight and Ballistic Computer) on an M1A1 vehicle. This will provide the ability of the ballistic computer of interpret the muzzle orientation data from the AMRS, and to process the data through the ballistic solution so that the proper rectile offset by projected on the primary sight. Phase II: Implement the system developed in Phase I and integrate it into the Gunner’s Primary Sight (GPS) on an M1A1 vehicle.

The Army’s mandate for the use of the Ada programming language and the desire to reap cost benefits through the reuse of software has placed additional concerns on the development of embedded real-time software systems which already has inherent performance requirements. By distributing these types of software programs to increase performance, more complexity has been added to the already difficult processing of insuring that the program’s tasks complete their work in their allotted time. The Ada scheduler, contained in the runtime environment, controls and resolved task execution and intertask communication conflicts so that the real-time system con produce correct results within its time constraints. The Ada language provides a very limited ability, through the selection of eligible tasks according to priority, to explicitly control the runtime scheduling of tasks. Many scheduling algorithms now being developed require more scheduling control than that provided by the Ada tasking model. Also since scheduling algorithms are very complex or are application specific, it is unlikely that complier vendors will be able to support very many of them in the foreseeable future in the Ada runtimes that they provide. Therefore, application specific scheduler components, implementing particular scheduling algorithms, that could be inserted into a Ada runtime are needed. These components would provide the scheduling that is appropriate for a particular application to guarantee its timing requirements. These components would be adaptable to some degree and be interchangeable to reusable in other applications. They would also be reusable with a variety of compilers. Having them would provide a viable approach to meeting the time constraints and performance requirements of real-time systems. This research will work toward developing a set of reusable scheduler components. It will also specify a flexible, efficient, and reusable interface to allow insertion of components into a runtime environment and to provide the ability to adapt and reuse them. In addition, this research will seek to develop the specification of a prototype tool that could aid in the adaptation of a particular scheduler component and facilitate its incorporation into the runtime environment for a particular software application There are numerous emerging scheduling techniques that need to be examined, such as earliest deadline, prioritized with preemption, and priority inheritance. Variations of them and the ease of adapting them also needs to be addressed, such as modifying simple priority inheritance to full transitive priority inheritance for a particular application. There are algorithms that can support distributed processing implementations of Ada which also need to be addressed. Questions to be answered include: what is the necessary set of components that must be considered for the scheduler set? How could these components be made portable over various runtime implementations and reusable over different applications on the same runtime implementation; what are the runtime interface considerations that must be addressed? How can the performance of the components be specified so they are able to be reused with confidence in these specifications?

The objective is to establish or determine each systems’ performance limitations or vulnerability when exposed to existing and/or postulated EW threat environments. The EW environments consist of active and passive countermeasures (ECM). A systems’ EW vulnerability can be reduced by the incorporation of electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) into the system to harden it against hostile EW. Electronic support measures (ESM) are an integral part of the total EW picture. ESM are used to detect, locate and identify systems on a modern battlefield. The US Army vulnerability assessment (EWVA) program seeks technological advances in the ECM, ECCM, and ESM areas as well as innovative techniques and diagnostic tools that can be applied in the determination/assessment of system EW vulnerability. The US Army’s EWVA program requires applicable advances in the electromagnetic (EM) technology areas in the following portions of the EM spectrum: acoustic, visible, millimeter wave (MMW), radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV). Multispectral systems operating in two or more of the above spectral bands are emerging on the modern battlefield. Technological advances in the development of broadband EMC, ECCM and ESM are required. Multispectral Sensor Technology needs to be developed to permit simultaneous operation across RD, MMW and IR-UV wavelengths. Unique, realistic and more efficient approaches in the establishment of the systems’ EW vulnerability are required for the theoretical, laboratory and field investigations. A multispectral simulator utilizing automatic target recognition technology is required to assess multi sensor systems. The simulator must have the capability to generate scenes with backgrounds, targets and countermeasures in multispectral regions to include MMW, far IR and television wavelengths. There are requirements to address advanced multispectral passive ECM, low observables and smart munitions ECM techniques. For ECM purposes, ""tailoring” of the multispectral signatures of military targets such as missiles, aircraft, ground vehicles, artillery and high value assets should be addressed. Smart munitions ECM techniques must be as broadband as possible to minimize the cost of applying them to a wide variety of munitions currently undergoing development. Electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM) advances are required in both decoy and jammer categories. Advances are required in spectrally tailored IR and UV sources that can provide higher output radiation power levels with reduced weight, physical size and input power requirements. Advances in jammer modulation techniques (to frequencies as high as 5 KHZ) that can provide programmable waveform shapes as well as CW waveforms from unmodulated constant level outputs are required. ECCM technology advances are required for electro-optical (EO) devices. These ECCM techniques will be used to counter the ECM effects of lasers and RF against EO devices. The importance of very fast optical switches that are responsive to frequency agile lasers should be stressed. Optical switches should respond to very low level intensities. Emphasis should be on IR, television (TV), nightsights, UV systems and the human eye. EO devises must also be hardened to protect them from performance degradation and/or damage from RF sources. ECCM technology to protect multispectral sensors is required to prevent RF penetration of sensitive electronics while minimizing the effects on the transmission of desired EO signals. There is a trend in the development of new weapon systems based on directed energy technology: high power microwave (HPM), high energy laser, particle beams, kinetic energy weapons, etc. Advances are required in EW techniques to counter their effects, sensors and fire control systems. These sensors include both active and passive systems. The sensors are expected to operate in the microwave through the UV regions of the EM spectrum. Advances in EW techniques are required to defeat these sensors to include search acquisition, track, discrimination, fire control and kiss assessment. ECCM technology development for hardening against directed energy weapons (DEW) will be required. Near term ECCM technology for protection of US systems against high energy lasers and HPM should be addressed. Far term efforts are required to develop technology for hardening against particle beams. An important area in assessing the EW vulnerability of systems is the ability to perform accurate EW signature measurements across the EM spectrum. Advances are needed in target signature measurement technology that will not only provide comprehensive accurate data, but also minimize the time and cost in making the measurements.",713,4880,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66477/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66477/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:30:52,,,,,A91-017_66477,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C1_A91-017,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:43.150399+00

Initial research should address innovative approaches for effective and practical ANC when the weapon platform is in operation and the vehicle is stationary with the engine on.

Consequently, there is considerable interest in use of consolidated, bonded and unified charges of various fluid propellants (liquid, gel, emulsion and slurry propellants) and new solid propellants. High energy propellants are constantly sought for existing traditional weapons systems and for liquid propellants (LP) gun systems including regenerative and bulk loaded systems. In addition a new technology is evolving, electrothermal chemical (ETC) propulsion, which demands high energy density propelling charges for effective application in viable systems. The propellants developed along with their resulting propelling charges must fulfill requirements which are system dependent and sometimes unique. For example, a traditional solid propellant gun system may require a propellant which has a high energy density coupled with low flame temperature while a liquid propellant gun or an ETC gun might have a different set of requirements. This increased energy density, however, can result in instabilities which run counter to the need for reproducibility of performance at accepted levels. Based on experimental evidence, much can be done to alleviate these problems. For example, careful tailoring of the ignition system (e.g. pyrotechnic, electric, laser, plasma, etc) can do much toward achieving an effective ballistic system. New high energy density propellants and high performance propelling charges need to be developed. In addition, analytical and experimental efforts in the fundamental study of ignition and combustion characteristics of the newly developed high energy density propellants must be carried out. Phase I: Develop new families of high energy density propellants which will be candidates for high performance propelling charges.

If this technical areas can be integrated with appropriate environmental sensor and applied to control physical system on the Advance self-propelled howitzer, a major step towards AFAS goals for personnel reduction, as well as improved reliability, availability and maintainability will be achieved. However, to achieve the goals, further R&D is needed to advance the method of reasoning about kinematic and dynamics of controlled devices/processes as their operational characteristics undergo structural change. For example, continuous use of the system develops wear on some mechanical elements which in turn, causes an increase in ""back lash” that results in a qualitative change in operating behavior. Thu, the change might cause the device to move improperly and cause a malfunction. The system’s performance may be altered significantly as the environment in which it operates changes. For example, an automatic device may perform well when the self-propelled vehicle is at rest and poorly when the platform is in motion. Thus, the utilization of machine learning to monitor and update the device’s model and employ qualitative reasoning about possible future performances faults should be investigated. Qualitative reasoning about the system’s performance characteristics depends not only on kinematic/dynamic behavior of mechanisms but the integrity of signal inputs to the controller that monitors the behavior. Thus if a sensor is faulty, the data it generates may lead to incorrect conclusions. To avoid this type of flaw, the intelligent controller must reason about its performance. Thus, it is important that the research address a range of issues related to data/sensors fusion and fault diagnosis.

Initial pilot scale work has been very promising. Also, academic studies are being conducted to develop rheological data and to establish models with which to design and scale up from the pilot plant work. Indications from these studies are that the shear rates obtained in these machines are much higher than those experienced in batch mixers.

No new advances in pyrotechnic technology have been made to keep pace with the advanced fighting systems that have been or will be developed and fielded in the future. The newest small arms system, the 5.56 mm Squad Automatic Weapon (SAAW), with its extremely high spin rate (>300,000 rpm) is required to provide a 900 meter day and night trace capability when firing the M856 tracer cartridge. The users have in the past expressed dissatisfaction with the daylight luminosity levels of the M856, desiring visibility closer to that achievable with the larger caliber 7.62 mm M62; however, current tracer fuel/oxidizer compositions fail to provide the desired characteristics of long range and high day luminosity. Basic exploratory development of new tracer chemistry for small arms applications is needed. New systems which may be fielded in the future will consist of subcaliber projectiles with extremely small tracer orifice openings and volumes. In addition, they will have shorter times of flight due to their high velocities. These projectiles which will fly farther will require pyrotechnic compositions that burn longer and brighter than is currently possible within the state of the art. Phase I: Initiate a search for new approaches to tracer technology. This will consist of identifying and evaluating new technologies for light production which could be applied to the development of pyrotechnic compositions. Candidate compositions or technologies will be formulated and loaded into simulated projectiles and evaluated in a test fixture at different spin rates for brightness and burn rate. From the results obtained several candidate compositions will be chosen for evaluation in Phase II. In addition, for each new composition, a process for formulation and blending would be provided. Phase II: Candidate compositions for Phase one will be charged into representative projectiles of several different calibers. The projectiles would then be loaded into cartridges and fired from a weapon. The results of these firing s would be analyzed in order to assess trace quality, duration and luminosity; and recommendations made as to their suitability for use as a tracer composition.",351,2281,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65179/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65179/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:31:00,,,,,A91-039_65179,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C2_A91-039,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:43.150399+00

Such inspection systems need to be able to efficiently convert high energy x-rays in a real time to a digital format with high spatial (2-dimensional image) and high density resolution. For such energy ranges, the current technology generally involves the use of a scintillator followed by an image intensifier and finally a camera with digital output. Such a system suffers from degradation over time of the scintillator, requires removing the camera from the x-ray beam, and generally results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. This solicitation is for the development of high efficiency, high resolution sensors for converting x-rays, whose energy range is from 300 KV to 1 MV, into a digital output with improved efficiency over that of current methods.

This may be done through monolithic design. Intelligent combinations of the radiating aperture, the feed network, and the phasing scheme within a monolithic arrangement can lead to lower cost antennas, particularly at millimeter wavelengths. Reduced complexity is possible by reduction of the number of individual phase shifters that are normally associated with each radiating element. The objective of the SBIR is to investigate concepts which would use presently available material technologies and select one of those concepts which will result in the fabrication of a practical monolithic antenna structure for Phase II. Wide-angle electronically scanned phased array antennas typically use one phase shifter per radiating element. This results in increased cost, primarily due to the cost of the phase shifter.

Databases do not normally provide information within the time-critical constraints that are inherent in a real-time system. Object-oriented approaches to database implementation could provide a better response time but have not matched well with the Ada language. The objective of this effort is to develop the technology necessary to effectively combine Ada program and objective-oriented databases.","Software is a major component of most tactical army systems currently in the field or in development. The Army’s mandate for the use of the Ada programming language and the parallel emergence of object-oriented concept and methods in the development of software applications has caused concern about the effective combination of the Ada and object-oriented programming Further constraints are imposed by the time-critical and performance requirements of embedded real-time software systems. These software systems are complex and many are distributed. Future generations of real-time Army systems will also have to be increasingly intelligent One approach for Ada real-time applications to use object-oriented databases is to have an Ada interface to an object-oriented database that would allow the application to access the information in the database. This interface would need to provide fast response to rapidly changing data and a method to eliminate the critical bottleneck that can occur when attempting to access or update stored data. It also has to be portable so it can be used by different Ada applications needing to access various object-oriented databases. However, the overhead and effect on performance incurred by having an additional layer introduced needs to be addressed. Approaches to crating this interface and making it portable could include the development of tools to assist in the process. Specific topics to be addressed include: the characteristics and requirements of real-time databases, such as data becoming inconsistent without updates and deadlines associated with transaction to maintain temporal consistency; analysis and characteristics of existing object oriented databases; the Ada 9X language revision that may address object-oriented concept and Ada; and approaches to combine the two technology areas with the resultant problems and benefits. Phase I: this research will analyze the issues involved in integrating real-time Ada applications and object-oriented databases. It will propose a solution that will answer as a minimum the issues described in this solicitation. Phase II: A prototype of the proposed solution will be implemented, evaluated, and tested for validity and ability to address the issues",334,2253,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65201/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65201/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:31:07,,,,,A91-060_65201,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C2_A91-060,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:43.150399+00

The subject software asset could be coded modules, software designs, requirements, or any other artifact of the software development process.","Software reuse has the potential for reducing the effort, and related cost, necessary to develop new C3I software. There are costs associated with reuse that include: development of reusable assets; incorporation of the asset into the proposed software; and determination of what appropriate assets are available. The ability to quantify the reusability of a software asset will aid in making decisions concerning which assets are available for use. A quantified means of measuring reusability can help potential re-users in determining the amount of effort needed to reuse an asset. The more reusable an asset, the less effort required to use it. Other possible uses of such a set of metrics includes determining the changes needed to improve the reusability of a software asset, and selection of assets for software libraries. The proposer should identify the characteristics which affect or influence the potential reusability of a software asset, and the related evaluation criteria or indicators, the associated values for these indicators, and different approaches for measuring these indicators with automated tools. Phase I: Phase I will concentrate on defining and describing the indicators to be measured, their values and the preferred measurement method.

Disposable insertion strips will distinguish major groups of microorganisms based on a common inter-group characteristic for each major category.,"Currently, there is a need to assess the presence of bacterial pathogens in an aerosol, in contaminated water, or in a biological warfare gent chemical cloud. There are no easily transportable devices that would allow a soldier to obtain such information. Biochemical sensors have been constructed using immobilized enzyme systems which function when the transfer of an electron is converted into an electrochemical signal and displayed by a hand-held sensor. Glucose determinations can be made this way by using the ExacTek system. The recent discovery and isolation of bacterial enzyme systems and cytochrome enzyme systems, which function by the transfer of electrons from one to several compounds, has opened new possibilities for detecting and monitoring reactions occurring in biological systems. A scheme for such a system, to detect and separate major categories of microorganisms, will provide the theoretical basis for construction of a universal electrochemical sensing device which will read all signals. Phase I: Wok during Phase I should center around establishing a theoretical basis for recognition of spores, viral particles, bacteria, amoeba, and fungi using unique electron transfer reactions. A disposable strip, specific for each group, will be designed to generate the same end result and be read in the universal sensor. Thus, the identity of groups will be designated by the disposable strip itself. For example, a strip containing an enzyme system which will detect a component found in fungi cell walls, such as sterols, which are not found in any other group, will be inserted in the device and read. If a negative reading is obtained, then each of the other three strips are inserted, inoculated, and read. The system will be designed to detect a threshold number of particles, significantly above background, to avoid an unacceptable number of false positive reactions. Phase II: Phase II should see the successful proof of concept of reactions developed in Phase I as they are transferred to a read device. This device will be small enough to be carried in a shirt pocket, along with a packet of disposables.

For current systems to detect a liquid, the contaminant must have a sufficient volatility to produce a measurable concentration in the air above the surface. Persistent threat agents and solid contaminants have every low vapor pressures, however, making their detection problematic. The advantages of an optical detection technique over current vapor sensing schemes would include the direct detection of the liquid or solid contaminant on the surface as well as freedom from memory effects that result when the sample must be ingested into the detector. Raman scattering has been used to remotely detect species in the atmosphere at part per million (ppm) levels. At a distance of 1 kilometer or greater, however, high energy pulsed lasers and large diameter collection optics are required. Because of the signal dependence on one over the square of the distance from target to observer, a factor of 100 million improvement in sensitivity is realized for detection at 10 cm as compared to detection at 1 km. Calculations using laboratory measurements of chemical agent Raman scattering cross section indicate that the detection of agents on surfaces is possible with laser powers less than 50 mW. With the recent advanced in array detectors, and diode lasers, construction of a sensitive and compact Raman based detector appears feasible. In addition to its military role of monitoring and control of chemical warfare agent contamination, such a system would be applicable to the rapid identification of chemical spills a chemical plants, land fills, etc. Phase I: The goal of the Phase I study will be to determine the feasibility of developing a compact Raman spectroscopy system capable of detecting liquid and solid contaminant on surfaces at coverages of approximately 1 gram per square meter. The system design produced in Phase I will contain specific information on components as well as total size, weight, and power requirements. The decision to move into Phase II will be based on the perceived utility of the Raman detection system as designed.

Current optical techniques including laser induced fluorescence (LIF) and Raman scattering (CARS and SRS) offer promise for the measurement of fluctuating density, temperature, and species concentration since these techniques are non-intrusive and have been used in a supersonic wind tunnel environment to determine mean values for the above properties. Unfortunately, current laser techniques do not work well in most high supersonic wind tunnels because of the low static pressures, low static temperatures, and high stagnation temperatures in the test section; temperature distortion and abrasion of test section windows; and the high vibration environment surround the tunnel. Furthermore, modest laser pulse rates and low response signals have precluded the determination fluctuating properties even at low supersonic mach numbers.

These subsystems impose sever power and cooling requirements on both the MBU and OCU. Studies have indicated that a tradeoff involving operation capabilities is necessary because conventional systems cannot provide the needed power and cooling and remain within size and weight constraints. To improve upon this, more efficient and economical techniques of supplying electrical power and subsystem cooling must be identified. This is necessary because of the limited amount of power and space available. Phase I: During the initial phase, the contractor will evaluate various MBU and OCU configuration to determine representative power and cooling requirements. The contractor will identify critical technologies and develop a range of feasible concepts which address these requirements. The contractor will document all work performed under Phase I in a final report and include research methods, technical work description and results, and concept drawings. Phase II: During this phase, the contractor will fabricate and test a prototype of the leading concept based on Phase I results. The prototype will be tested with actual MBU and OCU subsystems to verify performance.

Current Army efforts are focused on the Regenerative Liquid Propellant Gun (RLPG) for potential application in the Advanced Field Artillery System (AFAS). However, the BLPG, which is a less complex embodiment of the basic LP gun concept would be a more attractive candidate for small and medium caliber applications if the basic ballistic control problems were resolved. In addition to being less complex than the RLPG, the bulk loaded LP concepts offers the potential for reduced gun size and weight, higher rates of fire and increased gun performance for a given gun volume (even over conventional solid propellants). A variety of mechanical and hydrodynamic approaches for controlling the BLPG interior ballistic process have been proposed in the past. Liquid propellants offer the potential for reduced logistics burden, reduced cost and reduced combat vehicle vulnerability while increasing safety throughout the system. Successful development of a bulk loaded LP concept for small and medium caliber cannons could increase the overall logistic and cost benefits of fielding a liquid propellant system and could find application in infantry fighting vehicles, aircraft cannon, and vehicle secondary armament as well as small arms.

Current approaches are limited to combustion in the chamber which limits the ballistic efficiency at high velocity. Releasing the chemical energy closer to the projectile is one approach for increasing performance. An alternative approach is based on the traveling charge concept. This approach has been extensively studied both in liquid and solid propellants; the results indicate that performance gains of 10 to 15% are possible. Limitations of this approach are the difficulties in igniting the propellant at the optimum time, requirements for modifying the projectile, and the parasitic mass required to confine the propellant. Down barrel injection avoids these limitations. This method had been considered earlier in bulk loaded liquid propellant gun programs, however analysis to support possible increased performance was not performed. Since the technology of ignition and combustion of liquid propellants has significantly advanced during the last decade, a re-examination of down barrel injection may be warranted. Phase I: Demonstrate analytically that the desired performance increase of 25% is possible. Perform parametric sensitivity to determine the overall sensitivity of the process, with a focus on timing and energy release rate of the injected propellant. The result should be an analysis that identifies the conditions required for optimizing the interior ballistic performance. It is envisioned that a 2-D analysis would be required to describe the down barrel injection and flow processes. Volume of liquid, local gas generation rates at the injector, and the location for the release of energy should be identified. Phase II: Demonstrate in 3O-mm firings both a 25% increase in performance and control of the interior ballistics. It is envisioned that liquid propellant would be used for the down barrel injection.

The requirement would be to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach and to demonstrate that performance, both in velocity and repeatability, can be achieved in a bulk loaded liquid propellant gun which is comparable to solid propellant guns. Phase I: Review concepts for identifying approaches which might apply to the above description. Interior ballistic codes, such IBHV2, would be used to define the required boundary size and to determine the conditions that would yield the desired performance.

The oscillations may have a serious impact on sensitive projectiles and may increase heat transfer and erosion. Because of their potential seriousness, programs have been proposed for studying both methods for suppressing the oscillations and approaches for studying their effect on the weapon system. One approach which has successfully eliminated all pressure oscillations, tested at Sandia National Laboratory in a vented vessel with propellant injected into the chamber, involved the use of a high pressure hydraulic hose. Although not practical for development for gun use, the liner does suggest an approach which might be effectively utilized for use in regenerative guns. Phase I: Perform an analysis of the acoustical impedance match between the gun chamber and the wall. The result should be the determination of the properties of a material which would absorb pressure oscillations and which would be suitable for use in the high temperature and high pressure environment of regenerative guns. Mechanisms by which the pressure oscillations may possibly be eliminated include absorption and wave cancellation. The former is the likely mechanism for the elimination of the waves in the tests performed at Sandia National Laboratory. The latter has been successfully used in rocket motors by the use of quarter wave dampers and Helmholtz resonators. These rocket approaches, however, are not consider practical for regenerative guns. A laminated material, on the other hand, with appropriate impedance matches at the layered boundaries, might serve the same purpose as a quarter wave damper. An alternate approach which might also be feasible would be the use a single material to absorb the waves.

Significant progress in fundamental understanding of boundary layer dispersion should result from a capacity to measure and analyze the spatial and temporal distributions of velocity, temperature, and moisture at scales of tens of meters and tens of seconds. Some of the progress envisioned by such a capability could be realistic sub-grid scale parameterizations for numerical models; understanding of the predictability of atmospheric turbulence; improved flux parameterizations; objective predictors of spatial intermittency; and assessment of the role of terrain in the dispersion process.

Smart materials and structures make use of the unique ability of materials to change properties in response to different stimuli. Typically, electrorheological fluids, piezoelectric materials, and shape memory alloys respond to changes in electric currents, electric fields, and temperature respectively. The integration of these sensors and actuators with computational/control capabilities enables smart materials/structures to provide ""intelligent"" responses including adapting, self diagnosis, life prediction, and self repair. An important concern of smart materials and structures is the temperature limitation of the sensors and actuator materials. For example, shape memory materials composed of nickel-titanium alloys have practical phase transitions below a temperature of 200°C. In addition, a need exist to develop thermal management control to improve the frequency response of shape memory alloys.

Long-life, energy-conserving power sources are envisioned to cost effectively replace expensive, throwaway lithium batteries for operating C31 systems in dynamic Army 21 battle scenarios. Notional Superconducting Magnetic Energy Power Sources (SMEPS) are based on the novel concept of storing large amounts of energy in the magnetic field of a superconducting inductive coil. The high energy coil, in conjunction with appropriate energy conversion and electronic power conditioning circuitry, produces a stable power supply. Electrical output characteristics are compatible with C31 user equipment normally powered by electrochemical batteries. Phase I: The purpose of Phase I investigation is to develop design concepts for a flux pump for charging superconducting coils to high circulating current levels. The total energy in a charged coil being proportional to the inductance of the coil and the magnitude of the circulating current, high energy storage (K joules) in a small coil requires high current levels (K amps). Production of high current levels from power/current limited military power sources requires amplification of the current capacity of the power source. A flux pump is a conceptual device that can achieve current amplification by inserting incremental flux pulses into the total flux in a coil in a periodic manner. In recent years, several schemes have been advanced by means of which flux may be introduced into a closed superconducting loop. Such developments have made flux pumping, that is, the accumulation of flux by its addition in increments, possible. Phase II: Characteristics of the flux design concepts identified in Phase I will be analyzed to determine feasibility and compatibility with the requirements of high energy coil designs being investigated for Superconducting Magnetic Energy Power Sources for military use. The study will include analysis of the physical and electrical characteristics and performance capabilities of superconducting switches which are basic components of flux pumping systems.

This process operates under pressures (- 10-4 torr) which are an order of magnitude lower than even the magnetron ion etching (MIE) process; this allows for the etching of very small features because the lower pressure helps the reacted gas to escape from, and the new etch gas to get into, the very narrow etched wells.

Chemical polishing is a common procedure in the manufacture of quartz resonators, however, its use is limited by the channels formed when the dislocations are selectively etched. These etch channels reduce the p, the yields during fabrication, and can lower the mechanical strength of the finished blanks. Sweeping (electrodiffusion) removes the atoms that decorate the dislocations and reduces the number of etch channels formed during processing, but it does not remove the dislocations. The effects of dislocations on resonator performance are less obvious than the effects of etch channels. The requirements on resonator specifications have tightened over the years. Research on the acceleration sensitivity of quartz resonators has shown that the placement of the vibrational modes is critical and that the mode shape and position can be distorted by the presence of dislocations. In other resonator instabilities (like hysteresis and aging), circumstantial evidence is increasingly pointing toward defects, such as dislocations, as being important contributing factors. Past efforts at reducing etch channel density have attempted to grow quartz in silver lined vessels and to slow the growth rate. These have had limited success. This program is intended to explore new and innovative approaches to significantly reduce the dislocation density in quartz.

About 3 orders of magnitude less power is required to upset or temporarily disrupt the function of the target's electronics. A DEW capable of generating GW power levels would be very heavy (multi-ton), expensive and require protection as heavy capital equipment. An alternative strategy is to use an expendable source that can be delivered by an artillery shell and placed in direct vicinity of the target. Significantly less energy is required by this strategy because the l/R2 range decay and atmospheric absorption drastically reduces the energy on target. The artillery shells with the PFN can be leisurely charged from a truck battery and trickled charged until launched. The PFN would store GW of peak power and kilowatts (kW) of average power in a standard 155 mm artillery shell and deliver hundreds of pulses on the target before it exhausts the energy supply. An important point is that this method of deployment leaves the prime power source (batteries) behind and converts the DC stored energy to RF energy directly over the target. Some important applications are to disable incoming missiles, disable C3I installations prior to attack, disengage a homing missile, frustrate fire control systems of unidentified aircraft and defense against terrorist attack (disable their electronic systems without harming hostages).

The modulator should be capable of sweeping over the entire frequency range at a 10 kHz rate. The RF input signal to the modulator will be < 0 dBm.

One such modulation scheme involves amplitude modulating the laser light, with the frequency of the modulation varying from 50 MHz to 400 MHz. This modulation scheme allows the detection of the target, and also gives information I about both target speed and range. To implement this scheme it is necessary to construct a laser I modulator with a bandwidth of 350 MHz which is flat over the frequency range mentioned above. The modulation waveform can be either sinusoidal or square, but the waveform must be consistent over the frequency range. The modulator should be capable of sweeping over the entire frequency range at a 10 kHz rate. The RF input signal to the modulator will be < 0 dBm. The RF input impedance of the modulator should be 50 Ohms. The input power supply voltage cannot exceed 100 V DC at 5W, -15 V at 2.5 W. The modulator should be integral to the laser diode chip, with both the laser diode chip and the modulator mounted in the same package. The maximum acceptable package size would be comparable to a TO-3 package. It is envisioned that the laser light output would be modulated by modulating the laser drive current, but a modulator using electroptic techniques is acceptable if it fits the above specifications. Phase I: Consists of the design of a modulator for cw laser diodes with optical powers of around 30 m Wand around 90 mW. The light frequency of the laser diodes could be in the Si detector region of the spectrum for overall system efficiency or at longer wavelengths for eye safety requirements. The 90 mW laser diode can be a series of closely spaced laser diode active regions such as the Sharp LTO90MD diode. Phase II: Consists of the integration, packaging, and testing of the laser diode modulators with the laser diode chips.",,0,0,0,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65474/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65474/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:31:43,,,,,A91-156_65474,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C2_A91-156,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:43.801478+00

These shielded cables are subjected to harsh operating environment and abuse and are known to degrade with time. Maintenance testing of single cable lengths as a two port distributed parameter network will provide the impedance transfer junction which is then tractable for frequency anomaly analysis. Multi-branched/multiwire shielded cables introduce an order of complexity since the problem becomes one of multi-port network analysis with termination into mismatched loads. The problem is further compounded when multi twisted wire lengths, both shielded and/or insulated, are introduced. The technical approach to this problem could include, but need not be limited to, the use of time domain reflectrometry, development of transfer functions including the transfer impedance, singularity expansion method, pole/zero resonance characterization, Thevenin equivalent, N-Port network representations, transmission line analysis, and antenna analysis concepts. The analytical development should provide guidance and understanding to the main objective of developing a quantitative testing procedure for determining/assessing cable degradation. It is expected that for large complex cables with multiple branching and many internal components that statistical concepts/analysis will be used in the characterization to keep the amount of test data/measurements tractable. The statistics might be employed to develop envelopes of measurable parameters, or threshold values in either the time or frequency domains, that would identify the onset/presence of cable degradation.

The application of image analysis techniques during mechanical testing has been shown to facilitate test automation and to provide information essential to the interpretation and quantification of mechanical test data. However, fracture processes are often complex and may extend over large regions of test specimens. Test specimens may have different sizes, shapes, colors and fracture characteristics which further complicate image analysis. Also, since fracture is a dynamic process, real-time (high speed) image acquisition and special image processing techniques are needed to determine specimen size and shape changes, identify where fracture is initiated, and describe how fracture develops in specimens during mechanical testing. Images must be classified and interpreted in terms of appropriate fracture models to facilitate the analysis of mechanical test data and provide a quantitative assessment of damage. By combining visual information with mechanical test data (applied stresses, strain, strain rate, fatigue cycle, creep time, etc.) and related experimental information (e.g., infrared thermography and acoustic emission), improved ;1 fracture models and a better understanding of mechanical failure processes in complex materials, such as polymer composites, will be possible.

When the performance of these alloys is compared, in the long rod configuration, the DU penetrators always penetrate further. The reason for this better performance has been attributed to the favorable conditions for adiabatic shear in the DU alloy. It has been shown that the nose of the DU penetrator ""self-sharpens"" and maintains a chisel nose that keeps the diameter of the penetration hole at a minimum. On the other hand, tungsten heavy alloys do not shoe this type of behavior. The heavy alloys, during penetration, tend to form mushroom noses that act to increase the penetration hole diameter causing a premature dissipation of the kinetic energy. The principal materials variables that affect the formation of adiabatic shear bands are: the rate of thermal softening, the rate of strain hardening, strain rate hardening, the thermal properties and the microstructural stability. In depleted uranium alloys used for penetrators these properties are in the correct balance to form adiabatic shear bands at the strain rates encountered in the penetration event. They are not advantageous for tungsten heavy alloy matrix. But to further complicate matters, the tungsten grains may act to blunt the adiabatic shear band and it may be required that the tungsten grains be smaller than the width of the shear band that forms. Phase I: The effort in Phase I should concentrate on identifying matrix materials that will form adiabatic shear bands at the strain rates of ballistic interaction. It should be demonstrated that these materials form the shear bands and, further, these materials must be compatible with the tungsten heavy alloy System concept.

Strain gages can only be used to measure local strain in a temperature below 1000 degrees F, while clip gage measure average strain quasistatically in a somewhat higher temperature. In any case, strain field in specimens/structures subjected to high strain rate and high heating rate cannot be experimentally determined with any degree of accuracy. The objective of this effort is to develop a device to measure a whole strain field on surfaces of specimens/structures subjected to high strain rate and high heating rate. The suggested approach is to develop non-contact (most likely optical device) strain measuring device for use at high strain rate and temperature rate. It is known that materials behave differently when they are subjected to various loading (heating rates); therefore, it is necessary to perform experiments under such environment to determine material responses. The most difficult problem in performing such experiments is to measure the strain. All current strain measuring devices require a direct contact with the specimen/structure; this requirement limits the use of such devices because the integrity of the devices themselves must be maintained during the experimentation. Furthermore, the devices must have a fast response to record all information in less than 10 milliseconds. In summary, the strain measuring device must be a non-contact one and have a fast response.

Recent progress in analyzing and predicting these complex aerodynamic phenomena on rigid blades by modern CFD methods has been promising, but nothing has been done to couple these advanced codes with structural dynamic methodology for the elastic blades that are actually used on modern helicopters. Furthermore, the complex interdisciplinary nature of rotorcraft, which encompasses aerodynamic, structural dynamic, flight controls, and propulsion, has inhibited the development of comprehensive tools to accurately predict important rotorcraft characteristic. The Army has undertaken the development of advanced CFD codes for nonlinear aerodynamic of rotor blades, to remove the limitations of approximate theories, and the development of a Second Generation Comprehensive Helicopter Analysis System (2GCHAS), to overcome the deficiencies earlier comprehensive analyses have. The 2GCHAS System is designed to evolve in a modular fashion as new technology becomes available. The initial System uses conventional aerodynamic technology, but the full potential of future supercomputers for rotorcraft applications will not be realized until advanced CFD methods are integrated into 2GCHAS. The integration will require careful analysis of the 2GCHAS System requirements, the development of optimal software architecture, and significant modifications to the usual CFD approaches used in fixed-wing aerodynamics. Phase I: Two principal results should be achieved during the Phase study. First, the governing equations and boundary conditions appropriate to a rotating blade should be derived, including the direct aeroelastic coupling between the flow field and the blade motion, and a satisfactory explanation of how the rotating-blade formulation will be implemented in the eventual numerical code must be given. Second, innovative methods of solving the combined set of equations should be developed and demonstrated for the relatively simple model problem of inviscid flow, with or without compressibility effects. This development should enable the CFD code to be substituted for the aerodynamic module in the 2GCHAS System. Preliminary validation of the numerical method by comparisons with experimental results would be desirable, but not required at this stage if satisfactory progress is documented. Phase II: Validation of the numerical method by comparisons with experimental results, for which the Aeroflightdynamics Directorate experimental data will be made available, must be undertaken early in Phase II. If appropriate, adjustments to the aerodynamics and structural dynamic models may be made at this stage.

NASA must utilize this facility because there is nothing comparable in the United States at the scale needed for helicopter noise research. Over the past several years, NASA Langley has developed a design for a complex aeroacoustic research facility that is primarily directed at model scale rotorcraft requirements. As the 'next' generation aeroacoustic wind tunnel, this facility promises to advance the knowledge of helicopter acoustic characteristics, however, such a facility will be very expensive, and construction analysis techniques may provide viable research opportunities in helicopter acoustics in existing NASA facilities. The goal of this SBIR is to demonstrate the potential of the beam-forming capabilities of a multi-element array in eliminating, or at least rendering negligible, both the background noise and hard surface reflected noise typically inherent in all wind tunnels not specifically designed for acoustic applications. By carefully designing and electronically steering the array, the acoustic signals that did not emanate from the source could be greatly attenuated. In evaluating array capabilities careful consideration should be given to the following interests: 1) Helicopter model frequency content 2) Helicopter model size 3) Array 'acceptance' beam size 4) The ability to measure directivity characteristics 5) The ability to 'point' the array to specifically examine localized sources on the helicopter model 6) In-flow/Out-of-flow measurement capability 7) Array physical size relative to wind-tunnel size 8) Maintaining a reasonable number of array elements Phase I: The expected results would be an evaluation of the feasibility and potential benefits of using array techniques in facilities like the Langley 14- by 22- Foot Subsonic Tunnel in the 'open throat' configuration.

Conventional pressure atomizers are unacceptable for advanced turboshaft engines. Likewise, state-of-the-art airblast atomizers appear to be reaching the limits of their capabilities in terms of turndown ratio and atomization quality at low power.

This knowledge of system error levied certain requirements on the accuracy of the DTD (Digital Terrain Data) supporting the missile’s terminal guidance. Assessing military units provides a larger challenge in that units are not as predicable as mechanical systems and performance characteristics are not well understood as are the laws of Physics.

Because all potential combat scenarios for a mission area cannot be included for training, methods for sampling combat conditions for training scenario design are required. The sampling methods must be Systematic and not rely solely on expert opinion. The fidelity of the combat training scenarios will depend largely on the adequacy of the sampling methods. In the past the major fidelity issue has been, ""How much fidelity is enough?"" That is, how much must the simulator physically and functionally resemble the weapon System? Current simulation trends (CTC, embedded training, appended devices) employ the weapon System in training; hence physical and functional fidelity issues assume less importance. As the questions about amount of fidelity diminish in importance, they are replaced by questions about kinds of fidelity; that is, ""What characteristics of combat environments must be simulated in order to ensure high probabilities of transfer to war- fighting?"" A type of fidelity that has not been given adequate attention may be broadly described as combat environment fidelity. Combat environment fidelity encompasses characteristics and behavior of the threat, behavior of other friendly forces, terrain and man-made cultural features, operator workload and information processing requirements, physical environment conditions (visibility, NBC, temperature) and support functions (logistics and maintenance), etc. The examination of combat environment fidelity for use in simulated combat scenarios is a relatively untouched area.

These sources will provide the information that must be sampled for inclusion in simulations.

While efforts are underway to reduce the workload imposed on the soldier through improved design of the soldier-System interface, other approaches must also be taken to adequately address workload issues. Even with an optimal soldier System interface, high workload will continue to threaten the attainment of required levels of performance, both because some soldiers are not able to effectively cope with imposed workload and because the operational environments impose a workload on the soldier over and above that imposed by the System. Phase I: Conduct a comprehensive review of previous work to identify: (a) categories of soldiers most likely to have low levels of workload tolerance; (b) families of functional relationships for predicting soldier performance from knowledge of the System-and environment-posed workload, and (c) intervention techniques which can be used to raise soldier performance capability in the face of high levels of imposed workload. Develop detailed plans and procedures for cost effective methods to implement, evaluate, and field the intervention techniques. Phase II: Execute the plans developed during Phase I. The long term goals are two-fold: (1) To develop and validate families of functional relationships for predicting the workload experienced by and the performance capabilities of identifiably different categories of soldiers. (2) To develop methods for enhancing soldier workload tolerance and performance using techniques such as special skill training for multiple task performance (that could, for example, emphasize methods to optimize task prioritization, task performance queuing, and task shedding).",267,1857,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65951/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65951/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:32:03,,,,,A91-209_65951,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C2_A91-209,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:44.31544+00

The expert System will derive rules regarding the most effective way to train neophyte Army aviators to hover and will implement those rules on an existing low cost visual flight simulator to provide effective hover training without the current requirement for a dedicated Instructor Pilot (IP).,"ARI has developed and evaluated a low cost helicopter simulator designated as the UH-l Training Research Simulator (UH-ITRS). The UH-ITRS has been evaluated in six research efforts to date and has been found to deliver positive Transfer of Training (TOT) to the UH1 helicopter. In addition, research has demonstrated that the UH-ITRS is capable of training neophyte flight students in basic hovering maneuvers. Hardware is currently installed to generate synthesized speech to provide feedback to trainees. There is a need to develop software to use the existing hardware (the UH-ITRS and the Texas Instruments voice generator) to provide improved hover training by verbally guiding the flight student in the learning of the hovering flight maneuvers. Phase I: Initial work will develop and evaluate expert System software to guide and enhance the automated training of basic hovering maneuvers. The goal is to become familiar with existing hardware and software that comprise the UH-ITRS and with research previously accomplished using the AHT. The contractor will develop an expert-System-based training program to both train neophyte Army flight students in the rudiments of hovering flight using computer generated voice feedback to guide their training and to evaluate their progress in training. The automated training System must support the current real- time simulation without slowing the aerodynamic calculations or the generation of images. Currently the nominal throughput delay is 84 ms and the image update rate is 30 Hz. The overall objective is to lower the cost of flight training by substituting low cost unmanned simulator training for helicopter training in the early portion of Primary Phase Initial Entry Rotary Wing (IERW) training. Phase II: Once the concept has been developed and proven for rudimentary hovering maneuvers, the next development phase will extend the concept of expert System based training in a low cost simulator to other Primary Phase IERW maneuvers.

TNAZ has energetic output comparable to HMX and impact sensitivity similar to Comp. B. The material has a melting point of 101 degrees Centigrade, and, hence, is steam-castable using existing technology. It is thermally stable and compatible with a wide variety of materials. Particle size is easily modified to provide small-size (e.g. 5 micron) material. TNAZ can be pressed to 98% theoretical maximum density without binder. TNAZ lends itself to both press-loaded and melt-cast high explosive (HE) formulations.

Phase I: Using the Blackhawk UH-60A as a design baseline, analyze several candidate main rotor blade de-ice systems which are potentially compatible with signature reduction features. RCS designs under consideration should provide a nominal 10 db broadband reduction from a metallized blade RCS level and should include magnetic radar absorbing material (RAM), lossy syntactic and Jaumann concepts. IR reduction designs should consider use of standard IR paints; the proposed de-ice systems should not increase the IR signature of the baseline blade under operational conditions encountered during cold icy weather. A tradeoff analysis of the candidates should be performed which considers: effect on RCS/IR during all modes of de-ice operation, compatibility with REC materials, de-ice system weight, power requirements, de-icing performance, system cost (manufacturing, maintenance).

Unfortunately, the cost of conducting full-scale flight tests has become so high, on the order of $100K per flight hour, that it can only be considered for the most important elements of research and development where any other method of test is wholly inadequate, and considerable work is now underway to replace or supplement flight testing with simulation and analysis to the maximum extent possible. The free flight testing effort will encompass a suite of widely varying rotorcraft configurations (plants). One goal of the project is to study the effects of varying the parameters which characterize the plant. A traditional approach to developing this control system would require modeling every perturbation of the plant and developing a new control system for the altered plant prior to flight. The manual effort involved in this modeling and redesign must be minimized or performed automatically by the control system maximize the utility of the free flight testing system. This controls problem is difficult and well suited to exploit recent advances in intelligent control theory. The goal of this SBIR is to develop a highly capable, modular, and yet compact flight control system for the FFRRV.

(2) Modular hardware and software elements to allow rapid system alteration, maintenance and repair. (3) Dedicated sensor suite for the control system independent of the research data system. (4) Possible flight scenario's will dictate the trade off in implementing the stability and control augmentation between the airborne and ground based computer system.

The FFRRV program is developing the technology to perform dynamic agility, stability, control, and acoustic research using instrumented, free flight, reduced-scale powered rotorcraft models having Mach-scaled wind-tunnel model rotor systems. The free-flight rotorcraft program is in part an outgrowth of the fixed-wing drop model program which has become an essential part of the development of all high-performance military aircraft; the significant difference between the rotary-wing and fixed-wing programs is that the helicopter models must be powered and are therefore subject to all of the dynamic handling quality issues of full-scale helicopters, but amplified by the smaller scale of the research vehicle. Development of a telepresence capability can provide the model helicopter research pilot with considerably enhanced sensory environment, necessary for nap of the earth flight and when coupled with a computerized control system which can emulate full-scale aircraft control laws and handling qualities at model scale. Although the telepresence research is to be conducted on helicopter models, the technology is wholly transferrable to the fixed-wing activities at Plum Tree, and to the unmanned air vehicle, flight test, and robotics communities at large. Although there have been a number of studies aimed at providing remotely controlled systems some measure of telepresence capability the technology is immature and there are few precedents on which to rely for guidance. Moreover, the technique has never before been attempted at this scale for research flight vehicles having the level of performance expected from the FFRRV, and there are several unknowns in solving the telepresence problem. For example, the required tracking rates and damping characteristics for vision systems needed for flight operations are not well defined, nor has the significance of inertial and aural piloting cues been examined. Several novel means of providing simulated vibration and g-force cues are also being formulated for integration with the aircraft sensor suite to provide aircraft state information to the pilot through the cockpit environment. This technology offers not only enhanced research capabilities for model flight research conducted at Langley, but also has exciting implications for full scale flight testing, hazardous environment operations for all forms of automotive vehicles, combat, reconnaissance and surveillance activities, and robotic applications.

The emphasis of this program is to develop an inlet protection system with the highest efficiency for the lowest cost and size.,"The small gas turbine engines (under 3 lbs/sec flow class) currently used as helicopter APUs/SPUs are extremely susceptible to performance degradation due to sand ingestion. Currently, only vortex tube type inlet particle separators have been used to protect production APUs. Vortex tube type separators are very efficient at removing sand but the size and cost of this type of separator can make them difficult and expensive to retrofit existing APUs. New concepts for high efficiency inlet protection systems need to be developed for current and future APUs/SPUs. The desired levels of sand removal efficiency for C-Spec (200 micron median particle size), AC-Coarse (30 micron), and AC Fine (8 micron) test sands are 99%, 95%, and 89% with a pressure drop less than 3%. It is preferable that the new concepts be completely self cleaning although barrier filters (and other concepts that could require frequent maintenance) could also be considered as part of a desert kit to enhance the inlet protection system performance in severe sand environment.

All current helicopters have n/rev and 1/rev vibration levels that detract from mission performance somewhere in the aircraft envelope and these vibrations are a major source of damage to aircraft mission equipment as well. The current state-of-the-art analyses capability is inadequate to design helicopters for low vibration so it is necessary to design vibration suppression devices after the aircraft's first flight. The problem of rotor loads and vibration prediction is extremely difficult and involves detailed calculation of the aerodynamic loading on the blade, the rotor structural response, and the helicopter fuselage response. Because of the complexity of the loading and response, it is impossible to take a final quantitative measurement, such as the n/rev vibration at the pilot's seat, and work back to a single cause for this vibration. To solve this problem it is necessary to make many measurements at many locations and in this way isolate the inadequate portions of our design analyses. One of the intermediate measurements that is essential to improvement of analyses is an exact knowledge of the blade motion. Presently, these motions are inferred by structural loads measurements, but the accuracy of these estimated has never been determined. It may be possible now, with new optical/video systems and sophisticated target tracking algorithms to make these determinations. Phase I: An optical/video system with an appropriate tracking algorithm will be used to examine rotor blade motion in hover. The primary objective will be the accurate tracking of rigid blade motions, that is, blade flapping and feathering.

An actuator of this type could produce a 15 Db reduction in gearbox noise. In order to be weight competitive with currently used acoustical enclosures, the actuators should weigh less than 10 pounds. Advanced piezoelectric materials such as ceramics, polymers, or composites of the two are candidates for such a device. The proper combination or configuration of these materials could allow a lightweight, high force, high frequency actuator to be developed. In addition, electroreological and magnetostrictive technology could also be applicable to such a device. Phase I: Develop a single axis high power density actuator for active noise cancellation of helicopter main rotor transmission vibrations. The configuration of the actuator should provide minimum weight and volume and be highly durable in the helicopter environment. The actuator should produce canceling forces in a single axis. Unique or enabling technological aspects of the device shall be demonstrated by bench testing. The results of this bench testing shall be used to evaluate the concept's potential for successful development. Phase II: The configuration demonstrated in the Phase I effort shall be further optimized and retested. A detailed design of a multi-axis flightworthy device shall be conducted. Several devices shall be fabricated. The contractor shall coordinate this effort and the potential of testing the device on an aircraft or suitable rig with a helicopter airframe manufacturer.",301,1963,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57160/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57160/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:32:28,,,,,A92-023_57160,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C2_A92-023,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:44.31544+00

This would indicate user control over the fault detection and recovery strategies and Ada runtime services that insure a predictable state when failures occur.,"Since Ada is the DoD mandated language, it must be able to be used effectively for Army distributed fault tolerant systems. By having an effective failure semantics model, the effect of various system faults on a program executing across a distributed system can be determined. It can also dictate the kind of functionality required from an Ada runtime environment during fault conditions. Enhancing and tailoring support for fault tolerant Ada software based on a failure semantics model is the basis of this project. Issues to be addressed include: fault detection, containment, and recovery; use of exception handling; and reconfiguration strategies. Examples of faults are failures in memory, communication subsystems, and permanent or intermittent failure of processors. Runtime services needed to support fault tolerant operation need to be addressed. Special attention must be paid to the runtime maintaining a consistent view if a rendezvous across a network is occurring when a fault occurs. Ways to reconfigure and to allow continued operation need to be addressed. The features of Ada 9X that could support fault tolerance need to be assessed and incorporated as appropriate. Phase I: Capitalize and assess existing approaches to a fault model for effectively using Ada in real-time distributed systems that have a need for continued operation in the presence of faults. Formulate a strategy to tailor an Ada runtime environment that could provide the needed support and propose a solution that will answer as a minimum the issues described in this solicitation.

This effort addresses basic IEW system security accreditation issues and answers.,"Future IEW systems are being targeted to be hosted upon Unix based platforms. These systems must meet Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) system security accreditation criteria. Part of IEW application development efforts is to properly isolate from accessing Unix (intentionally or unintentionally). What is needed is an innovative approach to an IEW application toolkit that aids the system developer in solving this problem when the version of Unix is not considered secure and assist when it is. This toolbox would provide software engineering approaches and solutions to the common accreditation problems encountered in building an IEW application. This effort involves identification of key IEW system accreditation issues, tools for overcoming weaknesses, and implementation guidelines for specific functions in accomplishing system security accreditation objectives. IEW systems have normally been operated at ""system High"" and concerned only with a collateral release function and not multi-level security. This effort will focus upon making security accreditation a part of overall IEW design rather than an afterthought. One result will be a ""how to manual"" for IEW system managers to guide them in IEW system building.

However, one of the major drawbacks is the issue of affordability as these MMW systems have proven to be both complex and expensive once they reach a prototype package configuration. This is particularly true of dual polarized monopulse antenna and transceiver subsystems which end up having insufficient polarization isolation, limited signal to receiver noise ratio at the desired target acquisition ranges, and systems that are difficult and costly to package in a small diameter munition. Present day antenna and transceiver components must still be hand built and ""hand tweaked"" to achieve acceptable performance. For production, this translates to expensive manufacturing procedures, tooling and testing which results in high DTUPC costs. This severely limits the transition of MMW systems to the production of smart weapon systems. The U.S. Army is interested in developing a new unique technology for integrating a W-Band antenna and transceiver into a high performance, highly producibility assembly. It is desired that this integrated assembly operate over the complete waveguide band from 75 to 110 GHz and provide a SSB noise figure of 3 to 4 dB in each receiver channel. This assembly is required to provide dual plane, dual polarized receiver operation for coherent target acquisition and monopulse tracking with existing signal processing applications. The integrated assembly must be amenable to both pulse and FMCW waveforms. Interface of the assembly with typical transmitter configurations must be addressed and consideration of the integration of transmitters into the complete assemble is desired. The antenna for the integrated assembly may be a fixed real antenna capable of both strapdown and gimbaled installation. Alternately, the antenna may be electronically scanned and capable of both strapdown and gimballed installation. For either case, a description of the antenna characteristics must be detailed and the plans to achieve the polarization isolation of 40 to 50 dB must be presented. Packaging studies of the selected integrated antenna/transceiver must be described to show how it can be packaged into an airframe diameter of 150mm or less.

It combines the best attributes of both methods in that it has the capability to grow ultra-thin layers as with the OMVPE technique, and requires significantly less arsine or phosphine and has an increased ability for selective area growth as with the hydride method. As an example, GaAs can be grown in a hot wall reactor by paralyzing diethylgallium chloride (DEGaC1) or reacting trimethylgallium (TMGa) with HC1 to form GaC1 in the reaction zone and then flowing it downstream to react with arsine. Thin layers of GaAs can now be grown by switching the TMGa or DEGaC1 flow on and off, and much less arsine will be required because it reacts much more readily with GaC1 than with TMGa. Phase I: Phase I should result in a design and analysis of a growth system. Topics to be included concerning the design of the system are the flow systems, gas mixing chamber, hot wall reactor, and pumps for low pressure growth. An analysis of the different chemical reactions and the potential for carbon contamination should also be included. Phase II: The primary goal of Phase II is to build and test the growth system. Because the system can contain toxic gases, it will have to be leak tight and contain the necessary safety equipment. Epitaxial films will be grown and electrically, optically, and chemically characterized, and optimum growth conditions will be determined using this data. Device structures will then be grown, and devices will be fabricated from them and tested. Potential Commercial Market: The ability to grow thin layers of GaAs and InP based compounds with better selectivity and with reduced amounts of arsine and phosphine would have a tremendous impact on the electronics and opto-electronics industry.

Extended Abstracts of the Fall 1991 Electrochemical Society Meeting, Phoenix, AZ, Oct 13-18, 1991; c.) J. Applied Polymer Science Vol. 43(9), p. 1589, 1991; d.) IEEE Transactions Insulation and Resistance, Dec. 1991, e.) Polymers for Advanced Technologies Vol. 2, Dec 1991. In addition, initial evaluations on prototype, spirally wound polymer capacitors (where the full capacitor had been briefly exposed to a 96% CF4/ 4% 02 gas plasma) have shown that at least a doubling (and in some instances, a fourfold increase) of breakdown voltage can be achieved. It is important to better understand the reasons for this rapid and inexpensive improvement and to select the type of gas plasma, exposure time and applied plasma power levels in order to optimize the breakdown voltage without causing any undesirable effects on other bulk properties of the polymers or capacitors.

We have found that one such technique has been very effective in its ability to classify certain types of targets. The technique is human operator's interpretation of the radar baseband audio doppler return from the particular target classes. The baseband doppler frequencies generated by a target give rise to a characteristically unique sound pattern based on the radial motion of the particular target over time. In many cases, a target can be type classified, and in some cases identified, by an operator listening to this audio signal over a relatively short period of time. This type of classification differs from what is normally called doppler, or spectral, classification in that the spectral classification is performed over a very short interval of time, usually called a ""coherent processing interval"" (CPI). The data gathered in one CPI is sufficient for ""Spectral Analysis"" techniques for target classification, but is too small a sample for audio ""Feature Extraction"" pattern matching. Such a machine analysis would require a prior knowledge concerning the audio pattern, over time, generated by each target class for a particular range of baseband doppler frequencies which vary for changing radar-to-target aspect angles. This proposed technique is not unlike ""Voice Template/Pattern Matching"" used in some automated entry security systems, and also used in Speech Recognition. Currently, radar operators are trained in this ""Pattern Matching"" technique by listening to recorded Doppler signals from various targets under different conditions. In order to achieve the automation desired, these audio features, in the form of overlay templates or patterns, must be stored in the system so as to allow rapid search, analysis, and reporting. Initial work on this subject would define the methods and concepts for implementation of a limited audio pattern knowledge base which would support knowledge based processing, Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks or Artificial Neural Systems (ANS). Using these techniques and concepts, the data would then be autonomously utilized by the system to produce valid conclusions relative to the classification of particular targets detected by the radar sensor system. Phase I: In addition to the basic question of over all feasibility of such an automated ""Expert"" and/or ""Neural"" system, there are at least three fundamental questions to be answered in the initial phase of the project: (1) What is the minimum sample time interval required to produce a valid feature pattern for knowledge base comparison? (2) Can such an interval be constructed using the combined data extracted from periodic hits on a tracked target from a scanning radar, or, must the radar dwell on the target over the required interval in order to obtain the appropriate pattern? (3) Keeping in mind that the objective is only to identify, not understand, how may the methods and techniques of Speech Recognition technology coupled with Artificial Intelligence and Neural Network concepts, simplify and enhance our ability to autonomously classify radar targets using the baseband audio Doppler? Phase II: Following the initial phase of the effort, during which the methods and techniques are firmly established, actual implementation of a knowledge base system test bed can be accomplished during a second phase using suitable recorded, as well as real time, Doppler audio data and appropriate processing equipment.",565,3717,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57249/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57249/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:05,,,,,A92-121_57249,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C2_A92-121,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:44.834043+00

Since the component (or die) is only part of an assembly (refer to Fig. 1) any rotational movement of the table will throw the component off center. To accommodate this deficiency, a refocusing and/or realignment operation is required before a new side of component can be inspected. Tough technically feasible, this technique is time consuming and unreliable.","Due to the limitation of traditional 2D sensor array technologies such as machine vision, laser dimensional measurement equipment etc., multiple view of the cylindrical surface must be taken for flaw detection and analysis. In frequent situations, manual inspections were employed to detect and interpret these flaws. This is time consuming, labor intensive, and subject to human error. With the advancements of computer technologies, today's image processing techniques should be able to stop beyond a human's stereo image analysis barrier. Technologies for capturing and analyzing a panoramic view of an object with a single snap short or machine cycle time must be explored. Innovative ideas are sought using a combination of these technologies to substitute a human's image acquisition and decision making process. Phase I: Develop a novel approach to acquire the panoramic image of an object, then develop an image analysis process to interpret the image and isolate predetermined flaws. Detection and identification of adhesive flaws around a microelectronic component such as a die, is good test for the concept. This concept must address the illumination technique, image acquisition technique, and flaw identification scheme. A feasibility of the technologies proposed in this application in terms of speed, precision, a resolution and reliability should also be addressed. Phase II: Finalize the design and build a prototype system. Integrate the system into a manufacturing environment for the real-rime inspection of flaws. Document the performance of the inspection including the accuracy, speed, cost of operation, and the savings achieved.",246,1654,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57120/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57120/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:06,,,,,A92-123_57120,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C2_A92-123,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:44.834043+00

Unfortunately the fact that they are point sources limits the fidelity of the EM Environments, particularly in the case of the vertical electric fields.

Alternatively, develop the technology required to directionally solidify tungsten heavy alloys that results in crystallographically oriented tungsten grains in the heavy alloy.","It has been reported in the open literature that single crystals of pure tungsten in the orientation (with respect to the axis) perform as well as depleted uranium in laboratory scale ballistic experiments. Consequently, there is a strong desire to scale-up the size of the oriented tungsten material for full-scale ballistic tests. Two alternative approaches are immediately apparent. The first is to develop the technology to grow large single crystals of pure tungsten. The state-of-the-art limits these crystals to less than 10mm in diameter. A second route to a solution may be through the heavy alloy system: tungsten-nickel-iron. These alloys are produced by liquid phase sintering during which a mechanism known as solution-reprecipitation causes significant growth of the tungsten grains. The tungsten grains in a heavy alloy are typically non-oriented single crystals, but the use of controlled processing may allow the orientation of these grains. The obvious advantages of the second approach are lower processing temperatures and the in situ formation of the single crystals. Phase I: Demonstrate the processing technique proposed and deliver samples of the oriented material. Ideally, Phase I will be able to demonstrate the production of samples sufficient to perform quarter-scale ballistic tests. This requires a diameter of at least 10mm and a length of ten times the diameter. All work must be supported by x-ray diffraction and mechanical property testing. Phase II: Exploit the knowledge gained in Phase I and scale-up the process to produce material that can be used in full-scale ballistic tests.

Work in this area can be categorized into several areas: interactive design, novel sensors, intelligent controls, and expert systems software. Interactive design includes unique ideas and concepts which facilitate the planned application of NDE methods and sensors to the inspectibility, production monitoring, and life cycle monitoring of components and assemblies during the design process. The design tools will be computer based knowledge tools which will augment and compliment one or more computer aided design (CAD) packages commonly used by designers. For example, an expert system may provide the designer with advice on sensor selection, parameters, and placement to ensure condition monitoring during manufacturing and field use. The design tools should also be capable of recommending design changes to improve manufacturability. Novel sensors include those used during the manufacturing process to monitor the condition of the part during fabrication, thereby facilitating process control and, ideally, the use of embedded sensors for continuous monitoring of part condition following manufacture. Intelligent adaptive controls includes those capable of collecting data from various sensory inputs and using neural net logic to monitor/assess part condition either during processing or use. Then, based on the condition of the part, adjusting process parameters to compensate for changing conditions. Expert systems software is an integral component of intelligent sensors and controls. Innovations in this technology are of interest for manufacturing and life cycle monitoring based on sensor data describing material condition/parameters.

Existing methods of making whiskers or fibers with suitable properties are expensive, and whisker handling is heavily regulated and can be hazardous. Biomimetic processes proceed under ambient conditions and in the absence of most hazardous materials. In addition, with a fully controllable process it may be possible to grow whiskers in situ for later infiltration by matrix materials, thus eliminating handling problems. Biomimetic processing methods mimic the physico-chemical pathways by which organisms conduct synthesis reactions. To understand these pathways, biological analogues must be investigated and the controlling factors of the synthesis reactions determined and duplicated. The goal of this work is not to make microorganisms do the actual synthesis, but to elucidate and mimic the manner in which they do so, so that the process can be detached from the organism and applied to materials synthesis technology. Although biomimetic production of magnetite and other ceramic materials has recently sparked great interest in the biotechnology field, it has not yet been demonstrated how the process can be separated from the organism or its parts.

Nanocrystalline materials have crystal sizes that are on the order of a few nanometers in at least one direction and represent a reduction of scale of several orders of magnitude. The nanocrystal grains are separated by boundary core regions (grain boundaries) that are lower in density and higher in energy than the bulk grain. The density decrease is due to the poor crystallograph match across the boundary. In nanocrystalline materials the boundaries can occupy up to 50 volume percent of the structure and as a result can control the properties and the atomic structure of the overall solid. It is thus these boundaries that represent the essential structural component in nanocrystalline materials. Equiaxed nanocrystals are characterized by: (1) higher diffusivity and reactivity, (2) alloying of typically insoluble elements due to the open boundary structure, (3) ductile behavior of small grained materials, and (4) reduced Young's modules compared to the bulk as a result of increased interatomic distances. The group VIB elements (Cr, Mo, and W) show a lack of tolerance, (a low solubility), for excess impurities, which then are rejected to the grain boundaries. This segregation leads to a loss of cohesion between the grains and is manifested as brittle failure when stressed. For tungsten, the ability to tolerate typically insoluble impurities (oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc.) at the grain boundaries along with the reduced grain size may result in ductile pure tungsten. Military applications may include kinetic energy penetrators, shaped charge liners and explosively formed projectiles.

The robotic inspection system will be capable of inspecting the interior surface of the tank without defueling or removing the contents of the tank.,"The Army currently operates and maintains over 20,000 underground storage tanks (USTs) many of which are untested. In addition to federal requirements stated in 40 CFR part 280, Army Regulation 200-1 requires all USTs to be in compliance with the most stringent federal, state, local or Army policy including leak detection corrosion protection and spill/overflow prevention. One problem facing any owner of an existing UST is tank assessment, which is critical to the decision making process for tank management. The ""Automated In Situ Tank Inspection System"" would utilize robotic technology to inspect the interior surface of a tank using an ultrasonic sensor to develop a wall thickness profile. These data can then be used to develop a current condition index. The system would consist of: 1) Manipulator (6 DOF), 2) Sensor for collision avoidance, 3) Ultrasonic sensor, 4) Force sensor for sensor application, 5) PC based computing environment, and 6) Custom software for testing procedures. Phase I: Design Robotic In Situ Inspection System. Phase II: Integrate system in order to provide a detailed tank wall profile which can be used to develop a current tank condition index.

Frequent measurements of these parameters during a storm would contribute to our understanding of the small-scale structure and time-dependent nature of icing events.,"The rotating multicylinder has been used to determine the liquid water content (LWC) and median volume droplet diameter (MVD) in fogs at subfreezing temperatures. A description of the instrument design, deployment, and analysis of the measurements is contained in Howe (CRREL Report 91-2, 1991). Briefly, the mass of ice accreted in a known time period on six cylinders of different diameters is measured, along with the wind speed, air temperature and atmospheric pressure. With these data and curves relating the collection efficiency to Reynolds number and inertia parameter (e.g., Finstad et al., A Computational Investigation of Water Droplet Trajectories, J. Atmos. Ocean. Tech., 5, 1988) the cloud LWC and MVD are determined and a rough idea of the droplet size distribution is obtained. The method is labor intensive and time consuming, precluding frequent measurements during an icing storm. We would like an automatic system, exploiting, like the multicylinder, the variation in droplet collection efficiency of different size cylinders (or other shapes). Because only two parameters, LWC and a typical droplet size, are to be determined, the accreted ice mass need be measured on only two cylinders. The masses must be measured precisely (to at least 0.5%) under potentially windy (up to 40 m/s) and cold (down to -10 C) conditions. The device must also survive, but not necessarily operate in, windier and colder weather. The measurement frequency should be at least once per hour with minimal labor required by the site personnel. Phase I: Determine feasibility for construction of such an instrument. Develop a working ""breadboard model"" which will meet above requirements. Conduct laboratory tests to verify proper performance of the ""breadboard model."" Assume that temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind speed measurements are made independently and are available as frequently as needed by the automatic multicylinder. It can also be assumed that the instrument will be used at a manned site with electrical power available. Phase II: Design and build a prototype instrument meeting the above requirements. Modify the instrument based on the Phase I tests. Deploy the instrument in the field under icing conditions. Deploy the instrument in the field under icing conditions. Potential Commercial Market: This device would be useful in any ground based investigation to determine the icing susceptibility of potential sites for power lines, transmission towers, radar installations or wind farms.

Areas of particular interest include assessing the impact of shortwave radiation on biological activity in and under the ice and investigating through-ice communication capabilities. Existing submersible spectroradiometers are designed to be used in open water and consequently are not sensitive enough for the low light levels found under snow covered thick ice and are too bulky for easy under-ice use. The instrument must be sensitive enough for measurements under snow covered ice, where light levels are typically less than 1% of incident values. The transmitted light field exhibits a strong spectral dependence (more blue light, less red) making spectral light leakage a significant concern. A cosine-corrected irradiance collector is a critical component of the instrument. This is a field instrument so it must function at cold temperatures (-20 to 0 C) and be lightweight for portability. Since drilling large holes through ice several meters thick is difficult, the submersible portion of the instrument should fit down a small hole (ideally with diameter less than 9 inches). On board data storage would be a useful feature. Phase I: Design and develop a breadboard spectroradiometer for use under floating ice covers.

The release actuator should have a minimum of moving parts and be designed to cut 30- to 60- lb test monofilament line. High-frequency acoustic signals should be used such that the shipboard unit can trigger the release from a distance of at least 20 meters but not more than 30 meters. The seafloor unit should have a depth capability of 5 to 25 meters and be housed in a non-metallic cylinder which is less that 46 cm long and 10 cm in diameter; in use the long axis will be horizontal. The deck unit should be waterproof and rugged, use modular components, support the use of at least 1,024 separate release codes, and signal the operator when release occurs. Phase II: Develop production techniques and specifications which can be used to produce either non-redundant or double-redundant acoustic release systems meeting the target costs and delivery times below. Produce and deliver three units of the selected type for testing by the Army sponsor.

For example, conceptual (integrative) skills are quite important in the performance of senior executives, and their selection for advancement. In addition, recent findings that the same or similar conceptual skills may be required for full adult maturity (necessary for objectivity in executive decision-making) as defined by Kegan. However, relatively little is known about how these skills develop in adulthood, methods for accelerating their growth, and the role, if any, of so-called ""metacognitive"" skills. Several taxonomies of cognitive skills already exist. However, not a great deal is known about metacognition--or metacognitive skills--and the processes by which cognitive skills develop in adulthood. Further, little is known about individual differences in adult development, though lay experience suggests that substantial individual differences exist. (By inference, cognitive skill self-awareness--metacognition--ought to be important, in that it could be argued that self-generated feedback loops are necessary for development.) Finally, when progressive development does occur, the relative contributions of potential and experience are unclear. The requested research would develop low cost automated technologies for assessing these skills, investigate skill development profiles (i.e., essentially norm the technologies for the key transition points in an officer's development, notionally at the points in time when sent to schools), confirm their importance in executive performance, and produce technologies (preferably automated) to accelerate their development at the various points at which they can be assessed. Phase I: Phase I will require the development of a theoretical model which links cognitive and metacognitive skill development, and will identify low cost techniques for measuring these skills. Phase II: Phase II will require the development of measurement techniques, norming them, and producing technologies which can be used to accelerate their acquisition. The Phase II development will also require experimental demonstration of the effectiveness of these technologies, and a further demonstration that growth in these skills enhances performance in executive decision-making tasks.",328,2394,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/54049/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/54049/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:18,,,,,A92-154_54049,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C2_A92-154,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.307477+00

Advanced flight control synthesis techniques are being coupled with increasingly sophisticated comprehensive analytical models of helicopter structural dynamics and fluid mechanics in order to design more effective flight control systems. The Army is currently developing a Second Generation Comprehensive Helicopter Analysis System (2GCHAS) to provide significant improvements in helicopter analysis capability but it is currently restricted to simplified flight control system models.

The newest of these approaches, AM1, is finding wide-spread acceptance among many researchers from academia, industry and government. AM1 has been used very successfully to investigate properties of a large number of molecules. These results have proven valuable in predicting physical, chemical, and biological properties, and in understanding the behavior of chemical compounds. However, because this approach does rely on empirically derived parameters, many molecules containing unparameterized atoms cannot be investigated. Phase I: Phase I of this research will begin with the retrieval of appropriate experimental data from the literature. The elements will be ordered in terms of priority. The highest priority elements for which sufficient experimental data exist will be parameterized during this phase. Phase II: Phase II will continue the parameterization of the main group elements. The results for molecules containing elements parameterized during Phase I will be completely verified, and parameters will be developed for the remaining elements, in descending order of priority. All parameters will be included into the most recent versions of AMPAC and MOPAC, and released to the public domain via appropriate mechanisms. In this way, this research will benefit not only government researchers, but those in academia and the private sector as well.

These systems take the form of both stand - alone and embedded trainers which almost always use simulation to achieve the training objectives. Training devices and simulators have proven to be an effective tool in transferring information over a broad range of applications. ITSs are an emerging technology field that is gaining visibility within the Army as evidenced by its recognition as the artificial intelligence (AI) subtechnologies broken out for emphasis in the U.S. Army Materiel Command's AI Technology Master Plan(AIMP). Whereas the AIMP promotes a broad based research vision for ITS technology, PM TRADE chooses to focus ITS research efforts in two(2) principle areas that more closely support its mission: ITSs that incorporate existing simulations into the ITS architecture; and ITSs that are constrained to include simulators/simulations as a component of the ITS design. The distinction between the two areas is subtle but crucial, i.e., in the former case the ITS design must adapt to incorporate a ""fixed"" simulator/simulation into the architecture and in the latter case a simulator/simulation is an a prior ""free"" design element under the ITS designer's control. An effective ITS development strategy addresses the ITS architectural and functional component design issues for the two (2) areas first in the context of individual training and then extending those results to the crew/team/combined arms training situations. A ITS testbed would be a key element of any ITS development strategy on which to verify and validate ITS architectures and functional component models. A potentially robust and effective functional ITS architecture has been developed by the RD&E Center of U.S. Army Missile Command in Huntsville, Alabama in support of the Intelligent Embedded Operator Assistant (IEOA) project.

The potential raw material volume can support many other uses of these recycled waste materials.Innovative construction material systems are needed that make optimum use of these waste materials yet produce equal or superior materials for the construction and/or rehab of facilities. Fiber reinforced composites made from recycled plastics or lightweight construction blocks/bricks made from fly ash are possible examples. Phase I: Analyze and assess the opportunities for the development of various construction materials made from recycled waste products. Phase II: Manufacture selected materials that show the most promise and demonstrate their performance in a constructed facility.

Future LADAR systems can be readaptable and retrainable to spontaneous combat, target, countermeasure and clutter conditions with extremely short notice. This meets the emerging requirements of the Army that future systems shall be field adaptable to new conditions, especially countermeasure surprise.

Usually, this is accomplished with the use of mechanical gimbal contrivances. The ability to ultimately achieve strap-down seekers with no macro-size moving parts would be of considerable interest. Solid state or micro-device optical concepts which can provide dynamic and agile control over the instantaneous line of sight of a seeker with no macro-size moving parts are of interest in order to solve this problem. The concept must lend itself to lightweight, rugged, mass producible, and low cost objectives. The detector being scanned can range from a single detector, small linear array, or a full 2D imaging focal plane array. Examples of methods which can combine micro-device, principles with optical scanning are: mosaic reflecting or refracting optics with individually controllable optical properties, geometry, focal length, index of refractions, aperture, aspheric shape, etc. Micro Fresnel lenses, mirrors, gratings, holograms, binary optics, deformable devices etc., are further examples provided that they can be micro-controlled based on microdevice principles.

Current techniques for these types of indirect fire weapon systems require the establishment of an azimuth orientation line by survey techniques employed by a survey party. It is desired that towed artillery weapons, self-propelled mortars and ground mortars be equipped with an autonomous capability to establish laying azimuth referenced to grid north. Available orienting systems which are used on some self-propelled artillery weapons are based on internal navigation system technology and are too large and heavy, too costly, and impose an unacceptable power requirement for use on the weapon systems envisioned. The characteristics required of the device are: accuracy of azimuth determination +/- 1 artillery mil RMS; time to determine azimuth no greater than 2 min with options for less time with reduced accuracy at operator selection; output either in true or grid azimuth; power requirements minimized with provision for integral battery and 24 v military vehicle power input; sufficiently rugged to withstand the maximum firing shock on a 155mm towed howitzer (can be in a standby or off mode during firing); provision for verification of boresight, i.e., alignment with the center line of the weapon bore when mounted on the weapon; output available for visual reading by the operator and as a digital signal for input into a fire control computer. The device should minimize, in so far as possible, size and weight so as to allow portability for light weapon systems. Production cost is also a design consideration so that the device can be afforded in sufficient quantity to equip each towed howitzer and heavy and medium mortar with the device. Phase I: Develop the design concept of the azimuth orienting device. Produce two broad board type proof of concept units, one to be applied to towed howitzers and one for mortar systems. Develop preliminary functional specifications based on results of laboratory and field testing of the units. Phase II: Produce sufficient follow-on units based on the preliminary functional specifications from Phase I to fully evaluate the technical and functional characteristics of the concept in an operational environment. Support both technical and user testing of the units. Develop finalized functional specifications. Potential Commercial Market: This system would have direct application in the engineering survey and mapping technology areas. It would apply to a number of similar commercial applications where an accurate directional reference with respect to north is required. OSCR: The operational concepts of indirect fire control that would be permitted with fire control systems based on this subsystem would allow the reduction of the reliance on survey capability to orient artillery and mortar weapons in the field.

The portable Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, envisioned as the primary position and navigation device for military vehicles, will use a small alpha numeric operator interface. Position coordinates are read on a display and the grid coordinates of waypoints, etc., are entered via a keypad. The operator must manually make the association with his military map to locate his position or determine the grid coordinates of targets or waypoints. Each of these operations requires additional steps which are potential sources of operator error. Due to the importance of timely and accurate navigation for the successful conduct of highly mobile military operations and for the prevention of fratricide, a method is required whereby the POS/NAV system operator on a military ground vehicle can interface with the navigation system, principally the GPS receiver, using his most familiar and readily available navigation device, the military map. A unit is desired which would be a component of the ground vehicle POS/NAV system, uses the current military map as its basis and allows the operator to locate his position, locate other positions, and perform other IO tasks directly from the map. Examples of functions to be performed are: locate present coordinates of any position indicated on the map, enter grid coordinates of a waypoint indicated on the map into the POS/NAV system; enter a series of waypoints defining an intended route of travel; recall a waypoint and indicate its location on the map for verification; indicate the range and azimuth to a designated location on the map from the vehicle's present position. The unit should accommodate military maps of various scales and be easily oriented. The size of the unit should allow convenient use inside a M1A1 tank or a Bradley Fighting Vehicle.

The use of such a map interface unit with a GPS position location system can be applied to a number of vehicle navigation situations. GPS navigation is being proposed for urban and inter-urban transportation vehicles, emergency vehicles, law enforcement vehicles, environmental management vehicles and even private use vehicles. It would have future use in survey and engineering applications for field data gathering and analysis. OSCR: Unit has great OSCR potential.

The methodology and design environment developed in this SBIR can be used by many industries such as hydraulic and electric motor manufacturers, machine tool manufactures, process control companies, automobile and aircraft companies, robotic applications, stabilized optical sight systems, etc. Anyone who designs control systems must confront nonlinearities, parameter variations, backlash, friction and resonant modes. OSCR: Microprocessor-based control is a low-cost platform independent way to implement advanced control algorithms. One of it's biggest benefits is the ability to rapidly modify the control algorithms, making it very cost effective when upgrading a weapon platform or even moving the entire system to a new application. Nearly all of the current controllers in the Army are analog based; i.e. capacitors, op amps and resistors fixed to a circuit card. Changes are very hard to make and portability between weapon platforms is impossible. If one microprocessor could be used for each servo control application in the Army with only the code being modified, the cost savings could be large. Another cost saving aspect of this work is the ability to get very high performance out of systems with backlash, friction, resonant modes, etc. What this means is that the Army can use a low-cost microprocessor-based Adaptive-Nonlinear Controller rather than buying new, very precise (and expensive) mechanical hardware or retrofitting existing systems to eliminate the nonlinearities, i.e. improve the performance with better algorithms and software rather than hardware.",476,3427,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63389/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63389/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:43,,,,,A93-043_63389,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-043,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.307477+00

ANC (Automatic Noise Cancellation) techniques such as the classic Widrow algorithm, have been considered for cancellation of such interference, but these techniques in elementary form have not offered the degree of cancellation needed when the weapon platform or own-vehicle is ""stationary/operating""; the problem becomes much more difficult when the acoustic sensor system must detect and locate distant threat ground combat vehicle and helicopter targets while operating on a moving ground vehicle (""sense on-the-move""). Innovative practical and effective acoustic noise cancellation/ reduction techniques will be developed. Research should address both stationary/operating and ""sense on-the-move"" cases. Initially, work should address the simpler case where the acoustic sensor system is mounted on a stationary ground vehicle with engine on, and the weapon platform fire control systems are operating. Examples of approaches to the problem might include (1) ANC with multiple reference sensors and innovative signal processing algorithms, (2) enhance the correlation between interference sources at the signal and reference sensors (model the interference transfer function), and (3) adaptive spatial beamforming and null-steering in the direction of the interfering sources. Also of interest are development of more robust acoustic sensor signal processing and algorithmic techniques which enhance the ability of the sensor itself (exclusive of any external reference sensors, ANC processing, etc.) to resist performance degradation in noisy environments. This research directly supports Army mission areas: Air-Defense, EMW (such as smart-mines); Close-Combat (Armor self defense, etc.); Fire Support (inc. AFAS, FARV, Fire Support Modernization Plan, Artillery location/counterbattery); IEW. Phase I: Assess the amount of noise cancellation required for typical weapon platforms to achieve the required acoustic sensor system performance (e.g. target detection, classification, etc.). Define and develop an effective, robust, and practical baseline system for acoustic noise/interference reduction/cancellation for the ""stationary/operating"" case. Use existing recorded data, and/or conduct measurements of noise field of one or more candidate Army vehicle/weapons platforms. Conduct a computer simulation and/or a laboratory/field test to assess potential performance and technical feasibility of this baseline design concept. Develop system design for canceling/reducing ""on-the-move"" vehicle noise. Phase II: Construct experimental noise cancellation/reduction system hardware with appropriate signal processing algorithms using the techniques developed in Phase I. Demonstrate feasibility for effective acoustic sensor system performance for both stationary/ operating and ""on-the-move"" vehicle operation. Conduct laboratory and or field tests - preferably with the experimental system mounted on an Army ground vehicle/weapon platform.

These surfaces have surface figure better than one wave, RMS surface roughness less than 100 Angstroms, and subsurface damage less than two microns. The Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) capability of the Opticam SM machine can now be enhanced via software to predict surface manufacturing errors given machine positioning and alignment tolerances. In the Optical Design Phase, this would be used to predict optical performance of manufactured parts and aid in cost effective designs. In the manufacturing phase, this software would aid in closed loop control of the Opticam SM. Interferograms of manufactured optics would be compared to the desired surface shape to diagnose machine misalignments and yield automatic correction or operator intervention, if necessary. Phase III Objectives: The results of this effort will be incorporated into the MANTECH Optics Thrust Program at the Center for Optics Manufacturing (COM) in Rochester, N.Y. MANTECH programs are planned to be performed at the center for FY93 to FY97. The program resulting from this SBIR would become part of the Opticam (Optics Automation & Management) system software and be implemented in continuing technology transfer at the COM, a consortium of academe and the US optics manufacturing industry.

All Opticam-related projects are directed toward dual-use commercialization for the US optics manufacturing industry.

The result will enable a safer brighter light source with only 10% of the tritium previously required. Phase I: Develop methodology for design and implementation of a system which will produce improved luminous tritium sources in the form of glass microspheres. These sources will be for illuminating instruments used by the Army, Air Force and Navy. Develop and define conceptual lamp designs for two selected Army fire control instruments requiring luminous sources. The improved source will have a five year useful life expectancy goal. Phase II: Develop a full up laboratory prototype microsphere producing system capable of inserting controlled increments of phosphors and tritium gas into glass microspheres. The increments of phosphors and tritium will be optimized to create a luminous source containing a fraction of the tritium gas that an equivalent status quo luminous tritium source would contain. Two optimized microsphere arrays will be fabricated equivalent to two standard types of 10 curie lamps used in Army Fire Control Devices. Potential Commercial Market: The commercial potential is very high in providing safer airline passenger exit signs at lower cost. The tritium sources will enable economical long-life instrument lighting for airline cockpits and motor vehicle cabs. In its final packaged form the tritium radiation hazard will be reduced to being only negligible in severe accidents.

The efficient improved source will use only about 10% of the tritium presently required by DOD systems.

However, experimental beacon tracking systems have been rendered ineffective due to multipath interference. This interference, which is caused by the simulations reception of the direct wave from the source and the waves reflected from the ground, causes tracking inaccuracies. The effect is most pronounced for low trajectories. Until the problem is solved, the use of millimeter waves for tracking and guidance will be limited only to high angle trajectories. This effort will focus on abating multipath interference due to low angle tracking at millimeter wave (at 35 GHZ and higher) over all terrain surfaces. Phase I: This phase consists of laboratory demonstration of multipath reduction techniques and selecting one which best enhances low angle tracking. Phase II: This phase consists of a field demonstration of the technique that was selected at the end of Phase I. Potential Commercial Market: The technology developed under this project can be used to minimize low angle tracking errors due to multipath interference. Aircraft tracking radar performance could be enhanced with the use of this technology, particularly all commercial and recreational aircraft tracking radar. For instance, a commercial aircraft on a final approach to a runway can be monitored and guided by air traffic controllers accurately and without any human interpolation of the aircraft position information. OSCR: Successfully developed technology will enhance low angle tracking and guidance accuracies and therefore, increasing lethality of all gun fired projectiles. With this capability, newly developed tracker and guidance systems will accurately deliver projectiles to the target. This will reduce multiple fire of projectiles to destroy a target, hence, incurring a significant cost savings.",287,1923,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58276/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58276/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:44,,,,,A93-047_58276,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-047,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.307477+00

This problem is compounded when the background noise is random or contains other voices. A voice recognition system capable of locking on to a speaker's voice would enable the system to be operated in a noisy environment and without a special microphone or headset which is currently required to acoustically separate the speaker from the environment. Artificial neural networks are currently being examined to solve this problem and appear to hold the greatest potential, but considerable amounts of conventional signal preprocessing may still be required. Technical issues of interest include noise reduction, speaker identification, language identification and language transcription. Phase I: Develop methodology and approaches for enabling a neural network to learn and identify a designated speaker's voice in a signal containing other voices and random noises. Determine requirements for any signal preprocessing needed by the net, and provide system design specifications.

These sensors operate on non-line-of-sight targets, and are virtually non-detectible because of their passive (non-emitting) operating mode. Improvements in the computational power and speed of microprocessors/DSP chipsets have led to the realization of sophisticated target acoustic emission exploitation capabilities in relatively small, low power consuming packages. Strategically significant targets, such as helicopters and ground vehicles, are characterized for the most part by their low frequency (10-200 Hz) acoustic emissions. This feature makes them particularly well suited to long-range detection in that these disturbances suffer less propagation loss due to ground absorption/impedance effects. Unfortunately, noise produced by local wind turbulents has a characteristic 1/f frequency distribution, which has the effect of masking the most prominent target signature features. Innovative wind noise cancelling/reducing techniques will be developed for implementation on smart mine/ground based acoustic sensor system applications. The research should be geared toward reducing the effects of wind noise on an acoustic sensor located at or near ground level (<.5m AGL). It is desired that the sensor system perform with no degradation in a wind at speeds up to 25 mph. Examples of approaches to the problem might include but are not limited (1) Adaptive noise cancellation using a reference sensor (pressure transducer, microphone, hot-wire anemometer) and innovative signal processing algorithms, or (2) development of improved windscreen geometry or material. This research directly supports Army mission areas: Air-Defense; EMW (such as smart mines); Close Combat (Armor Self Defense); Fire Support (inc. AFAS, FARV, Fire Support Modernization Plan, Artillery Location/Counterbattery). Phase I: Analysis and design of wind noise attenuation technique/device. Use existing data or conduct field measurements of wind induced acoustic noise. Conduct a computer simulation or laboratory/field test to assess the potential performance and technical feasibility of the design concept. Phase II: Construct experimental noise reduction/cancellation hardware and/or software. Demonstrate and validate, preferably using a Wide Area Mine mockup, the effectiveness of the device/technique at wind speeds up to 25 mph. Potential Commercial Market: Useful for commercial applications where wind or other random/non-periodic low frequency noise interferes with the measurement of low frequency signals of interest.

Defects such as cracks or splits could pose a safety hazard to soldiers when firing such ammo from their weapons. The current process for the determination of residual stress in 5.56mm brass cartridge case is accomplished as per ASTM B 154-92 Mercurous Nitrate Test for Copper and Copper Alloys. This test employs a mercurous nitrate solution to test in-process cartridge cases and fully assembled cartridges. Mercury accelerates the cracking or splitting of the cartridge case caused by any residual stress remaining in the case after case anneal. The test requires 30 minutes to complete. Mercury compounds pose known safety and health hazards to personnel requiring that extreme precautions be taken during its handling and use. In addition, the disposal of mercury waste in landfill as is currently done can pose a serious environmental hazard and may become illegal in the near future. It is intended that this program develop a process for the determination of residual stress in cartridge cases which would eliminate the use of mercurous nitrate, a known environmental and health hazard. At the same time this process shall be capable of operating real time in the cartridge case fabrication line at the rate of 1200 cartridge cases per minute. Phase I: A search is to be conducted for the identification of new methods/approaches to residual stress determination which do not have the hazards associated with the current mercurous nitrate test. These methods should be capable of real time operation of 1200 parts per minute. A selection process would be conducted to determine one or two viable processes/tests. This, in conjunction with testing and analysis, would be used to determine the feasibility of utilizing an identified process/test as a replacement for the current mercurous nitrate test. The contractor shall determine the advantages and disadvantages of each test/processes identified as a viable solution to the problem and which meet program objectives. A final determination will be made by the government as to which process will be pursued in Phase II. Phase II: The contractor shall fully develop the most viable process as is determined in Phase I. He shall demonstrate its ability to determine residual stress at an operating rate of 1200 parts per minute. The process shall be capable of performing accurate stress measurements with little or no interference from normal variations found in the manufacturing process such case thickness, trace impurities, case curvature, etc. The process shall be capable of being integrated into the cartridge case fabrication at LCAAP. Potential Commercial Market: The potential for a Phase III effort for commercial applications for this program is considered to be good. Most commercial producers of sporting ammunition and ammunition for law enforcement purposes utilize a mercurous nitrate test for the determination of residual stress in brass cartridge cases. Mercurous nitrate is recognized as a health and environmental hazard. Currently, spent mercury solution is disposed of in a landfill. This method of disposal will be banned in the near future. An environmentally safe and non-toxic method of residual stress determination will eventually have to be found. The results of this effort could be directly applied in the commercial segment of the ammunition market since that also now employ the mercurous nitrate test for residual stress determination in brass cartridge cases. OSCR: The development of in-line non destructive inspection methods for detecting residual stress in brass cartridge cases will result in reduced operating and support costs associated with metal parts fabrication. Presently, the inspection of brass cartridge cases is conducted ""off line"" using mercurous nitrate which requires a minimum of 30 minutes to complete testing. In this time, approximately 36,000 defective cartridge cases can potentially be fabricated before a environmental safety and health hazard. An in-line inspection method would identify a residual stress problem in real time allowing for an immediate change in the annealing process and thereby eliminate a large amount of scrap material. Elimination of the disposal costs of mercurous nitrate is another potential area cost savings. A reduction/elimination of a safety and health hazard and its associated cost not the least of which may be potential legal action/lawsuits would result in additional costs savings.",704,4563,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63359/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63359/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:45,,,,,A93-050_63359,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-050,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.822044+00

There is an Army-wide need to improve the method by which threaded parts are tested. Recent legislation enacted through the Fastener Quality Act, and class 3 safety-critical fasteners, calls for quantitative thread measurement versus quantitative thread gauging. Many of the required inspection parameters cannot be adequately characterized by traditional mechanical gauging methods in use today, especially at the high inspection rates required by 100% inspection and SPC. Measurements of internal threads are particularly difficult because of the mechanical and visual access problems. The accurate dimensional characterization of internal surfaces that contain critical features, such as threads, bearing shoulders, and seal surfaces, has always been a major concern to the U.S. military, their manufacturing representatives, and their QA/QC representatives. This is especially true where functional failure of the part affects the safety or effectiveness of critical machinery used in weapon systems.

Experimental data are being collected on these hazards in the laboratory and in live fire experiments. A workshop on the automatic detection problem yielded a problematic approach to synthesizing automatic detection of hazardous conditions. This effort requires further technology developments in sensory systems, high performance computing capabilities and detection algorithms for application with direct and indirect fire systems. Special interests lie in the potential application of fusion of spectrographic data, focal plane arrays, laser semiconductor arrays and the chemical tagging of ammunition elements. This topic requires: (1) extension in the taxonomy of hazards in cannon/ammunition systems (including the analytical/experimental development of spectral emissions signatures for each type of hazard) (2) characterization of emission for the byproducts of combustion of ammunition (including evaluation of the influence of transmittance on the detection process) and (3) determination of the types, levels and effects of background radiation from external sources. An approach applying the development of neural nets to discriminate between hazardous and non-hazardous states in the gun could be applied. The required algorithms and coding must render a reliable detection in the very limited time available for interruption of the gun loading process.

Attempts to improve the ballistic performance of tungsten heavy alloys have centered on improving the mechanical properties. These attempts, however, have been less than fully successful. Recent investigations to understand the penetration mechanisms using single crystal tungsten penetrators having rod axes parallel to the (100), (110), and (111) directions showed three distinct deformation behaviors and ballistic performances. The (100) orientation had penetration performance equalling that of depleted uranium alloy.

Tungsten heavy alloys (WHA) and depleted uranium are two materials which possess required properties for ballistic penetration. Depleted uranium alloys, however, are more effective penetrator materials. Their ballistic superiority is attributed to their localized failure during penetration. Recent environmental pollution concerns related to the use of depleted uranium have spurred significant interest in enhancing the ballistic performance of tungsten alloys. The current technical approach is to induce thermo-mechanical instability in WHA's by replacing the nickel-base matrix with one or more materials susceptible to adiabatic shear localization. However, since the matrix is a small constituent of WHA, it is unlikely that a new matrix alone can induce localized failure of the whole composite. Thus, to enhance the effect of a new matrix material, it should be concentrated in specific areas of the penetrator rod. Development of a coating/surface modification technology is required to enhance the ballistic performance of tungsten and tungsten heavy alloys. Such a coating must be adherent and crack-free and must be able to withstand ballistic impact.

The environmental pollution concerns related to the use of depleted uranium alloys, however, have spurred significant interest in enhancing the ballistic performance of safer tungsten alloys. Prior tungsten alloy development programs achieved significant improvements in mechanical properties; but failed to realize any improvement in penetration performance. More recent development efforts utilize an approach to induce a thermo-mechanical instability in the tungsten heavy alloys by replacing the nickel base matrix with one or more materials susceptible to adiabatic shear localization. The matrix, however, constitutes only a small percentage of the two-phase composite microstructure. Pure tungsten is the major constituent; therefore, it is unlikely that changes in the matrix alone can induce favorable failure modes. Thus, totally new tungsten alloys based on novel microstructure and advanced tungsten particles are needed to fabricate tungsten heavy alloys with altered and beneficial deformation failure modes. Desirable technical approaches to achieve alterations in deformation behavior of pure tungsten do not have to solely rely on thermal softing to create localized failure, but also should take advantage of structural or microstructural modifications. This may also include preferred orientation of microstructure. Phase I: Synthesize novel tungsten alloys which exhibit altered and favorable failure mode as compared to pure tungsten.

A few possible examples are detection of wall anomalies in projectiles and cartridge cases, measuring the shape of cylinder bores, detection of residual stress and material fatigue, vibrational analysis of turbine blades, detection of disbonds in composites, and poor adhesion in epoxy laminates. Current methods employ holographic film as the sensor medium. Film is not realtime in that it must go through a development process. Also film is not erasable and reusable. Film does not interface well to digital encoding. These attributes severely limit possible real-time automated application of the technology. Bacteriorhodopsin has emerged as one of the most likely organic candidates for a molecular medium light sensor. The spectral transmissivity properties are appropriate for interferometry. Its image retention property is such to make it useful for real-time hologram interferometry, i.e., two images can be taken sequentially with no pause in time and the resulting interference pattern immediately seen and digitized. Images are formed immediately without a development process. Images can be erased in milliseconds and material immediately used to acquire a new image. Resolution is more than adequate for holography. Even though bacteriorhodopsin is an organic molecule, it is stable over many years. This solicitation is for the research and development of a new high resolution real-time interference holographic imaging Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) system. The system should use bacteriorhodopsin as the medium for the hologram. The system should have adequate speed, resolution, and range for real-time interference holography. The system should include a computer interface for digitally capturing the hologram. The system should be appropriate to use for NDT of munition items. Phase I: The contractor shall investigate and prove the feasibility of making a high resolution real-time interference holographic NDT system as described above. The contractor shall find potential sources of venture capital for developing the ""SBIR Phase III"" market. The contractor shall design a prototype system to be build in Phase II. The proposal must show that the contractor has considerable prior experience with bacteriorhodopsin. Phase II: The contractor shall build and deliver a prototype high resolution interference holographic NDT system with characteristics described above, test it, document its operational characteristics, validate its worth, and design a version rugged enough for use in a manufacturer's production facility. Potential Commercial Market: A real-time erasable holographic medi does not currently exist. This project involves the development of such a media and its application to non-destructive inspection. Film, the current holographic media, has very limited real-time applications in automated NDI and even in pure holographic applications. An erasable holographic media will greatly expand possible applications. OSCR: This office has clear evidence that automated NDI is more consistent and accurate than manual methods. This office will use the results of this project for inspection of munition items during or following the manufacture process. The result will be greater confidence in the quality, reliability, and safety of munition items before they are placed in the stockpile. Increased quality, reliability, and safety will lead to decreased logistic costs (fewer items will be required to achieve the same ultimate effect). A measurable effect should be a reduction in quantity of newly manufactured munition items that are suspended. The technique could be used under proper condition for inspection of already suspended items for such conditions as residual stress, cracks, fissures, and voids.",558,3831,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63136/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63136/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:50,,,,,A93-063_63136,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-063,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.822044+00

Concepts developed must continue to provide the desired cushioning properties to protect the munition during packaging rough handling environments.","The fast cook-off and sympathetic detonation tests are two IM tests and are described in MIL-STD 2105A. Ideally the advanced cushioning developed under this topic should address both the fast cook-off and the sympathetic detonation test criteria. However, if that is not possible, only one criteria may be chosen to be addressed. Many munition containers are constructed with a steel outer container. Polyethylene or polyurethane foam, bound fiber, or some other cushioning surrounds the munition to provide protection from the impacts and shocks of rough handling and environmental conditions. The IM fast cook-off test subject packaged munitions to a large fire. The required reaction of the munition in these tests is burning only. The tests do not have a time limit, but are conducted until the munition energetically reacts. Two possible approaches which use the packaging cushioning to protect munitions during the IM fast cook-off test are discussed. One approach is to use the packaging's cushioning to thermally insulate the munition from the fire. This will delay the munition's reaction time. Although a delayed time will not directly help a munition to ""pass"" the IM test, it will contribute a significant real world explosives safety benefit by providing valuable time to allow personnel to either fight the fire or evacuate the area. A second approach is for the packaging cushioning to undergo a phase change from solid to gas. This phase change may absorb thermal energy, thereby insulating the munition. This approach may provide a secondary benefit of providing an internal pressure build-up within the container due to ""out-gassing"". This internal pressure may be engineered to result in controlled rupture and venting of the container, in contrast to the current reaction, which is often a rapid build-up of pressure culminating in a release of dangerous fragments. The IM sympathetic detonation tests and the hazard classification stack test evaluates the likelihood that a detonation reaction may be propagated from one unit to another within a group or stack of munitions. The required reaction of the acceptor munition in these tests is no detonation. Because this test is usually conducted with munitions in the packaged configuration, the packaging has the potential to mitigate and attenuate the explosive shock transferred from the donor to the acceptor munition. During the investigation, the maximum cushioning material used shall be four inches. The materials developed shall meet toxic fumes requirements as established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. The results of this investigation may benefit the IM performance and hazard classification of many Army munitions. The outbreak of fire in an ammunition storage area is widely recognized as the greatest hazard to explosive safety. This effort will reduce the consequences of this hazard, thereby greatly improving the safety of U.S. troops and civilians. Phase I: Investigate new and innovative materials, coatings, and designs for packaging cushioning to protect munitions during the IM fast cook-off and sympathetic detonation tests while still providing the desired cushioning properties to protect the munition during packaging rough handling environments. Modeling and analytical evaluation shall be used to predict the success of the concepts. To address the fast cook-off test criteria, cushioning shall be developed which delays the time of reaction for a munition exposed to the IM fast cook-off tests. To establish a baseline, the investigator shall determine the insulating performance of currently used polyethylene and polyurethane foam and bound fiber. In addition to cushioning materials which provide thermal insulation, materials may be considered which may dissipate thermal energy by undergoing a change of state, such as from solid to gas. The ""out-gassing"" developed during this state change shall be quantified to determine internal pressure build-up leading to controlled rupture and venting of the container. Small scale testing using a heat source shall be used to simulate the actual fast cook-off test and will demonstrate the success of the various concepts. To address the sympathetic detonation test criteria, cushioning shall be developed which provides explosive shock attenuation, thereby increasing the likelihood of preventing sympathetic detonation. To establish a baseline, the investigator shall determine the explosive shock attenuating performance of currently used polyethylene and polyurethane foam and bound fiber. Phase II: Implement the new cushioning concepts into actual munition containers. The prototype designs shall be tested in IM fast cook-off, sympathetic detonation, packaging simulated rough handling testing, and toxic fumes testing. Modified container designs shall not adversely affect container performance in simulated rough handling tests or toxic fumes test. The prototype designs shall be optimized for producibility and cost. Detailed design drawings and specifications shall be developed. Potential Commercial Market: This technology would have application to the commercial packaging industry and fire protection industry. The development of new and innovative packaging materials, coatings, and designs would provide improved fire and heat protection for many commercial goods, with particular application to expensive and sensitive assets.",811,5480,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58209/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58209/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:51,,,,,A93-065_58209,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-065,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.822044+00

The reclaimed NC can be utilized to support current and future production.","The Conventional Ammunition Demilitarization Inventory (B5A Account) contains large quantities of single-base propellants (including M1,, M6 and M10) contained in bulk form and in munition items. Disposal by open burning/open detonation is currently being utilized. This practice must be phased out due to environmental restrictions. Controlled incineration of bulk propellant and explosive is a potential solution. However, reclamation and reuse is the preferred approach since this technology offers both environmental and economic advantages. Technology development will permit the recovery of nitrocellulose (NC) from single-base gun propellant. The feasibility of recovering strategic ingredients from Class 1.1 and 1.3 large rocket motor propellant formulations using CFE technology has been demonstrated using near critical liquid ammonia as the extraction solvent. This technology is currently being transitioned for pilot scale development by the Joint Service Large Solid Rocket Motor Research and Development Program. A similar process using a different extraction solvent requires evaluation for application to conventional gun propellants. Phase I: Set-up laboratory equipment to demonstrate critical fluid extraction can be employed to recover useful ingredients for recycle and reuse utilizing various extraction solvents. Testing will be performed to proveout the concept of extracting nitrocellulose (NC) from single base propellant using critical fluid technology. Different extraction solvents will be evaluated to perform the recovery. The optimum solvent will be identified. All solvents must be environmentally acceptable and capable of being completely recycled. Phase II: Design, install the process equipment and perform bench scale testing on various single base propellant formulations using the optimum solvent identified in Phase I. Design criteria will be developed to transition the technology to the pilot phase. The physical and chemical properties of the reclaimed material will be evaluated in order to optimize the extraction process. In addition, a cost analysis will be performed to determine the economic advantages for proceeding to the pilot plant stage. Potential Commercial Market: Critical fluid extraction technology is a proven technology that can be commercialized for recovery of NC from single base propellant. The technology can be implemented at GOGO/GOCO facilities to support ammunition production, consequently eliminating the need for disposal by open burning/open detonation. The CFE process involves the fluidization of gases to near critical liquid and supercritical fluid conditions. The fluid serves as the extraction solvent based on the solubility of the solute. The solubility of the solute in the solvent changes rapidly as process control parameters such as temperature and pressure are varied. Understanding the process chemistry based on the ingredient solubilities permits the extraction of the ingredients for recycle and reuse. Development of CFE process under the SBIR program for single-base gun propellant formulations will allow tangible and intangible benefits. The conventional ammunition demil inventory will be reduced in a more environmentally responsible manner by eliminating the need of open burning/open detonation. The CFE approach will provide a new source of raw material. The reclaimed NC can be utilized in the production of small caliber munitions to reduce manufacturing costs. OSCR: The SBIR proposal to develop critical fluid extraction technology for recovery of NC from single-base gun propellant formulation will provide the most efficient environmentally acceptable alternative to open burning and open detonation for conventional munitions. Recycle and reuse of NC will also support future production readiness. the technology can also be readily applied to extract and recover strategic ingredients (NC, NG, and NQ) from multi-base gun propellants. The objective of this proposal is to develop a cost efficient critical fluid extraction process to recover and reclaim high purity NC from off-spec and obsolete single-base gund propellant formulations. In addition, ammunition maintenance operating efficiency will be maximized by the recovery and recycle of NC. The estimated quantity of obsolete single-base gun propellant in the demilitarization stockpile is in excess of 10 million pounds. A cost savings at a minimum of $10 million can be realized through successful development of this program.",641,4497,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58210/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58210/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:51,,,,,A93-066_58210,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-066,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.822044+00

Using the selected gun system as a baseline develop ammunition concepts which embody barrel wear reduction additives. For each concept developed predict barrel life improvement, cost of implementation, estimate the caliber range and duty cycle in which the concept would be applicable.

These are: mapping of the relevant decision environment (constructing a representation of the cause-and-effect relationships among the salient factors with which the position incumbent must deal); envisioning (constructing a communicable concept of an end state toward which complex activity can be directed); and long-range planning (constructing a path which will over a long time frame -- 15-25 years or more -- achieve a communicated end state). Coloring all these processes is a probable requirement for some degree of preference for innovation (proclivity to think outside bounded and well-defined solutions). Little is known about the development of these processes and their precursors. Phase I: Phase I will require the development of a theoretical model that identifies and incorporates the three complex processes identified above, and the fundamental cognitive processes that underline them. A substantial amount of work has already been done toward this end. Phase I may therefore be considered a validation of that work. In Phase I, the existing conceptualization will be re-examined to confirm that it is consistent with the existing literature, and to determine if the literature identified developmental order effects. Phase II: Phase II will require the design of ""blueprints"" for the construction of courseware designed to produce significant development of these complex cognitive processes. In addition, Phase II will require the completion of a demonstration module, with before and after measures, that successfully increases the performance level of students in these three areas.

The Army, however, is facing reduced training budgets. Training to achieve required collective (group) proficiency demands efficient, imaginative training strategies, especially for training command and control planning tasks potentially trained and rehearsed in synthetic environments. A key research issue is the question of the contribution of pre-training of sub-groups (e.g., S1-S4 elements or G1-G4 elements) before these elements are brought together for full-group mission training. Research is required to determine representative, and if possible, generalizable functions relating amount and type of sub-group training to group training performance. Four major sources of training variance are of concern: part-task vs. whole task training, skill acquisition vs. transfer-of-training, massed vs. distributed practice, and effects of prior knowledge. The literature on these areas should provide useful points of departure. Recent engagement simulation data have shown problems in performance where command and control staffs had not been trained as sub-groups before being brought together as a staff in realistic simulated exercises. While the focus could be on combat command and control planning and operations, surrogate tasks may be more suitable for this effort. Phase I: The anticipated result of Phase I is a research plan and pilot data. The plan should include a focused and selective review of the literature. It should also include a preliminary model of sub-group functioning in a group context and provide a rationale for experimental task selection and research design. Pilot data should be sufficiently conclusive to warrant a full-scale study in Phase II. Phase II: Based on the collection of more extensive data, this phase should result in a set of functions and conclusions relating amount and type of prior sub-group training to group training and performance. The data from this phase should be sufficiently conclusive to warrant refinement of the model so that it can be used for selection of the most cost-effective sub-group/group training strategy. Potential Commercial Market: The results of this research can have wide applicability to training in security organizations such as law enforcement and fire fighting. The results will also apply to many group tasks in business, industry, and non DoD government agencies (e.g. emergency relief) where sub-groups, pre-trained in component tasks, are convened ad hoc, for special projects, or as permanent teams.",388,2631,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63319/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63319/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:53,,,,,A93-071_63319,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-071,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.822044+00

Oil switch configurations presently in use include V/N and rail edge-plane spark gaps that have been developed during the last 15-20 years. New applications such as SREMP testing require the development of a more precise triggering mechanism with emphasis on reproducibility of streamer initiation, number and spatial distribution of streamer channels, and characteristics that will reduce simulator risetime. The advanced oil dielectric spark gap should be scalable for use in small and large pulse power applications spanning the parameter space including: gap potential 100 kV to 12 MV; switch energy up to several megajoules; currents 10kA to > 1 MA; and electric fields-50 kV/cm to 300 kV/cm. Phase I: Perform an experimental and theoretical investigation of the proposed concept. Design and perform a proof-of-concept experiment (POCE) which demonstrates the superior performance of the POCE device and determines the feasibility of scaling the switch concept for application as the output switches for the AURORA simulator. Phase II: Further develop the switch concept for scaling to small and large pulse power systems. Design, construct, and test improved spark gaps as the output switches for the AURORA Blumlein pulse forming lines. Potential Commercial Market: Advanced oil dielectric switches have several potential applications in the commercial sector. These applications make use of the high dielectric strength of transformer oil and the reduced flashover constraints that make high pressure, gas spark gaps and plasma/gaseous electronic switches expensive and complicated to manufacture. The principal applications of the switching technology to be studied are in ultra-wideband impulse radars (UWB), accelerators for industrial processing, and as alternatives for superpower thyratrons. UWB radars can permit high resolution measurements at long range. G. Mesyats (Russian Academy of Science, Urals Div.) reported on such a radar system at the recent BEAMS '92 conference in Washington, DC (May 1992). Many such systems use a high pressure spark gap switch and achieve a 1-2ns risetime. However, oil switched systems in the US and elsewhere have obtained much faster risetime, but the triggerability, jitter, and reproducibility of such systems is not as good as gas dielectric switches. This is largely because very little basic R&D has been performed on oil switches i the last 15 years. Recent observations at AURORA (ARL in collaboration with Berkeley Research Associates and NIST) suggest that significant improvements are possible. Electron accelerators for industrial processing have long been in development. However, the commercially viable accelerators use conventional gaseous electronics switch tubes, e.g., hydrogen thyratrons, or spark gaps. Generally, such accelerators have low peak power and high average power. Applications such as pulsed lasers, super-power-electron beam welding, material modification, and radiation processing that might require high peak power have faced limitations because of opponent lifetime and reproducibility. Switches are a principal limitation. In this case, oil switches offer an alternative that has not received sufficient study. Finally, oil switches may offer a lower cost alternative to the super-power thyratrons that are being used for high power modulators that drive high power microwave sources. Such thyratrons cost 50-100 k$; oil dielectric spark gaps switches are expected to cost an order of magnitude less. The microwave systems have military application s that will soon make major changes in the way warfare is conducted. In addition, these microwave systems have applications similar to the industrial uses of electron accelerators, namely material processing and manufacturing.",574,3944,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63302/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63302/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:33:55,,,,,A93-075_63302,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-075,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.822044+00

The model provides the scientific underpinning for the theoretical and experimental simulation of the LP effects. Using high velocity impact mitigation techniques coupled with mechanical dampers and filters, controlled high-frequency structural oscillations may be synthesized, spectrally shaped, and directed into the projectile/component structure at impact inside gasgun devices (2"" to 7"" caliber). This capability is critically needed to validate the survivability and capability is critically needed to validate the survivability and performance of new concept/prototype projectiles, components and submunitions designed to operate with the new family of guns. Phase I: Develop a Lumped-parameter model which combines structural-dynamic effects (geometry-dependent wave-propagation behavior, time-dependent loading rates, constitutive material properties) and crush mechanics/dynamics of impact mitigators (aluminum and steel honeycomb cylinders and cones), to describe the onset, dissipation, and decay of the oscillatory LP loading throughout the projectile/component structure as a function of time (t up to 50ms).

These delays are often so severe that they obviate the benefits of carrier sensing algorithms. Resolving collisions and retransmitting packets result in excessive delays in message delivery, especially under the severest conditions of combat. In addition, slotted Aloha suffers from unacceptably low throughput. On local area networks (LANs) token ring protocols provide a means of avoiding problems associated with packet collisions, but such protocols have not yet been adapted to radio channels. We propose to use silence as the token (permission to transmit). Each user is assigned an arbitrary position in a virtual ring. After a station completes a packet transmission, only the next station in the ring has permission to transmit (i.e., has the token). If that station does not transmit, the following station will wait a prescribed amount of time (which accounts for propagation and equipment delays, uncertainties in knowing the time, etc) after which it will ""have the token"". Phase I: Perform design and analysis of a packet radio protocol which mirrors the operation of token ring protocols used in modern LANs. Consider the following: accuracy and resolution with which a node can know the time; the size (in units of time) of the token; effects of timing errors; effects of nodes dropping out of the net or attempting net entry. Phase II: Conduct experimental demonstration of the token ring packet radio protocol with a minimum of four nodes.

Additionally, this characterization is important for the test, evaluation, and development of smoke and obscurant defensive and countermeasure systems. In order that this characterization be accomplished in three-dimensional space, as opposed to single lines of sight, multispectral imagery is a major part of the instrumentation suite used under field test conditions. The analysis of these data requires that the smoke cloud be identified and then segmented from the scene under study. In most situations, the cloud radiance/luminance is nearly the same as the background against which the observations are being made, which causes automatic segmentation schemes based on edge detection to fail.

Turbulence will dramatically affect the amplitude of sound propagating from battlefield targets and the Line-Of-Bearing measurements to the targets. The types of turbulence involved are the temperature and wind structure parameters.

New ideas for active HTSC devices (e.g. fluxonic, flux flow transistors, etc) demonstrating gain and/or rectifying action are needed to facilitate the construction of integrated front ends. The HTSC materials can be any of the recently discovered ones such as the Bismuth-, Yttrium- or Thallium-based ceramics. Because of their expected end use in fielded systems, the only constraint on the operating temperature is that they function properly at temperatures easily attainable by closed-cycle, single-stage refrigerators (i.e. 40( Kelvin). Phase I: The Phase I effort should include a thorough study of the current state of the art in active HTSC devices, the advantages and disadvantages of each, and their potential for use in active systems. Also, the fabrication and testing of one or more of these active devices should be demonstrated under a range of frequency, temperature and power conditions. Phase II: The Phase II effort will incorporate the novel HTSC devices into a functional HTSC RF subsystem. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of active HTSC devices, it is anticipated that this RF subsystem will utilize HTSC-based active devices for low-noise amplification and for mixing.

Utilization of this wide frequency spectrum results in a unique system applicable to the areas of impulse radar, remote sensing, communications, and weapons. The frequency spectrum of the impulse is widely spread, and therefore the energy allotted per frequency interval is small. In addition, the radiated power from a single ultra-wideband RF source is limited mainly due to the switch breakdown strength. The power limitation of the individual RF source can be overcome by operating arrays of these RF sources. A critical technological barrier is in the phased array technique, in which arrays of these radiators produce a constructive wavefront, so that an extremely high radiated power at the far field can be achieved. Phase I: Phase I should result in mathematical formulations correlating the triggered time sequence of the radiating elements with a constructive wavefront formation in the far field. The operating sequence for the array of RF radiators involves charging and discharging the elements at controlled time sequences. The timing sequences of this array are controlled in such a way that the radiated waves result in a constructive wave in the desired direction of space. A rigorous computer simulation is required for the follow-on proof-of-concept demonstration. Phase II: In Phase II, the proof-of-concept field demonstration will be performed. Radiated waveforms from arrays of photon-triggered ultra-wideband RF generators, comprising a reasonable number of RF radiators, will be measured in the far-field.

As a result of fires, enemy personnel may be killed and their vehicles or weapons made inoperable, or personnel may be wounded--physically or psychologically--and their vehicles or weapons may sustain some degree of damage. In either case, the ability of the enemy to attack or defend is decreased. The extent to which suppression versus kills hinders the response of the enemy, has not been adequately quantified to be incorporated into fire support simulation. Typically, the use of fire support in simulations results in either a kill or no kill. When no kill is assessed, there are no other suppressive effects imposed on the enemy due to the delivery of fires. Suppressive effects caused by such things as (a) personal injury, (b) psychological stress, (c) equipment damage, (d) visual obscuration of the battlefield, or (e) navigational problems due to restricted visibility or cratering of the surrounding terrain need to be addressed in future simulation models. This weakness, inherent in the current simulation models, decreases the external validity of the simulation for fire support. Thus, in order to increase the utility of fire support simulation in MANPRINT-related studies, variables affecting fire support suppression must be identified and their singular and synergistic effects quantified. Phase I: The purpose of Phase I will be to determine the feasibility of quantifying the nonlethal effect of fire support on personnel and equipment. This will include identifying the nonlethal effects of fire support on the battlefield and proposing a method for quantifying their impact on battlefield performance. Phase II: The purpose of Phase II will be to select critical variables, from those identified in Phase I, and quantify their impact on battlefield performance. The resulting algorithms will be incorporated into the Target Acquisition Fire Support Model (TAFSM) maintained at the U. S. Army Field Artillery School (USAFAS), and a proposal to update the Janus simulations will be prepared for consideration by Janus software proponents, TRAC-White Sands Missile Range. Improvements to the Janus simulation software will allow the Army Research Laboratory to use the Janus simulation to examine weapon system performance during acquisition and product improvement phases. Potential Commercial Market: Models and simulations for training and weapon system acquisition or enhancement are used extensively by both government agencies and private industry. The impact of fire support suppression on battlefield performance is not portrayed adequately in the currently available models and simulations. Thus, any improvements would be incorporated into existing models and simulations and used in the development of new systems.

The direct substitution of tungsten alloy for uranium alloy is not possible due to performance differences between the two. DU alloys, as KE penetrators, perform 5 to 10% better, depending upon test method and conditions. The performance gap has been attributed to an adiabatic (localized) shear that occurs in the DU alloy that prevents the formation of a mushroom head on the nose of the penetrator. The lack of a mushroom head allows greater penetration. Tungsten alloys that have been considered are two-phase composites in which the minor phase acts as a binder for the tungsten phase. The binder is composed of nickel with iron, cobalt and/or copper. Several efforts have addressed the replacement of this binder with ones that should be more susceptible to a shear localization in an effort to mimic the DU behavior. These have not been successful.

The thicknesses of these high performance coatings are generally on the order of 0.05-0.1 microns, much thinner than commercially available hardcoatings. Although fabrication techniques recently developed for producing such ultra-thin film materials or coatings on temperature sensitive polymeric substrates have shown much progress, our understanding of the micromechanical properties of the interfaces at these extremely small dimensions lags far behind. A device is needed to measure the micromechanical properties to assess the adhesive strength and fracture toughness, and to evaluate the micromechanical failures of critical high performance protective hardcoatings used in Army systems.

One of the most attractive advantages of thermoplastics (and conversely one of the least attractive aspects of thermosets) is an unlimited shelf life at ambient temperature. From a practical logistics standpoint, this feature is superb. It eliminates the task of ratio mixing the resin components and, more importantly, eliminates the need for refrigeration and special handling. On the other hand, thermosetting systems are much easier to process, making them the more popular matrix resin system despite the fact that they have a limited shelf life (even when refrigerated). A mixed, ready-to-use thermoset resin that does not require refrigeration or special handling, with properties similar to current resin systems, would be an important practical advantage to the military and industrial community.

One of the threats facing Army materiel in the field is contamination by chemical warfare (CW) agents. Although these agents are delivered in the form of small droplets, they represent considerable danger to personnel. Undetected agents on the surface are an immediate hazard. Subsequent decontamination treatments may or may not completely neutralize them. In addition, agents may diffuse into the organic matrix. Surface decontamination may not neutralize interior agents, which can then diffuse back to the surface after days or weeks to recontaminate the surface, unbeknown to personnel. A nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technique is needed to alert personnel to dangerous CW contamination on the surface or just beneath the surface of composite materials. Critical regions of the structures must be scanned, perhaps by an optical or spectroscopic means or by generation of surface color changes by an applied detection medium. Next to be performed could be local heating of the surface by a hot air gun or radiant energy source, followed by scanning as above, to reveal any significant subsurface contamination. The proposed NDE system must be field-portable, easy to use, environmentally benign, and not harmful to the composite materials.

Bond quality implies at least a semi-quantitative indication of bond strength.","At present, a major barrier to the optimum utilization of adhesive bonding as a joining method in primary structure in Army materiel is the absence of a NDE technique capable of indicating bond quality and thus, structural integrity. The extent to which this is a barrier may be judged by the position taken by the aerospace community: ""IF YOU CAN'T INSPECT IT, YOU CAN'T FLY IT."" Current techniques, such as ultrasonic inspection and infrared(IR) thermograpy, are capable of detecting voids and delaminations, but these defects usually have little to do with bond quality. An extreme case in this regard is the so-called ""kissing bond"" in which there is intimate contact between adhesive and adherend, but no bond exists. This condition cannot be detected by current methods. Since bond strength is determined by and deterioration most often occurs in the interphase region of a bond, techniques which can provide information as to the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of this region are required as a basis for new approaches to bond quality NDE. Instruments/equipment to be derived from any such new approach must be factory as well as field deployable. Phase I: Identify a particular approach to be taken and show feasibility by demonstrating a strong correlation between predicted bond quality for a range of appropriately flawed test specimens and the results of destructive testing of these same specimens.

There is often a trade-off made when chemical resistance is required, in that other polymers with less desirable physical properties are selected. Ion beam modification may provide enhanced chemical resistance without altering bulk physical properties. The process will not suffer from bond delamination, as chemical resistant coatings can, since ions are implanted below the surface and become a permanent part of the material.

While interferers are greatly attenuated (60 dB), all other desired signals pass through with negligible effects. It is desired that multiple interferers can be attenuated without prior knowledge of their location in the spectrum. This device should also exhibit a 60 dB spurious free dynamic range, minimum insertion loss (less than 10 dB), and minimum ripple (less than 1 dB). Other desired features are small size, weight and power consumption. Phase I: A Phase I effort should consist of a technology study to determine the feasibility of a frequency selective limiter with the above characteristics. With such technology limitations, what best effort can be achieved? Two prototypes of the selected design should be assembled with measured data and delivered. Phase II: A Phase II effort should concentrate on extending the frequency selectivity bandwidth and dynamic range not achieved in Phase I. Improving insertion loss and ripple, and minimizing size, weight, and power requirements is desired. Potential Commercial Market: The requirements for commercial application is to use wider modulation bandwidths and less transmit power in their radar and communication equipment. This is driven by cost savings of less transmit power. This also causes the potential of narrowband co-located transmitters to interfere with wideband equipment. The requirement for wideband frequency selective limiters is to suppress narrowband interferers without distorting the entire modulation bandwidth.

This would directly support the precision strike S&T thrust.,"If it were possible to build accelerometers with sufficient accuracy, resolution and range, then both the large forces (>16,000 Gs) experienced by an artillery projectile during gun launch and the much smaller forces experienced during flight could be measured. By combining these data with the gun coordinates and orientation, the projectile's trajectory would then be fully determined. In addition, the existence of such accelerometers would make inexpensive inertial reference units possible for guided projectile applications. Because the research done to create such ideal accelerometers has shown little progress, it seems unlikely that the necessary technology will emerge in the near future. However, an alternative approach may be possible, one which takes advantage of the Global Positioning System (GPS). To be specific, it may be possible to protect a sensitive low-dynamic-range accelerometer during the gun-launch interval using caging methods or temporary restraining structures such as electrically-fusible links. Although launch acceleration would not be measured, the initial attitude could be accurately inferred and subsequent changes in attitude would be used for GPS receiver aiding. It should be noted that the basic scheme is not new. Various Global Positioning System (GPS) location-mapping devices are now available as options in certain luxury automobiles. Some employ micro-machined accelerometers or inexpensive, rate-integrating vibratory oscillators (vibratory gyroscopes) to estimate vehicle motions during intermittent periods when GPS satellite signals become blocked by structures or terrain. As the first step in an innovative research effort, it is suggested that existing devices be investigated to ascertain gun-ruggedness. Phase I: Perform analyses and evaluations to determine the accelerometer and gyroscope technologies best suited to produce low-cost devices which will operated after gun launch (17000 G) acceleration. Phase II: Continue detailed studies into small, inexpensive accelerometers, gyroscopes, etc. and demonstrate hardware suitable for the gun-launch environment. Potential Commercial Market: The potential commercial market for micromechanical inertial measurement units has been estimated at 20 million units per year. applications in the automobile industry include airbags, breaking, leveling, true skid detection, and augmentation to vehicular GPS navigation systems. Additional commercial application can be found in products such as camcorders, general aviation, medical electronics, and perhaps one of the largest areas of all, children's toys. (Source: Poth, T.

This valve must operate and be controllable to frequencies high enough (150 Hz) to be used to locally influence the performance of a circumferential segment of a given compressor rotor.,"Recent research has indicated that the inception of a flow disruption in compressor rotors known as ""rotating stall"" can be delayed by locally affecting the flow conditions of the critical compressor stage rotor. The flow conditions might be locally modified using bleed behind or fluid (air) injection in front of the rotor. This would result in improved performance for the compression system. To accomplish this task, a valve is required that can cycle from full close to full open to full close at a speed of approximately 150 Hz. The valve would be sized to pass a maximum of approximately 1.65 ft(3)/sec of air at standard day conditions.

The concept developed shall be extendable to multibarrel configurations.,"General - Damage tolerance and fabrication cost are driving issues in the design of composite primary structure. Some success has been achieved in the reduction of fabrication cost by utilizing textile technology to produce dry fiber preforms. Improvements in damage tolerance is achievable through toughened resigns and through-the-thickness (TTT) reinforcement. Methods of producing TTT reinforcement are stitching and tufting and integral weaving of braiding. The integral weaving or braiding of preforms with TTT reinforcement is applicable to a limited range of structure. Stitching and tufting have been only applied to flat or structures having slight curvature, such as wing skins. Stitching has typically been limited to preforms of less than an inch of thickness. Stitching is a slow method of inserting TTT reinforcement. For example on a typical wing skin of a commercial transport wing using a nominal stitch density of 60 stitches per square inch, 4 to 5 million stitch penetrations are required. utilizing a state-of-the-are multi-needle machine operating at 1hz required hundreds of hours to stitch a single wing skin. Furthermore, a thick stitched structure must be stitched to final shape because the stitched preform will not readily conform to other shapes without severely distorting the inplane fiber architecture of the preform. An alternate approach to stitching as a method of TTT reinforcement is to shoot a discontinuous rod (possible a cured composite rod) through the thickness of the preform. The technique envisioned is similar to a nail gun used in building construction. In this case instead of a fixed length nail, a continuous supply of rod would pay out, cut and loaded into the gun. Depending upon the thickness of the preform, its permeability and the type of fibers in the preform, the propellant (probably air) would be adjusted and the rod shot into the preform. A fully-automated high-speed, multi-barrel gun of this type would have many advantages over current stitching method of TTT reinforcement. Preforms could be assembled and debulked on the infiltration and curing took prior to the insertion of the TTT reinforcement. This would reduce the manipulation of the preform between stitching tools and infiltration and curing tools. It would also eliminate the need for stitching tools. Preforms having complex shapes and curvatures could be accommodated whereas this is not the case with stitching. Furthermore, preform thickness would not be an issue with a gun system. A gun system could be operated at rates approaching a machine gun firing rate which would reduce the time required to reinforce a large preform. The discontinuous nature of the rod TTT reinforcement eliminates the bending of inplane fibers which reduces compression strength of stitched composite laminates. Phase I: Design, build, and demonstrate a single barrel gun for TTT reinforcement. Phase II: Build and demonstrate a fully-automated high-speed, multi-barrel hun for TTT reinforcement.",465,3009,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58231/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58231/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:34:19,,,,,A93-141_58231,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-141,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:45.822044+00

If it is anticipated that this modified reed will require substantial computer control.,"Reduced fabrication cost and structural weight can be achieved in a composite structures through the development of advanced structural concepts. These advanced concepts are producible utilizing textile technology provided it is possible to change the angles to the warp yarns. When the fill yarn is inserted into the shed formed by the warp yarns and beatup into the fabric, the fill yarn conforms to the surface of the reed's dent wires. If the woven fabric is a unweave construction where the warp yarns represent only a few percent of the total yarn in the fabric, then the fill yarns are the only structural yarns in the fabric and the width of the fabric is controlled by the spacing of the warp yarns. Therefore, the reed plays a major roll in defining the architecture of the fabric. If it is possible to simultaneously change the shape of the reed during the weaving of a fabric, a significant cost and weight benefits could be achieved.

However, detailed modeling of nonlinear anisotropic rotor blades places an increasing burden on the analyst to prepare input data. The finite element analysis of a composite rotor blade structure would normally require costly three-dimensional methods. However, orders of magnitude less expensive beam methods can be used by first performing sectional analysis to determine beam properties. The sectional analysis of a complicated beam-like rotor blade need only be done once if the blade is spanwise uniform, or only a few times to accommodate typical mild spanwise nonuniformity. Sectional analysis is a two-dimensional problem, the domain of which is a local cross section.

Unfortunately, using these new codes is often quite cumbersome because of the need to supply the large quantities of data needed to define the major components of the rotorcraft model (i.e., structural model, aerodynamic model, control system model), and to guide the complex solution algorithms. The Second Generation Comprehensive Helicopter Analysis System (2GCHAS) is a large, multidisciplinary, computer software system designed to analyze the performance, stability and control, aeroelastic stability, loads and vibrations, aerodynamics, and acoustics characteristics of rotorcraft. Developed by the Army to provide a significant increase in rotorcraft analysis capability, 2GCHAS provides state-of-the-art capability in modeling and analysis. 2GCHAS uses finite element methodology to analyze structural dynamics, and will be adding Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) capabilities for enhanced aerodynamic analysis. In 2GCHAS, the use of menu-driven selection, coupled with formatted data entry screens and help files, offers some on-line guidance to the user, but the menu hierarchies can be confusing to the user. The personal computers and workstations that have recently appeared incorporate novel, graphics-based user interface concepts that, when applied to comprehensive rotorcraft codes, could dramatically enhance user interfaces with these codes.

When a gas turbine engine experiences a compressor stall or surge, the given mission will be effected slightly or significantly. In cases of severe surge, the engine or drive train components can fail, causing loss of engine operation. When this happens on airborne platforms, the results can be catastrophic. Surge/stall has three causes: 1) engine deterioration, 2) aerodynamic distortions (especially at the air inlet), and 3) hot gas injection (from weapon firing). With modern technology, it may be possible to design new gas turbine engines, or modify existing ones so that occurrences of surge/stall are nearly eliminated. This can be done by implementing innovative control techniques using Digital Electronic Controls and fast temperature and pressure sensors, or by using methods that change the internal aerodynamics of the engine in order to actively avoid surge. Some of these methods are: movable plenum walls, air injection into the compressor, oscillating fuel flow, bleeding air from the compressor, actuating variable geometry etc. Using these techniques, it may be possible to reduce the required surge margin and operate near the surge region, thereby, running the engine at a more efficient speed.

Although carbon and graphite fibers have some electrically conductive properties, advanced composite structures can be characterized as empirically non-conductive in the lightning strike, high-frequency, and some other radio frequency environments. Graphite composites can be considered conductive in the ultrahigh and radar frequency ranges.

Within the military, navigation and route-planning expert systems have been developed for optimizing cover and threat avoidance, while similar systems exist for commercial aircraft diversion logistics and weather avoidance. Fault diagnosis, system maintenance, and fault recovery reconfiguration expert systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated on both civil and military platforms. Information management systems are being prototyped to deal with the profusion of communication and information exchanges made possible by improved transmission and display technologies. Unfortunately, each of these model-based systems is being developed in relative isolation. A significant challenge yet to be addressed is the integration of these model systems in a dynamic environment. Individual model update rates must be coordinated and references to other expert system models must be explored in order to avoid the likely condition of conflicting system advice. A reported incident in relatively low-tech commercial aircraft operations illustrates the problem. While in a multiple aircraft holding pattern, a TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) issued one of the aircraft in the pattern an executive level alert to dive. A subsequent cascade of dangerous actions resulted from the tightly coupled nature of the operations system. Similar precision and tight operational tolerance is experienced in the flight deck. Methods must be investigated to assure that conflict resolution among highly automated systems is not simply left to the flight crew or the ground operations controller. Information concerning the interaction of joint automated experts should be supplied to the human operators of those systems if they are to have the responsibility for coordinating and deconflicting them. An analysis method is required to determine by what information, time frame, protocols, and procedures is the human operator to deconflict expert guidance. We are entering a system environment in which the current standby ""turn it off"" is no longer an acceptable option.

Due to the limitations of the model material and the relative accuracy versus the actual part, the model is unsuitable for testing. Phase I: Develop a design for a rapid prototyping system capable of producing solid models suitable for limited functional testing. The system should be able to utilize geometric data from currently used computer aided design (solid modeling) systems. The system should produce models with strength, dimensional accuracy, and thermal stability significantly above those currently available using stereo lithography. The effect of process variations on accuracy and stability shall be determined. Unique technical aspects of the system design should be demonstrated by bench testing. Results of this testing will be used to evaluate the concept's potential for successful development. Small gas turbine engine components such as cooled turbine blades, compressor rotors/blades along with aircraft structural components such as weapons and sensor installations and environmental control systems installations are of primary interest. Phase II: A detailed design of the entire rapid prototyping system shall be conducted. A prototype of this system shall be fabricated. Small gas turbine engine or airframe manufactures shall be contacted to obtain trial part geometries. Several different trial parts shall be prototyped and subjected to functional testing. The ability of these tests to reproduce the component performance characteristics shall be evaluated. Potential Commercial Market: If successful, the technology resulting from this topic would be applicable to a vast array of commercial products/markets. Companies producing aircraft, ground vehicles, gas turbines, internal combustion engines, electric motors, and many other commercial and residential products involving mechanisms and/or energy conversion would greatly benefit. All the major producers of the above products employ rapid prototyping systems to some degree in their current development activities. A system with the advantages to be developed by this topic would allow these companies to drastically reduce the time and cost of bringing new, high-quality products to market. A direct competitive advantage would be gained by companies utilizing this technology.",519,3695,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58238/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58238/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:34:29,,,,,A93-167_58238,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-167,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:46.325581+00

Extensions to this approach would be of direct benefit in the Army aviation environment. However, elements which contribute to a quantification of risk in the Army domain can be much different from civil counterparts, such as flying nap-of-the- earth or with night vision goggles. This effort will research and identify those factors in today's Army aviation which contribute to risky missions, and then use these factors to develop a decision aiding system for operational aviators. Some of the required information for such a system may be available through the review of accidents and incidents. However, this is a select database--risky missions often do not result in accidents. Therefore, a study performed at operational units is appropriate for a useful tool. Once adequate data is gathered, modeling the subsequent findings may result in a simple linear regression, if that captures enough of the variance. Otherwise more complex combinatorial rules will also have to be explored. The chosen knowledge and methodology can then be embedded within an automated system and subjected to validation studies. The decision aiding system resulting from this topic will help to determine, objectively and reliably, if the risks of a potential mission are outweighed by its benefits, as well as aid with material allocation, (i.e., two helicopters may reduce the risk to acceptable levels). Such a system can also be used to indicate when a higher authority is needed. For example, under low risk conditions the pilot may have authority to approve the mission, while higher risk sorties may dictate approval by the company commander prior to flight. Phase I: This phase would consist of: 1) initial data collection, literature review, 2) studies at operational units to investigate factors leading to risky missions, and 3) initial development of the candidate algorithms to combine the factors to predict the risk of missions. Phase II: This phase would consist of several parts: 1) testing and selection of the most appropriate combinatorial rules, 2) the development of the software and interface that would serve as the pre-flight risk assessment system, and 3) preliminary validation studies. Potential Commercial Market: The commercial application and interest for this topic is demonstrated by the present work (performed) in the EMS industry). A similar topic was also chosen for a joint research initiative between NASA Ames and a commercial partner. Once a system such as this has been developed, it may logically be extended to other services and environments.

Categories of information already envisioned for the HMD include flight, weapon, target acquisition, navigation, system, obstacle avoidance, virtual switching and warnings. Research has shown that this would lead to pilot information overload. Advances in intelligent information presentation as well as prioritization and filtering of flight mode information needs to be achieved to obtain an essential high level of performance during low altitude night operations. Manual mode selection of display information in use today was developed in the late 1970s. Manual mode selection does not take advantage of data bus and electronic cockpit monitoring systems that could provide automatic and intelligent information updates. Manual mode switching also increases pilot workload and often results in unnecessary display icons that clutter the pilot's synthetic environment. Current technology does not provide the intelligent information presentation requirements necessary in future aircraft. Phase I: Using several design principles, identify and evaluate innovative flight and mission information mode switching concepts necessary for Army Aviation. Then, using a baseline which is representative of current technology, select several candidate intelligent information prioritization/filtering techniques to demonstrate the potential increase in pilotage and mission effectiveness. Phase II: Preliminary evaluations of intelligent information presentation concepts for a HMD will be performed in both ground and in-flight simulation to verify improvement potential.

However, all of the characteristics mentioned above need to be accomplished by onboard sensors that are severely limited in size and weight.","The proposed effort is to be part of the Free Flight Rotorcraft Vehicle (FFRRV) program being conducted jointly by the US Army and NASA Langley. The FFRRV program is developing the technology to perform dynamic agility, stability, control, and acoustic research using instrumented, free flight, reduced-scale powered rotorcraft models having Mach-scaled wind-tunnel model rotor systems. The free-flight rotorcraft program is in part an outgrowth of the fixed-wing drop model program which has become an essential part of the development of all high-performance military aircraft. The significant difference between the rotary-wing and fixed-wing programs is that the helicopter models must be powered and are therefore subject to all of the dynamic handling quality issues of full-scale helicopters, but amplified by the smaller scale of the research vehicle. Development of a telepresence capability can provide the model helicopter research pilot with considerably enhanced sensory environment, necessary for nap of the earth flight (NOE). Although the telepresence research is to be conducted on helicopter models, the technology is wholly transferable to the fixed-wing activities at Plum Tree, and to the UAV, flight test, and robotic communities at large. Even though there have been a number of studies aimed at providing remotely controlled systems some measure of telepresence capability, the technology is immature and there are few precedents on which to rely for guidance. However, it is widely recognized that stereoscopic vision with a field of view around 180 degrees will be desired. Although high resolution is only needed in a small range around the focal point of the eyes. Moreover, the technique has never before been attempted at this scale for research flight vehicles having the level of performance expected from the Free-Flight Rotorcraft Research Flight Vehicle (FFRRV), and there are several unknowns in solving the telepresence problem. For example, the required tracking rates and damping characteristics for vision systems needed for flight operations are not well defined. These are also severe video sensor system weight and size constraints on unmanned vehicles of this scale. This technology offers not only enhanced research capabilities for model flight research conducted at Langley, but also has exciting implications for full scale flight testing, hazardous environment operations for all forms of automotive vehicles, combat, reconnaissance, and surveillance activities, and robotic applications. Phase I: The expected results of the phase I SBIR would be the complete design of the stereoscopic video sensors, the control system for the helmet tracking system to steer the sensors, and a telemetry system for the transmission of the stereoscopic video data to the ground station. This design must be sensitive to the volume, and weight restrictions of the free flight research vehicle.

Examples of these might be the utilization of single crystal turbine vanes and blades, and various other investment cast structural components. It is not unusual for these components to experience varying degrees of cracking and/or wear. If this damage progresses beyond allowable limits, component removal will be required. As it is well known, structures such as single crystal airfoils are very expensive to replace. For this reason it is very desirable to repair the components and return them to service. It will be the intent of this program to survey and identify potential processes which may be capable of providing the means to effectively repair or refurbish high-dollar value components. Phase I: The Phase I effort shall consist of several activities. First, a thorough survey of the turbine engine industry, as well as Government/industry operated repair facilities, will be conducted to develop a definitive understanding of current and anticipated repair limitations and requirements for a matrix of high value components. Available data should be compiled which indicates actual and anticipated component failure rates, component damage/failure mechanisms, and actual or anticipated component costs. This data will be needed for cost benefit analysis and repair process identification. A second survey will be performed to identify those repair/refurbishment techniques and processes possessing the highest probability of providing a cost effective repair of high value components. It must be remembered that identified repair/refurbishment processes should not possess known limitations in their ability to return a component to usable condition. Repair processes must not degrade the mechanical integrity or component functional characteristics. An assessment of anticipated repair cost(s) associated with the processes should be conducted and an initial estimate of component(s) life cycle cost improvements made. Following the survey activities, a detailed assessment of the most promising repair/refurbishment techniques should be conducted. This would be anticipated to include an assessment of repair practicality, and repair effectiveness with respect to durability, quality, and yield. Sub-scale trials of the identified repair/refurbishment processes should be conducted to allow for preliminary assessment of the mechanical properties of repaired structures and initial screening of processes and processing parameters.

Process parameter refinement requirements will be identified following a preliminary repairability/refurbishment demonstration. Mechanical property screening tests will be conducted to identify potential repair problems. Following preliminary repair trials, necessary process refinements shall be incorporated into each of the selected processes and full-scale component repairs will be demonstrated.

These include the ability to operate at high temperatures and high speeds. The lubrication system could be eliminated, resulting in lower weight and reduced logistic support considerations.

The use of magnetic bearings requires auxiliary bearings to support the rotor while power to the magnetic bearings is off, if the magnetic bearing fails, and during transient conditions when the maneuver loads are too great for the magnetic bearing to handle. The engagement and disengagement of auxiliary rolling element bearings at full rotor speed will impose unique dynamic conditions on the bearings.

Current DoD efforts are defining and projecting those capabilities. Multiple sensors, displays, and communication systems will allow greater mission effectiveness and a high degree of autonomy on the battlefield. Global deployment will require protective climate and chemical protective subsystems. One of the critical shortcomings has been identified as a lack of very high power density power sources to support the various subsystems that the individual soldier will be using. These range in power from 1 to 3 horsepower combined with a 50 to 100 watt generator with controls for basic systems to 5 to 10 horsepower source with hydraulic pump for supplying high pressure oil for an ""augmented"" externally assisted soldier.

These mines target the magnetic signature of vehicles allowing precision full vehicle-width attack. The Vehicle Magnetic Signature Duplicator (VEMASID) system was designed to defeat these mines by projecting a magnetic signature ahead of the vehicle. VEMASID was Type Classified for Low Rate Production in Feb 91; however, the user subsequently decided that the cost of the system was too high and terminated the program. The intent of this effort is to demonstrate more affordable techniques and technologies to protect vehicles from MIF mines using magnetic signature duplication. The system will be required to actuate at least 95% of MIF mines in a path 1.2 times the width of the vehicle in the battlefield operational environment. The requirements of the VEMASID ROC (Required Operational Capability), 19 Feb 86, apply. The ability to defeat multi-axis magnetic influence fuzes is desired. Phase I: This effort would result in a brassboard system suitable for testing on an M109 Howitzer and data sufficient to support a conclusion that the system could be made affordably. Phase II: This would extend the development to fabricate engineering prototypes for environmental, reliability and performance testing and to more fully develop affordability data.

The best method for providing power and air conditioning for a mobile operation is to take full advantage of the carrier engine and batteries. This means that the carrier engine should run an air conditioner and a high capacity battery charger system to provide operational power and air conditioning (Army ambulances have such a system). However, in situations where full power from the engine is required by the carrier for transport or in situations where it is not practical or fuel efficient to run the carrier engine, an on-board auxiliary power and air conditioning unit is needed to provide DC power and air conditioning. The DC generator and air compressor could be belt driven to optimize engine size, rating and weight. An electrically controlled hose and valve system should be used to utilize existing air conditioning components, including the evaporator and air handling systems. The shelter power distribution system would be from a common DC buss. This approach for providing on-board power and air conditioning for mobile operations provides equipment redundancy and should assure a high availability for power and air conditioning without having to tow trailer mounted generator sets. It should provide the maximum weight allowance for mission equipment. It would have an added advantage of eliminating separate DC power supplies now required for much of the typical communications equipment and allow the vehicle batteries to be used for an uninterrupted power supply. A 30 percent decrease in the weight and fuel consumption of the APU might be realized. Phase I: Preliminary design and breadboard testing of the power generation air condition system.

The impact is that the 30 frame per second HCT staring Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) have sensitivity little better than Platinum Silicide (PtSi) Staring FPAs. Input circuits with well capacities an order of magnitude grater than PtSi in similar sized unit cells would provide significant sensitivity margin over PtSi that could be traded for smaller optics, etc. The technology used here would also permit capacitors with small physical size in SCANNING unit cells and leave room for other functions. Phase I: During this phase of the program a study/investigation will be made to determine material, processing techniques and capacitor architectures that could lead to an increase in the capacitor's well capacity. Other storage circuits which could possibly replace the capacitor will also be investigated. Concepts to be implemented in Phase II will be identified.

Insight comes from smart use of software management metrics. Managers need assistance in making decisions concerning; whether or not metrics will be helpful; what measures; and what resources, are required; what corrective actions are available and reasonable to apply; and, which corrective actions represent acceptable risk. The decision system should include an informational subsystem, to answer questions on metrics program implementations, that is based on input provided to a menu-driven query subsystem which addresses system technical approach and programmatic priorities. This subsystem will help a manager decide on a metrics program and its specifics, and provide information on the most useful measures. The decision system will also be used for sensitivity studies, to do trade-off analyses of resource requirements. For on-going metrics programs, it would help decide alternative courses of corrective action based on metric reports and correlations. Flexibility is needed to accommodate existing metric sets, and how each addresses primary manager concerns. Use of management metrics is now widely accepted as an effective means of providing managers control of their projects based on their priorities, risks and constraints. Metrics support the concept of ""building quality in"", and thus will lead to significant cost savings in the area of maintenance and support of deployed systems. The proposed management metrics decision system will be a major contributor to building quality systems and reducing operational support costs. Phase I: Demonstrate proof-of-concept and feasibility.

A VMEbus RF down convertor is a natural compliment to the wide range of high performance signal processing boards available for the VMEbus. An excellent selection of Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit (MMIC) devices, a simple Intermediate Frequency (IF) plan and well understood noise mitigation practices allows this design to be developed with only a moderate amount of risk. The IF strip will contain a sub-octave preselector, digital attenuator and two signal paths: direct current (DC) to 10 Mhz to 1800 Mhz. The DC to 10 Mhz path will be preselected, amplified and directly digitized using a 25.6 Mhz sampling analog to digital convertor (ADC). The 10-1800 Mhz path will be upconverted to a first IF of approximately 3700 Mhz. The second local oscillator (LO) will down convert to a common IF of 70 Mhz, and the third LO will baseband to RF to a 6.4 Mhz center frequency with a 10 Mhz wide bandwidth. This module is expected to utilize one 6U VMEbus slot. The 10 Mhz analog baseband output will be supplied through the front panel. Commercially available components will be used throughout. The local oscillators will be supplied by a second VMEbus card. Target performance will be tuning speeds of less than 100 usec with very low close-in and wideband phase noise. This module is expected to utilize one 6U VMEbus slot. Phase coherence among LOs would make the down convertor suitable for direction finding. Local oscillators will be supplied through front panel connectors. All control functions will be programmed via VMEbus. Full Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) P.1014 compatibility will be required. Proper attention to design details will ensure the VMEbus noise problems are successfully minimized. Phase I: The contractor will investigate the IF plan and choose the RF components (connectors antenuators, switches, mixers, amplifiers and filters) to implement the design. Careful attention will be given to noise abatement and RF shielding. The LO module will also be designed. The IF strip will be simulated using spur and noise figure analysis. A final report with schematics, parts lists, and simulation results will detail the Phase I effort. Phase II: The contractor will construct the down convertor designed during Phase I.

If such features can be shown to exist, the remainder of this effort will be focused on the development of an algorithm which can automate the benchmark feature selection process, as a function of script, and make use of this information to accurately navigate inter- and intra-script contexts. Phase I: Development of mathematical proof which will prove or disprove the existence of contextual benchmark feature information as described above. Phase II: If the existence of such benchmark features can be proved, automate the benchmark feature selection process, as a function or script, and show that this information can be used to accurately navigate inter- and intra-script contexs.

However the systems are composed of multiple types of different digital technology: specialized signal processors; general purpose computers; fast personal computers; signal analysis workstations; and application specific integrated circuits. These components (as line replaceable items or circuit card assemblies) must be stocked as spares and configuration managed separately. Operational and Support (O&S) costs are driven by the numbers of different items that must be maintained in the inventory. The highly parallel architecture as now used allows consideration of a system composed of common digital processing components for almost all functions. Although the common digital processor may be more expensive than any one component now used, the large number, even in low density equipment field applications, of the same component can reduce production costs and O&S costs. The common processor must account for the high data processing speeds needed for high dynamic range, 4k to 16k point Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), signal acquisition/analysis in milliseconds in dense environments and real time multiple signal ECM response. This may be accomplished with common processors through the use of innovative algorithms, special application chips host common, lower performance, processors or a combination of approaches. Phase I: This will be trade-offs of various candidate architectures, simulations of the response of these architectures for performance and estimates of resulting O&S cost reductions to be achieved. Key issues are ways to handle both low and high speed functions, input and output translations, data bus and signal path optimization and producibility/costs per processor/function. Driving point functions and their sensitivity must be identified. A final technical report will describe in detail the results. Phase II: A single real time operating breadboard thread of the selected architecture and components will be assembled to verify performance and better refine O&S cost reduction estimates. The deliverables would be the architectural design of a system based on the breadboard and a final technical report.

PLCs have many advantages over current HVAC control hardware, but will not be considered for Army wide use until the capability to perform energy management functions is proven.

The incorporation of antibodies into this type of vector system may also allow the cloning of reporter molecules, such as enzymes or fluorescent-proteins, adjacent to the antigen-conjugates to be made by genetic engineering techniques rather than through separate chemical reactions.

Some of the fentanyls are widely used as injectable anesthetics. Others are being studied as wildlife and veterinary tranquilizers. Many of these compounds are well-characterized, rapid acting, very potent and reliable in their activity. However, for many LTL applications, they have safety ratios that are too low and durations of action that are too long. Ideally one needs a material that will act safely, virtually instantaneously and last for just a few minutes. Thus, candidate chemical immobilizers with improved safety ratios and shorter duration of action are needed. Phase I: The feasibility phase of this program should result in the identification of one or more candidate LTL materials. In some situations, for example, close encounters, such as domestic disturbances, barroom brawls and stopped motorists or for rescue missions, materials should optimally be extremely fast-acting (few seconds), very safe and relatively short acting (few minutes). In other situations, such as barricades, speed of onset and duration of action may be less important, but safety will still be of paramount interest. Thus, it is desirable to identify more than one candidate material. It is preferable that a candidate material(s) should include the following steps: determination of the ""state-of-the-art""; selection of candidates for preliminary evaluation; acquisition of test materials; and animal tests to indicate sufficient efficacy and safety to warrant further study. Phase II: During this phase, further tests should be conducted to: establish effective doses and safety ratios sufficient for human estimates; establish times for onset and duration of effects; assess the effects of stress on effective dose and safety ratio; identify and conduct other toxicology tests necessary for human testing; and provide information for dissemination techniques and delivery devices.

The goal of this project is to produce FRP guardrails that have been tested for environmental durability and highway safety performance and are ready to be marketed.,"Highway and roadside safety is an ever-increasing concern for the Army, other DoD Agencies, the Federal Highway Administration, and state highway departments. Highway guardrails are presently manufactured from common materials such as aluminum, steel, and concrete. The use of a new engineering material, Fiber Reinforced Plastics (FRP), has been proposed for applications where a standard W-Beam guardrail has previously been installed. Because of improved crash worthiness, light weight, and corrosion resistance, application of FRP in the construction of guardrails is attractive for higher safety and lower costs in erection and maintenance. Since many thousands of miles of W-beam located along roadways exists both nationally and internationally, there exists significant potential for widespread use of FRP guardrails for infrastructure rehabilitation. Phase I: The contractor will investigate current manufacturing processes and develop new techniques to produce FRP W-beam-profile guardrails. Required physical properties include a minimum tensile strength of 70,000 psi and Young's modulus of 3,000,000 psi. Results of this work will be documented in a report. Samples of the prototype FRP W-beam guardrail totaling 100 ft. in length will be provided. Phase II: The contractor will conduct laboratory testing and analysis to evaluate mechanical performance of the produce including effects of cold weather, ultrviolet light degradation, water resistance and flammability. The product will be subjected to full-scale vehicle crash testing at a Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) test facility, and after a successful testing, approval of the FHWA will be solicited to install the experimental guardrail on highways. As a minimum, six locations in the United States will be selected covering different climatic zones, from the very hot and humid environment of the south to the severe cold climates of Alaska. The installed guardrails will be monitored for a year for indication of any degradation, or if any accidental crash has happened, the modes of failures.

Likewise, the density of ice formed on objects by supercooled fog and sea spray are necessary to calculate loads caused by icing. Small errors in measured density can make large differences in calculated loads or properties. Two methods currently favored for measuring density are the mass-volume technique and submersion method. In the mass-volume method, the sample is weighed (usually on a portable electronic balance) and the volume measured with calipers. For the submersion technique, the sample is weighed in air and a fluid of known density, and the ice density can be quickly calculated. The submersion method is accurate on bubble free ice, but large errors occur on ice with connecting surface channels. The difficulty with the mass-volume method is generally the accurate determination of volume due to surface irregularities. A field portable method of accurately measuring ice density to an accuracy of 0.002 g/cm (cubed) is required. Sea, lake, and river ice is normally collected by core sampling resulting in samples that are 6 to 15 cm diameter cylinders (depending on auger diameter) and can be 2 to 25 cm in length. Sea spray or atmospheric ice samples may be a variety of shapes or configurations, some with volumes of only a few cm (cubed). Some ice may be permeable, thus, submersion techniques may not be appropriate. It is preferable, but not absolutely necessary, that the technique be non-destructive. Instrumentation and tools for making the measurements should be made rugged, and be packaged such that it can be deployed by one person (making several trips if necessary). AC power will often only be available from a small generator (l.5kva) at the field sites. The measurement technique should work in temperatures ranging from 0 to -40 degrees C. Phase I: Determine the feasibility of developing instrumentation to accurately measure ice densities in the field conditions described above. Design and develop a ""breadboard"" system and prove the feasibility of the technique in laboratory tests. Phase II: Make necessary modifications to Phase I concept and development then design and fabricate a prototype system. The prototype system will be used in field tests to demonstrate its applicability.

However, there is a great deal of information in the near-infrared spectral signature (l.0 - 2.5 microns) of most earth materials, which allows identification and classification in remote sensing data, as well as more accurate specification of the wavelength-integrated albedo for energy balance calculations. This project requires systematic application of knowledge about large array sensing elements, spectral sensitivity of sensor materials, and integration of instrument packages with small computers to develop a light-weight near-infrared field spectroradiometer. Equipment is required that will reliably, accurately, and rapidly measure spectra in the 1.0 - 2.5 microns wavelength region, which is suitable for field use. High spectral resolution (more than 60 channels) is required. The instrumentation should be light weight and battery powered, it should have a sensing element that allows for easy pointing in any direction, and it should be able to store, manipulate, and display measured spectra. Moreover, communication with standard computers, PC's or workstations, should be straightforward. The system should operate in a wide variety of environmental conditions.

This project requires systematic application of knowledge about polarimetric radar systems, and integration of instrument packages with small computers to develop a dual frequency field-portable polarimetric FM/CW radar. Field operational equipment is required that will reliably, accurately, and rapidly measure backscatter in two frequency bands centered at 35 and 95 GHz.

This methodology will be packaged in a user friendly PC based expert system, which will be oriented towards project engineering staff.","There are several problem areas to be addressed in this effort: 1. The usual LPS design specifications are concerned mostly with preventing side flashes: that is keeping the lightning current confined to the rods and cables comprising the LPS plus all the other metal and electrical grounding circuits which are electrically connected to the LPS. This design criteria favors the protection of building structure and the prevention of fires in combustible structural elements or the presence of flammable vapors. The criteria can compromise personnel and equipment safety in some cases and does not consider the effects of the electric and magnetic fields or internal objects connected to the LPS, nor the proximity of assets to any of the elements of the LPS. The geometrical arrangement of the LPS and the connected metals and electrical grounds will dictate the vulnerable geometrical locations of the assets, because electric and magnetic field intensities have a spatial dependence in and around the LPS. 2. The vulnerability of assets to direct or indirect effects may not be known precisely enough to judge the ""safe"" areas within a facility-LPS system. Conversely, the facility-LPS system may exist or be built without knowing the vulnerability of assets it may need to protect in the future. However, an existing facility may be ""rated"" at a particular ""safety level"" and statistically ""safe locations"" within the facility may be declared. It may then be determined whether or not a particular asset is ""safe"" within that environment. 3. Any asset oriented approach needs to be easily available and understandable to a non-lightning expert. Phase I: 1. Categorize the threat tolerance of typical assets to both direct and indirect effects. (There may be several operational configurations of a particular asset with varying degrees of exposure to threat). 2. Determine safety levels within the working volume of typical existing facilities using testing and mathematical modeling of typical facilities. 3. Determine optimum geometries for LPS design in future facilities given a set of typical assets which need protecting. 4. Obtaining generic sensitivities to electrostatic discharge (ESD) will require analysis i.e., primary explosives, pyrotechnics, propellants, high explosives, and vapors, dust and gases evolving for specific operations. 5.

Candidate TSPS and RTSPS are evaluated for efficacy, safety, stability and compatibility with other soldier use and chemical agent detection systems. Another critical that must be fulfilled is user acceptability. However, since these materials are regulated by the fda as drugs, human testing for user acceptability cannot be performed until the products are well along in the developmental process. To move this to an earlier stage of development, an in vitro or animal model test is required that would allow an assessment of user acceptability. The test must be validated by human testing and serve as a good predictor for user acceptability. Phase I: Survey, test and establish methodologies that permit assessment of the characteristics of topical creams and ointments using an in vitro and/or an animal model that can be correlated with human user acceptability. Specifically, correlates of subjective human assessments of tackiness, oiliness and smoothness should be sought. Considerations of methodologies to accomplish this goal should include rheological, resistance, shear and interfacial tension measurements, but should not exclude other methodologies. Development of models should consider the use of a collagen matrix, leather or human skin equivalents as potential in vitro examples and the hairless guinea pig (HPG) as the in vivo animal model.

Army helicopter personal restraint systems that will allow no more than 2.5cm Of webbing extension exclusive of webbing stretching lock under all potential crash conditions. Inadvertent lock activation during normal use shall be minimized.","Current restraint system locking devices are activated by strap acceleration and utilize a pawl and ratchet mechanism to lock the reel. This technology has allowed unacceptable upper torso flailing during army helicopter crashes resulting in serious and occasional fatal injuries to pilots. This situation has been compounded in ""crashworth"" helicopters equipped with energy attenuating landing gear and crew seats where crash force onset rates and peak accelerations experienced by the occupants are markedly reduced. Resolution of this problem will require the development of new concepts in webbing locking devices. It is desirable for the device's lock activation to perform independently of the occupant's torso displacement since the intent of the restraint system is to prevent occupant motion. An activation reliability level of 100 percent when subjected to various crash loadings is desirable while maintaining minimal inadvertent activation during normal flight duties. Phase I: Review current state-of-the-art technologies in the aerospace and automotive industries and explore new ideas in sensing crash force accelerations and providing restraint system locking.

However, the mission requirements of the next generation of tactical missiles will demand a level of propulsion system flexibility that cannot be met with a solid rocket. On-demand thrust control will be required which will dictate the use of non-traditional propulsion systems such as: turbojet, ramjet (liquid or solid), air turbo ramjet (liquid or rocket), bi-propellant rocket, monopropellant rocket, hybrid rocket. All of these propulsion systems have a common functional element in that in order to achieve on-demand thrust variation, some form of control is required. Regardless of the specific propulsion cycle, the engine controller will require the same basic functionality - an external throttle command signal must be received by the controller, data must be acquired from control system sensors, and an output signal must be transmitted to a throttling device. Due to the functional commonality of the required control system for each of the throttleable propulsion systems, it is desirable to develop a generic engine controller that can readily be adapted to each specific application. The desired engine controller shall be digital and utilize a microprocessor as the central controlling element. The controller shall permit digital inputs to receive throttle commands and other external information. The controller shall have digital outputs to transmit information to the missile system and to command discrete events. A number of analog input channels shall be provided to receive sensor data. A number of analog output channels shall be provided to drive analog control devices. The controller shall be fully programmable to accommodate the specific logic requirements of the engine. The controller shall be modular in nature and shall be configured to accept input and output signal conditioning modules which are specific to the control requirements of the given engine. The generic controller shall be designed for a minimum unit production cost. Commercial technology shall be utilized to a maximum extent. The final control system is envisioned to consist of a generic control module combined with a number of more specific (but multi-application) input and output modules. The control system shall be a self-contained, stand-alone system requiring only throttle input commands. A unit production cost estimate shall be generated. Phase I: Under the Phase I effort, a detailed design for the generic engine controller and interface modules shall be generated. The programmability and functionality of the central control unit shall be demonstrated either through a bread-board system or through a personal computer based system.

Phase II: Under the Phase II effort a production-ready configuration of the control unit and of the interface modules shall be designed, developed, fabricated, demonstrated, and delivered to the Government for evaluation.

Unstructured grids have been used for many years in the area of structural analysis using finite element methods. It has only been in the past few years that this gridding technique has been applied to the coupled set of partial differential equations of fluid dynamics as opposed to the set of ordinary differential equations used in finite element structural analyses. In particular, these grids have been used very successfully for stage separation problems in multi-stage missiles. However, these solutions have been obtained only for the Euler formulation of the governing set of partial differential equations. To date, there has been no truly successful application of unstructured grids to viscous problems; yet, a successful application of these techniques to a viscous problem would revolutionize computational fluid dynamics by providing a method to solve problems with complex geometries and strong viscous dominated characteristics. To overcome this limitation, research is required in the following areas: 1. Non-orthogonal grids - The use of non-orthogonal grids have led to unstable solutions which become more unstable in direct proportion to the non-orthogonality of the grid. Algorithms are sought which do not exhibit this trend. 2. Numerical turbelence - The generation of numerical turbulence in a CFD solution is affected to a great extent by the skewness of the grid. This trend needs to be investigated to determine what factors are important in the algorithm that enhances or suppresses this numerical turbulence. 3. Turbulence model/Grid Interaction - Depending on the turbulence model used, e.g. algebraic or TKE, the CFD solution becomes more or less stable. This phenomena needs to be understood such that less sensitive solution algorithms can be developed. Phase I: Technical approaches will be formulated for research into each of the above problem areas. At least one innovative approach will be executed through numerical experiments to assess the feasibility for improvement. Phase II: The additional approaches formulated in Phase I will be finalized, executed, and documented leading to the incorporation of an unstructured grid capability not an existing Government computational fluid dynamics model. The advanced CFD model will be run for a series of test cases which can demonstrate the ability of the unstructured grid methodology to treat viscous dominated problems. Potential Commercial Market: The past few years has seen an enormous growth in both the development and application of the computational fluid dynamics throughout commercial industry. The revolutionary and innovative application of unstructured grids to viscous dominated problems would open a vast new area to the application of computational fluid dynamics.",443,2962,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63413/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63413/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:35:11,,,,,A93-280_63413,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-280,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:46.8448+00

The solution approach dictated for this Small Business Innovation Research inherently produces both a development cost reduction and also an Operation and Support Cost Reduction for Software Maintenance/Support Costs. An important by-product of neural network and fuzzy logic methodologies is a decrease in the mathematical scope and complexity and an increase in the prototypical (incremental) design technique's frequency, resulting in a decrease of the time and labor (cost) necessary for the intensive and intricate design/maintenance analysis. Cost reductions will also be realized by: using less expensive sensors and microprocessors; the ability of such an item to ""learn to adapt"" to it's environmental cues; the ease in modifying the system through changing: either the rules describing the system's operation, using natural language, and/or the graphical representation of the system; and the increased stability, robustness, and efficiency of the system (when compared to conventional and/or man/machine systems).

Unfortunately, silicone rubbers have very poor barrier properties to chemical warfare agents. Similarly, other elastomers have desirable characteristics for CP gloves, such as fuel resistance (nitrile and epichlorohydrin rubbers), or ozone resistance (EPDM elastomer), but do not provide the necessary resistance to CW agents. Using a process called chemical grafting, it may be possible to modify the surface of elastomeric gloves and thus enhance their chemical resistance. This technique, which could be used as a finishing step in the manufacturing process, involves the attachment of selected monomers with desirable properties to a backbone substrate through the growth of ""whiskers"".

Under conditions in which there are no internal or external constraints, such motion exhibits basic characteristics that contribute to efficient performance. In reality, however, human motion is rarely performed without some encumbrance. Heavy loads, personnel protective clothing, fatigue and a variety of other extraneous factors may seriously compromise performance. When individuals perform specific tasks (e.g., lifting, reaching, and walking), it is important to quantify the motion changes that are imposed by nonstandard conditions in order to predict the dynamic changes that occur when unexpected demands are placed on the biomechanical system. More importantly, defining movement strategies that will significantly improve performance in critical situations can be accomplished by a biomechanical analysis of motor behavior using ambulatory monitoring techniques. Ambulatory monitoring refers to the use of a continuous recording system to evaluate kinematic function in the actual performance state. Typically, a miniature portable device is attached to a subject during performance of a specific activity, and the desired information is recorded automatically for later retrieval. The major advantage of this method is that it employs instrumentation that does not physically restrict the subject and it allows a given task to be performed under normal conditions without the use of artificial laboratory environments. Using such monitoring devices, the ultimate goal of the project is to derive biomechanical solutions that will enable the soldier to function in a more efficient manner during the execution of critical tasks. Additionally, a record of movement is made throughout the duration of the task which can be decomposed and provide input for graphical analysis of motion using computerized human models. Phase I: During this phase, an ambulatory monitoring technique should be selected and used in an empirical study of one military task performed under normal and atypical conditions. A biomechanical analysis should then be made, demonstrating that it is possible to form quantifiable and functionally meaningful distinctions in performance among various environmental conditions. Phase II: Phase II should: (1) expand the Phase I empirical study to a larger set of military-related tasks; (2) make available a graphics software system for immediate viewing of the experimental data, in the form of recreating the experimental trial with an animated human figure; (3) develop a predictive model that will accommodate untested circumstances; and (4) derive results for enhancing soldier performance under nonstandard conditions. Potential Commercial Market: Ambulatory monitoring is widely used in the medical field. Cardiac and neurological assessments have been enormously improved by such monitors. An ambulatory monitor for kinematic and kinetic data acquisition together with evaluative procedures will have significant commercial potential, particularly in the field of rehabilitation, as a unique clinical instrument for disability assessment and patient management.

Although the processing is done in real-time, some intermediate results are also recorded and are available for post-mission analysis. Since position and velocity information are also available from numerous ground sensors, the best trajectory estimates should be obtained by combining the GPS data with the data from the ground sensors. In order to do this in an optimal manner, it is necessary to have error models for both the GPS and the ground sensor data. Error estimates of the GPS position and velocity are supplied as part of the real-time solution; however, these errors are the result of a complex processing procedure which prevent the user from assessing the validity of the output errors, modifying any of the input components, or determining concomitant information such as time correlation. Phase I: Investigate the error model used in the current GPS/TPS solution to isolate the basic input error parameters and quantify them. Determine the mathematical models used to propagate these input errors into the final position and velocity errors. Determine which errors can be reduced by post-mission processing and quantify the expected improvement. Phase II: Develop a practical method by which GPS data and ground sensor data can be combined in a trajectory estimator in a reasonably well balanced manner. This phase of the study should address such issues as: methods of combining the highly correlated GPS solution with the relatively independent radar and optical sensor errors; identification of significant GPS error inputs which can be corrected and/or estimated in a post-mission environment, and the possibility of estimating GPS error parameters via post-mission regression analysis.

This system is intended for use in combat vehicles. The system will provide protection against eye-damaging lasers which operate at wavelengths throughout the visible portion of the spectrum.,"Because of the expected appearance of multiple-wavelength and wavelength-agile lasers on the modern battlefield, emerging combat vehicles will require laser protection for all wavelengths throughout the visible spectrum. Research is currently underway to develop a protection mechanism which has a high visible transmittance for low input energies, but a very low transmittance to high input energies. Current technologies under investigation do not have the dynamic range necessary to meet the requirements of the Army's unity magnification vision systems. Also, most of the technologies currently under investigation require a focal plane in order to activate the low transmittance characteristic needed to attenuate high input energies. A unity magnification vision system with only one focal plane would be impractical, since the viewed image would be inverted. Although an erecting prism could be used to re-invert the image for viewing, it is unlikely that this approach would provide acceptable power limiting performance. Two focal planes would most likely be required in a usable unity magnification vision system. Current Army unity magnification vision systems do not have a focal plane at all. The present challenge is designing an optical system which has two focal planes and which improves on the limiting characteristics of the laser power limiting materials. One plausible approach may be to design the system such that the two focal planes are within two separate laser power limiting materials arranged in series. In addition, it is hypothesized that a lower optical switching threshold may be achieved in a system that focuses the incident energy to two spots which are coincident or very close to each other within the same laser power limiting material. Both approaches should be investigated, along with others which the contractor may conceive. The optical system should be designed such that it can be tested with several different laser power limiting materials. The refractive index of most of these materials falls between 1.3 and 1.6. The field of view required under this effort is + 40 degrees (80 degrees total). Overall physical constraints are: height < 16"", width < 10"", thickness < 4"". Emphasis should be placed on high visible transmittance at low energies and a low number of elements. Phase I: The contractor shall propose optical designs which meet the objectives as outlined above for a double focus unity magnification vision system. The design must not use any ultra-violet curing adhesives (since these degrade over time) and must address lifetime limitations of the system (if any), to reduce the need for replacement of the item after initial implementation. The government will evaluate the proposed design to determine its potential for integration with laser protection concepts and for its use in combat vehicles. The deliverables from Phase I shall include design drawings, a ray trace of the designs provided on disk utilizing a common ray tracing program (provided on disk with the program) and a final report. Phase II: The contractor shall fabricate the vision system and perform a complete optical analysis of its performance parameters and aberrations. Complete optical and mechanical drawings of the fabricated system shall also be delivered with the vision system along with a final report. Potential Commercial Market: This device would be ideal for viewing experiments within a test chamber which mat abruptly explode or otherwise emit a large amount of visible energy unexpectedly. In the event of such an occurrence, this vision system would prevent the hazardous high energy light from damaging the viewer's eyes. OSCR: It is requested that the design not utilize ultraviolet curing adhesives, since these degrade over time, and that the lifetime limitations of the system be addressed in order to eliminate the need for replacement of the item after initial deployment. The current vision devices are replaced every few years. It is the aim within this effort to eliminate replacement costs altogether.",634,4067,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58272/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58272/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:35:27,,,,,A93-323_58272,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_A93-323,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:46.8448+00

The human eye is most susceptible to laser radiation in the range of wavelengths from 400 to 1400 nanameters and must be protected throughout this region. The non-visible portion of this spectral range should be denied access to the eye by fixed attenuation. Transmittance in the region from 400 to 700 nanometers must be preserved to maintain vision under all conditions of illumination. Increasing the number or width of fixed attenuation bands in the visible spectrum will result in unacceptable degradation of the transmittance of visible light through the protective material. New concepts are therefore required. The effort sought in this solicitation is for new technological approaches to protect the eyes of combat vehicle crews, when using unity vision equipment, against emerging multi-wavelength and frequency-agile lasers. The basic desired attributes of a broadband filter usable in unity vision equipment include: capable of being integrated into a unity vision device such that the resulting integrated system has good optical properties, useful durability and ruggedness characteristics, and minimal increase in the unity vision device's bulk and weight, capable of meeting minimum optical density requirements regardless of the angle of incidence of the laser radiation; capable of not interfering with normal color vision and stereo vision; response time for activation of attenuation of less than one (1) nanosecond; recovery time from attenuating condition of less than 0.1 second; visual transmittance-both photopic and scotopic-of at least 50%; capable of functioning without sources of power or input energy other than the incoming radiation; capable of operating without concentration of energy at a focal plane; capable of functioning in temperature extremes (0 degrees to 50 degrees C) and humidity extremes (0% to 100%), resistant to abrasion, salt spray, chemicals, and laser damage; and capable of fabrication in area of at least 100 square centimeters. Phase I: The contractor shall investigate, design, and provide a proof-of principle demonstration of a broadband laser filter suitable for use in unity vision devices and meeting the requirements set forth in the project description. Phase II: The contractor shall fabricate and demonstrate the protection approach developed in Phase I. An initial demonstration utilizing the protection approach only may be done, but a final demonstration shall be conducted with the protection approach integrated into the unity vision devices. Requirement: This project is essential for the future development of broadband filters for use in unity vision devices. The lack of a focal plane in current unity vision equipment forces the use of unique and novel approaches in order to meet the developmental and operational requirements. Potential Commercial Market: The approach developed under this project has potential applications for safety and health equipment needed for ocular welding systems and for optical switching components in communication and computing systems. OSCR: This project has the potential to reduce optical equipment replacement costs due to the use of a broadband laser filter in such equipment as opposed to filters offering only discrete wavelength protection.

Manufacturing techniques for these composite materials are not yet fully matured. Further, once in use in a vehicle, the soundness of the composite structure cannot always be determined visually as damage within the composite material is not always evident on the surface of the material. Such damage generally requires highly trained technicians and special equipment to determine the structural soundness of the composite material. A single system to monitor the fabrication and structural integrity of the composite system must be developed. This single system would be sewn into the fabric preform (fibers), monitor the wetting (or mold fill) of the fibers by the resin (matrix), monitor the cure of the composite part, and provide continuous structural integrity monitoring for the life of the composite part or vehicle. Phase I: The contractor will conduct a technology assessment of in-situ multifunctional monitoring systems, and expand/develop systems for use in composite vehicle structures. The government will evaluate the research and concepts to determine the potential for use in composite structures. A final report will detail the Phase I effort. Phase II: The contractor will continue to develop the monitoring systems, fabricate a thick section composite panel with the embedded monitoring system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design. Potential Commercial Market: In-situ multifunctional monitoring systems support both military and civilian needs. The Composite Armored Vehicle and potential follow-on production of military vehicles with composite structures require structural integrity monitoring systems. Aircraft (Army, Air Force and Navy) make extensive use of composite materials in wings and other primary and secondary structures. Currently they require extensive laboratory nondestructive evaluation to determine structural integrity, and have no means to determine proper cure of composite parts.

Technology areas addressing these targets as well as that of reducing engine weight include: (1) high temperature tribology (Tribological system approaches should address high temperature lubricant capability, and friction and wear minimization in areas of borderline lubrication); (2) insulative componentry (Components to be considered shall include pistons, rings, liners, valves, valve guides and seats, head or head combustion face and intake and exhaust ports. Novel monolithic and coating applications for these components will be considered); (3) fuel injection system/combustion enhancement (Technologies to be considered include ultra-high pressure injection or other combustion technologies enabling diesel combustion toward stoichiometric conditions without fuel economy degradation); (4) high efficiency broad range turbomachinery (Military diesels require compact, high efficiency, broad range, low inertia and tolerance to high exhaust pressure.

Potential Commercial Market: Although commercial diesel engines ae generally operated at lower brake mean effective pressures (BMEP) than their military counterparts, the trend for commercial engines is now directed toward higher BMEPs for improved fuel economy and emissions reasons. THis trend has been observed in teh ""Advanced Diesel Engine Program"" being sponsored by teh Department of Energy. These advanced commercial diesel engines will require high temperature insulative and tribological componentry because of the higher operating temperatures encountered with the increasing BMEP levels. Insulating in-cylinder components and exhaust ports will provide an increase in exhaust energy which is beneficial when used in conjuction with exhaust energy recovery (turbocompond) devices. Turbocompound devices are an integral part of the design concept for these advanced engines. Power generated from these devices is returned to the engine crankcase which is key to the efficiency gainst to be made.

It would be desirable, from an operational standpoint, to minimize the number of steps involved in performing the assay. For example, ideally, it might involve adding the unknown sample or standards to a labelled antibody, incubate the fluid and have the particulate/antibody complex remain on the filter to be read by fluorescent concentration.

Recently, advances have been made which may make it possible to field actual neural network technology for range instrumentation. Demonstration of this technology would require interfacing existing CCD sensors directly with temporal cellular neural networks and creating a CCD/neural network camera where signals can be processed by the neural network in a parallel and continuous manner. Phase I: Research will be required to study and develop the design of such a camera.

Currently, MRTD is performed in a time consuming, subjective manner, with several trained observers determining the final decision (given unlimited viewing time). Imaging infrared sensors that require this laboratory measurement are expected to thrive as a primary technology well into the 21st century. The Redstone Technical Test Center (RTTC) has determined a need for development of a new automated approach for MRTD and resolution measurements. Although some ""automated"" MRTD methods currently exist, they do not actually model the human visual cognitive process involved with trained observer decision making. The method proposed should use a video frame storage and computer to replace the video display and the trained human operator which will remove operator subjectivity from the evaluation process. After digitization, the FLIR video signal will be processed through stages modeling the display-eye interface. A neural network will then analyze the processed image to determine the degree of resolution between the four bars of the target. The candidate neural network model to be investigated should use fuzzy logic with boundary and feature contour systems. This technique should offer the possibility of standardization between laboratories and test facilities. Phase I: Complete conceptual design a development of a model for visual cognitive processing.

Improved measurements include trajectory parameters, motion about the center of mass (e.g. spin and coning) and characteristics of events (e.g. time of occurrence and duration). Recent advances in radar imaging suggest it is now possible to adapt imaging technology to obtain even more information in the test center environment. Of particular interest are measurements of attitude of missiles and aircraft, measurements of miss distances of high-altitude missile and target engagements, detection of deployed objects, and determination of extent of damage (i.e, damage/kill assessment). In general, the requirement is to make measurements at high altitudes or long ranges where optical data are not available and where current instrumentation radars are incapable of making the measurements to the desired accuracy (e.g. miss distance to +/- 1 ft) or making the measurements at all (e.g. damage assessment). Phase I: Research is required to determine the extent to which radar imaging technology is applicable to those measurements, to characterize the problems to be solved (e.g. resolution of individual scattering centers, elimination of acceleration smearing, stabilization of shifting phase centers, and identification and correction of multiple-bounce returns), and to specify the upgrades needed for the WSMR instrumentation radars and data processing facilities. Phase II: Develop a prototype processor to make the radar images and extract the desired measurements. Some human intervention may be needed in the measurement process, but the prototype system should be as autonomous as possible, particularly in the arduous task of deriving the radar image from the coherent video data.

Current animation systems lack the geographic referencing and temporal database links necessary to monitor the changing battlefield. The system should have the capability to display changes to point (ie. Military Units), line (ie. Forward Edge of Battle Area (FEBA)), and area features (ie. Area of Interest (AIO)) over time. The system should be geographically referenced and able to incorporate standard Defense Mapping Agency products for the map background. The system should also be able to extract data from a geographic information system for use in either the map background or for the changing features of the battlefield. Basic 'tweening' and 'morphing' capabilities for interpolating point, line, and area features between known positions are required. IN addition, the system should be capable of displaying environmental effects such as day/night illumination, snow, rain, fog, smoke, and other obscurants. Battlefield sounds will also be linked to the animation. Users should be able to develop custom symbols for display based on the attributes of the features in the geographic database. The system should allow flexible display of the movement of the military operations. Users should be able to control the rate of animation, move forward or backward in time, freeze the display, and zoom in on portions of the display. Users should also be able to annotate the animation using a capability similar to the 'chalkboards' on television instant replay and output the results to video tape. Phase I: The contractor shall develop the concept for a cartographic animation system and demonstrate the basic capabilities to link to a geographic information system; animate dynamic point, line, and area features, incorporate environmental effects, and sound, and output the images to video tape. Phase II: The contractor shall develop a prototype cartographic animation system. The system will have the capability to generate a new temporal database for mission planning or exploit an externally generated database for evaluating a previous operation. Full geographic referencing and use of Defense Mapping Agency products will be demonstrated, along with the capability to generate user-defined symbols. Potential Commercial Market: Phase III potential should be high.

These new tungsten-based alloys will be designed to display an early onset of dynamic plastic instability and flow localization. This may be accomplished by configuring new matrix material and modified and enhanced tungsten particles into particulate composites having appropriate characteristic microstructures and thermomechanical properties that induce the desired flow localization in the material.

Prepare material for high strain rate screening and sub-scale ballistic testing. Potential Commercial Market: The technology developed under this program will allow advancement in both military and commercial fields. Alternate material will replace the environmentally sensitive depleted uranium in all of the DOD munition application.

These include software to model equilibrium chemistry (MCVECE), reaction kinetics (PANDORA), reactive chemistry/hydrodynamics (VULCAN), droplet formation and size distribution, and molecular dynamics. Along with these modeling codes, dynamic color graphics have also been developed which give real time visual simulation of the modeling output. In addition, other codes developed elsewhere are also available that predict molecular structure, thermodynamic parameters, and model explosive processes. These codes are used individually at ARDEC to design and characterize energy parameters of new molecules; screen molecules as potential candidate propellant or explosive ingredients and their potential formulations; model propellant combustion and interior ballistic cycles; predict potential propellant and explosive performance; and, model environmental impact. Other military application of these codes include modeling processes involving munitions production, munitions demilling, and their environmental impact. An even greater number of applications are possible in the commercial sector. Although these computer codes are available, utilizing them in an efficient integrated interactive way is currently not possible without specific detailed knowledge of the individual codes. That is to say that data, parameter and variable compatibility between programs and simulation tasks must be established and maintained. Specifically, what is needed is a program which: 1) automatically examines simulation task requirements against the available modules and their respective functions and input requirements; and, 2) after this examination interrogates the user to supply input that may be lacking or needs modification. To develop a new propellant, it would be possible to design a candidate propellant oxidizer, predict its thermodynamic parameters, optimize a propellant formulation with a given fuel, simulate its interior ballistic cycle and predict its performance automatically by imputing an educated guess of its molecular structure into a properly structured MOPIT. In a similar fashion, a newly proposed propulsion concept could be modeled so that a rapid economic evaluation of its merit could be made. Phase I: Develop an initial MOPIT infrastructure. Demonstrate the feasibility of the MOPIT concept utilizing only a few selected programs as a preliminary program library. Perform preliminary MOPIT modeling and simulation investigation of two tasks. Model same tasks with individual unlinked programs and provide analysis which compares the MOPIT results with the results from the individual unlinked programs. Phase II: Expand the initial MOPIT developed in Phase I by accumulating and evaluating an extensive library of programs to be used in MOPIT. Standardize name convention and units for all variables and constants in the candidate modular programs. Structure MOPIT to be language independent so that it can accept and interact with new programs written in different languages and automatically perform desired modeling. Provide MOPIT software capable of modeling a broad spectrum of tasks which address propulsion related phenomena complete with source code and documentation. Potential Commercial Market: The software developed under this program can be utilized for any physico-chemical process and therefore has many military, commercial and academic applications. For example the designing and manufacture of exotic materials such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals could be modeled with this MOPIT. For environmental impact studies the chemistry and physics of processes can be modeled and the evolution and spatial/time path of pollutants c an be tracked.

Usually, a feedstock of metal or ceramic powders blended with molten polymer binders is injected into dies in a manner identical to polymer injection molding. The formed parts in the as-injected molded condition are called ""green"". After molding, the polymer binder is no longer needed and is usually removed from the formed part by a combination of solvent and thermal debinding; the remaining metal or ceramic powder, brown part, retains the formed shape. These debound parts are then centered in the usual way. Powder injection molding is a process that is capable of producing complex metal and ceramic components at a great cost savings. If the process is to become fully successful then the parts produced must be made with a reasonable degree of confidence in the finished part. That is with a low rate of internal defects and a high level of quality. It must also be produced in a manner that is benign with respect to the environment. Proposals are sought that address the technical problems of powder injection from any of a number of possible avenues. In no particular order, these may include, but are not limited to: (a) NDT of green (as-molded) components, (b) environmentally compatible binders and debinding agents, (c) injection molding od difficult to machine materials, (d) Modeling of the molding process particularly as it relates to final part quality, or (e) any aspect of the process seen as needing investigation. Phase I: Identify and develop advanced methods for the production of high quality powder injection molded components. Demonstrate the appropriateness of the methods for the applications. Deliver demonstration components produced with the techniques, methods or procedures developed. All Phase I work should concentrate on one or two types of material, e.g., stainless steel, tungsten alloy, intermetallic, composite, ceramic, etc. so as to concentrate on developing the innovation. Phase II: Work in Phase II should exploit the Phase I success, expand the range of materials and begin to apply the methods developed to production-like situations. This work should highlight the generic nature of the developed material, process or method and deliver prototype or demonstration components. The work in powder injection is inherently dual-use and demonstration components should reveal this aspect of the process.

Results suggest enhanced penetration resistance with a fine grain Al MMC produced by thermomechanical processing over monolithically produced counterparts. Agglomeration of reinforcement along flow lines from deformation processing can be detrimental to spallation. A combination of whisker and particulate reinforcement i n forming a hybrid MMC may alleviate this predicament. Processing such Al MMCs via current powder metallurgy or rapid solidification techniques is relatively expensive, and heat extraction may be an obstacle when using these methods to produce thick sections (> 2 inches). Though low cost wrought and cast Al MMCs are available; their strength, ductility, and toughness are either lower or only comparable to their respective monolithic counterparts. The focus of this topic is to exploit innovative low cost thick section processing capabilities for the fabrication of Al MMCs with the proper microstructure for structural armor applications. The ability to tailor the composite for reinforcement loading and control of the matrix grain size is crucial. Furthermore, the process is required to maintain homogeneous and uniform reinforcement distribution and a fine grain matrix microstructure throughout the thickness up to, but not limited to, 2 inches.

Emphasize existing FGM technology that has a commercial basis on which to solidify a strong dual-use capability.","STATEMENT OF PROBLEM - The Armor Mechanics Branch has a number of separate 6.2 research programs funded under the ARL's AH80 Armor Technology Techbase program as well as under TACOM's DC05 Passive Armor Technology Program. Two programs of interest have been the development of low-cost titanium alloys for ballistic application and the evaluation of high performance ballistic ceramics. These programs have also been supplemented through various unfunded study agreements with Industry that provide the material support and development. Recently, the amalgamation of these two technologies into functionally gradient materials has been noted by at least two commercial firms that have strong armor materials background. Functionally gradient materials are in homogeneous composites which transition from ceramic to metal in well defined graded layers. While extensive research has been noted in this area worldwide, armor-related research has been limited. The primary application for armor technology is to solve the inherent difficulties of attaching ceramic/metal composites to armored vehicles without losing the high ballistic performance of armor ceramic composites or gaining large parasitic attachment mass which lowers relative system performance. Functionally gradient materials offer solutions for these problems as well as providing a composite material which has strong commercial potential. This topic area would allow the demonstration of this technology for use in near-term applique applications for upgrading the ballistic performance of the existing armored vehicle fleet. Phase I: 1. Review the existing ceramic database and develop a matrix of ballistic ceramics which could be combined with titanium to form gradient materials. 2. Develop procedures or models to analyze the various material parameters that affect fabrication of functionally gradient materials such as thermal expansion, melting points and relationship to densification temperatures, elastic modules and other inherent material properties. 3. Select one or more representative ceramic/titanium composites and demonstrate the feasibility of the FGM by fabricating samples at least 100mm square or in diameter. 4. Propose the procedures for scaling FGM's to 150mm square tiles as well as further optimizing the FGM which would be used for Phase II ballistic testing. 5. Demonstrate the ability to mechanically attach the FGM to a metallic base armor. Phase II: 1. Fabricate 150mm X 150mm tiles in various thicknesses to determine the baseline ballistic performance in standardized depth of penetration tests. 2. Optimize the ballistic performance by varying the interface compositions and thicknesses and fabricate improved ballistic tiles for testing. 3. Fabricate a large 450mm X 450mm array that can be mechanically attached to a base armor to demonstrate the multihit ballistic performance in a standardized ballistic test as well as the ability to adapt the design mechanically to a base armor. Potential Commercial Market: The current commercial applications of functionally gradient materials of ceramic-titanium are large because the inherent metal base of the material is retained simplifying the mechanical/fabrication aspects of an application but allowing the high performance use of the ceramic facing. The materials have inherent high strength and net shape forming is also possible which reduces fabrication costs.

Furthermore, the ability to conduct early tests would allow many more iterations of a design to be conducted, thus improving reliability and allowing early incorporation/evaluation of maintainability features. The 3-D solid models available using stereolithography, currently the most popular rapid prototype method, have very poor strength, ductility, surface finish and dimensional stability over time. An advanced process or technique which significantly improves these deficiencies and provides high temperature (150-250 degrees F), strength and ductility is desired. Fabrication of the model from ceramic cast metals, powdered metals, high-strength engineering plastics would potentially improve some of these limitations. Processes which rapidly produce models using additive processes or advanced casting methods will be considered. It is desired that these models (scaled or full scale) be suitable for airflow, vibration, and potentially heat transfer and limited structural testing. For example, scale models of compressor rotors, gearbox housings and structural mounts for electronic sensors can currently be produced in less than ten hours using stereolithography. Due to the limitations of the model material and the relative accuracy versus the actual part, the model is unsuitable for testing. The ability to go from a solid model to a prototype, testable model in 3 to 5 days is desired. Phase I: Develop a design for a rapid prototyping system capable of producing solid models suitable for limited functional testing.

The system should produce models with strength, dimensional accuracy, and thermal stability significantly above those currently available utilizing stereolithography.

Results of this testing will be used to evaluate the concepts potential for successful development.

The problems associated with sand and rain impingement on blade leading edges and surfaces have resulted in severe damage and the resultant expenditures to replace, repair and maintain blades have been significant. The severity of the sand erosion problem was recently demonstrated in the Middle East during the Desert Shield/Desert Storm conflict. An optimum erosion system for a rotor blade requires a design that is effective in both rain and sand environments. Testing performed to date shows that metallic (hard) erosion systems perform best in rain, and nonmetallic (soft/pliable) materials perform best in sand. An acceptable protective design compromise capable of extended performance in both sand and rain has yet to be fielded. In view that work directed toward solving this problem has been ongoing since early 1960 it appears that a new design approach, directed to achieve an optimum system, is warranted. The elastomer (urethane, estane, etc.) stripping or boot applied to the rotor blade leading edge for sand protection lends itself, by its inherent physical characteristics, to modifications that will provide total erosion (sand and rain) protection. Metallic erosion protection systems, on the other hand, can only be enhanced by increased hardness and therefore do little to combat sand erosion. This proposed effort will investigate the potential of enhanced rain erosion protection of elastomer matrices, already proven to have good sand erosion characteristics, by introducing fabric, fiber or mesh laminations to reinforce the elastomer and distribute the loads and deformations associated with rain impingement. Phase I: The work to be conducted during this phase would use the analytical developments available from recent studies concerning the theories and mechanics of erosion on helicopter rotor blades and other aircraft systems to design and evaluate the integration of fiber and fabric reinforcement into elastomers already proven to have good sand erosion resistance. Reinforcement materials to be included in this study would include composites of varying denier, weave an d stiffness. Positioning (depth) of the reinforcement laminate within the elastomer, physical characteristics (durometer, thickness, etc.) of the elastomer on either side of the reinforcement laminate, and the use of multiple layers of reinforcement and elastomer will be addressed. A briefing describing the work conducted in this phase and recommendations regarding material concept designs which should receive additional consideration (fabrication and test) will be provided. Upon Government approval test coupons representative of these designs will be fabricated and subjected to rain erosion tests. Results will be compared to previous work and ongoing tests conducted at the Wright Laboratory Rain Erosion Test Facility at Wright-Patterson AFB. Phase II: Upon successful completion of the Phase I testing additional test specimens will be tested in a designated sand erosion test facility to assure that the addition of the reinforcement material has not sacrificed the original sand erosion resistance. Upon successful completion of the sand erosion tests, a manufacturing process development task will be undertaken to define possible full-scale fabrication techniques of the erosion resistant material concept.

Some attempts have been made to equip composite molds with acoustic, pressure, or temperature transducers, but these designs rely on extrapolation of surface condition data to estimate the rheological condition of the entire laminate. Sensors that are embedded into the laminates in critical areas, such as in thick areas and joints, that do not adversely affect the quality of the laminate will provide more accurate status for active or intelligent cure monitoring and control systems. Additionally, sensors that remain in the cured laminate may be valuable to assess the quality or integrity of the laminate for inspection purposes in production and in the field. Sensor development for directly measuring Tg, % cure, viscosity, etc., rather than using related parameters is desired. Development of in-situ sensors will support S&T Thrust #7 Technology for Affordability, and Structural Integrity Program objectives. Phase I: Using the chosen sensor concept, define and quantify the appropriate thermoset, thermoplastic, or other polymer resin rheological parameters that are necessary to determine the exact state of cure of that system during processing and cure. Test and characterize the candidate sensor designs' sensitivity and accuracy in measuring the identified critical parameters. A final technical briefing summarizing the results and conclusions of the contract work will be presented to the Government at the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, Fort Eustis, Virginia. Phase II: Fabricate and test prototype sensors in-situ in composite laminates during optimum and anomalous cure cycles. Material characterization of the correctly cured laminates will be used to calibrate the sensors' performance. Interrupted, terminated, or otherwise anomalous cure cycles will be completed to demonstrate the sensors' ability to accurately diagnose the cure state of the laminate and monitor the remaining processing to achieve adequate structural integrity. Additionally, where appropriate, demonstrate the sensors' utility as an inspection (quality control) device or health (strain, damage) monitor.

The eyes of the soldier, and the many sensors essential to the combat effectiveness of our fighting forces concentrate the energy from these low-energy devices. The resulting high concentration of laser energy is capable of damaging the retina or the sensor. Protective devices thus far developed, utilizing fixed filters of some type, provide a useful but limited level of protection against one, two or three laser wavelengths, usually with a significant loss of vision caused by reduction in the overall level of light transmitted. Phase I: Investigate new materials and structures that interrupt or attenuate low-energy laser beams from devices operating at one or more wavelengths, reducing the residual energy to a level that causes negligible damage to the retina or sensor. Structures that have shown some promise in the past include rugate filters and non-planar holographic structures for several fixed wavelengths, as well as nonlinear optical materials and lens arrays for tunable lasers. Each of these has shortcomings. In the first phase of the proposed SBIR, a specific approach to laser eye protection is to be developed, and a demonstration device incorporating the approach is to be built. The device should have a visual transmittance of at least 50% in its normal or unactivated state. An effective optical density of 4 throughout the designated spectral region should be attained within 30 nanoseconds of the initiation of the laser pulse. Phase II: The concepts developed in Phase I should be incorporated into a complete system of headborne eye wear providing the specified level of laser protection. The device should be as lightweight and compact as is feasible, and should exhibit maximum durability with available materials. Potential Commercial Market: Lasers, and devices using them, are becoming commonplace in several commercial applications. For example, the use of lasers in surgical procedures calls for protection against the laser wavelength with maximum transmission of all other visible light. In laboratories where several types of lasers are in use, efficient blocking of multiple wavelengths may be required. In this case, the requirement for a high level of light transmission is even more difficult to meet.

Research and development efforts are ongoing to develop lightweight materials systems that provide a high level of ballistic protection against multiple ballistic threats. Flexibility is typically inherent in the materials used to protect the individual soldier from fragmentation-type threats. A configuration has also been developed and demonstrated that allows for a flexible application of the rigid-composite materials required to defeat flechettes. The ceramic- and metal-based composites currently used to protect against small arms threats (.30 caliber) present technical barriers (e.g., physical structure, thickness, failure mechanisms) that inhibit their application in a flexible manner. Significant advancements are necessary to accomplish the development of a flexible system that maintains acceptable performance against small arms threats without adversely impacting the overall weight of a system. Potentially, there are at least two approaches to addressing this problem: 1) the development of a new lightweight material system that is inherently flexible, or 2) the development of a method or technique to apply current or emerging rigid materials in a flexible configuration without compromising performance or weight. The first approach is considered to be the most technically challenging since data to date supports the need for a rigid materials to defeat these kinetic energy rounds.

To accomplish this objective, innovative new approaches to materials development will be required. One possible approach is to adapt superlattice concepts already utilized in semiconductor microelectronics to the field of thermoelectrics. The approach affords the potential for bandgap engineering and delta doping of thermoelectric superlattice structures to vastly improve on electronic carrier mobilities. At the same time the superlattice structure should degrade the lattice thermal conductivity of the material system by increasing phonon scattering from the added interfaces and differing atomic masses. This combination of higher electronic and lower thermal conductivities directly translates into potentially large gains in the overall thermoelectric performance. Such an effort would lead to the development of new materials with large potential ZT enhancements. This would provide efficient thermoelectric coolers to temperatures below 100K for cryogenic sensor and electronic applications, and would permit the direct substitution of all current CFC-based air conditioning and refrigeration technologies by thermoelectric cooler systems with plug compatible efficiencies.

These include x-ray, infrared, ultrasonic, and 3-D x-ray. Often, there is a trade-off between equipment sensitivity and reliability of finding defects: higher sensitivities find more defects but cause more false alarms. A system architecture and algorithmic approach is required for fusing image data from multiple inspection methods in essence to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. This should increase the probability of finding defects, reduce the incidence of false alarms, and possibly allow discrimination between various defect types. Real-time image processing, neural networks, fuzzy logic, and rule-based systems, or a combination of these, should be considered. Phase I: Requires concept exploration, review of current literature, feasibility study, and development of proposed system architecture/algorithms. Development of a System Concept Document (SCD), which must include a consideration of necessary hardware, multi-system inspection data fusion techniques, programming strategy, and applicable statistical analysis. Phase II: Phase II would consist of preparation of detailed design drawings, collection of data from proposed individual inspection systems, development of pseudocode to implement algorithms, and assembly of a prototype system. Prototype design will be verified by inspecting example electronic assemblies.

The adaptive window size allows the wavelet transform to zoom on discontinuities, edges and other types of cue features where an optimal combination of local amplitude and phase information is essential for a high fidelity temporal and spatial representation. The constant Q property of wavelet band pass filters leads to a sampling in the scale dimension which is exponential and can be implemented with fast algorithms.

A simplified technique is required to make these tradeoffs without completing a full parametric evaluation with large signature models for all environmental conditions.,"The visual thru thermal bands, .4-14 microns, is a large span of wavelengths to balance signature management materials spectral reflectance to match a specific background. Surfaces can be described in terms of diffuse and specular reflectance. When materials applied to ground vehicle systems in the open environment, specular reflections play an important role in the overall signature of the vehicle. By tailoring the materials applied the surface may be more or less specular. The bi-directional reflectance is also an important quantity to accurately represent a surface. The reason is that the sky is not uniformally luminated. So at various angles to which a vehicle is viewed the energy received at the eye/sensor is a combination of the integrated sky convolved for each vehicle facet, for each sky angle. In some cases an additional term of the foreground must be included in the calculations. Phase I: Develop a technique to model narrow band spectral and bi-directional reflectance.

IMATRON builds an x-ray tube whose target is a large arc supporting medical tomography. This solicitation is for the development of a family of x-ray tubes in which the target would be a long straight line and scanned in linear fashion, similar to the IMATRON tube. The family should include tubes that have electron targets of various lengths, ranging from about ten centimeters to one meter or more. The scanning of the target, beam current and accelerating voltage of the tubes must be electronically controllable from a microcomputer. Scanning rates should be greater than sixty scans per second. The range of accelerating voltage should be from 20 KeV to 180 KeV and higher. Tube currents within the family should range from one milliampere to several hundred milliampere . The effective spot size of the x-ray beam must be as small as possible and always less than two millimeters and preferably comparable to that of microfocus tubes. Some of the tubes must be designed such that the x-rays will be emitted perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the plane of the electron beam.

This manual operation requires significant operator skill to accomplish in an accurate and timely manner, and requires additional verification to preclude accidentally firing on friendly units. As the Army moves to an increasingly digitized battlefield, this present manual artillery fire control sight will be the limiting element in the requirement to conduct responsive, effective, and safe fire support. T he essential characteristics of the fire control sight to meet this requirement are: a) Configuration as a retrofit item so that it can be applied to existing towed and self-propelled howitzers with minimal or no modification to the existing weapon. It could also be used as a part of some future artillery fire control systems. b) The ability to automatically level the optical element of the sight by replacing the manual levelling using bubble vials of the present sight mount. c) The optical element (panoramic telescope) should be rugged and light weight, constructed of state-of-the-art optical technology. It should also function as the direct fire sight for targets out to ranges of 2000 meters. d) The sight should have a directional reference which will determine the orientation of the gun tube with respect to a grid north reference when the gun is initially layed upon occupation of the firing position. The required accuracy is one artillery m il with a required time to orient of 180 sec and a desired time of 120 sec. This directional reference will also function as the reference for subsequent traverse of the gun tube. The reference may be integral with the sight or a separate unit mounted elsewhere on the weapon with an electrical/electronic interface to the sight. The optical element is also to be referenced to this directional reference. e) The sight should have an electronic horizontal reference integral to the sight. This reference would function as the reference to elevate the gun, to level the optical element, and to position the optical element for direct fire. f) The sight should electronically accept fire commands in digital format either in standard RS-422 computer format or in the present gun display unit format. g) The sight should output to a suitable display for the gunner, the direction and the amount to elevate or depress the gun and to traverse the gun so that the gun is pointed in accordance with the given fire commands. The optical element should also move in such a manner that the reference direction is maintained. The sight should output a digital signal which confirms tot eh source of the fire commands that the gun has been correctly positioned in elevation and traverse. h) The sight should provide for one man, one sight aiming of the howitzer. An auxiliary display for elevation only may be required for the assistant gunner to allow for two man operation on some weapons. Phase I: Develop a conceptual design for the digital sight including appropriate trade-off analysis to define the significant features and the specifications for the components. Do an error analysis to determine the required accuracy of the azimuth and elevation references and any other components which impact the overall performance of the sight. Develop a preliminary design for the optical element. Complete a preliminary functional specification and a plan of r development of four prototype units in Phase II. Phase II: Develop four prototype digital sights for engineering test and field evaluation. Initial testing will consist of engineering tests in the laboratory and in the field to validate the design concepts and to verify the sight's operability during live firing. Subsequent testing will extend to a firing platoon (four guns) and will expose the digital sight to a user field evaluation. Based on the analysis of data from the tests and the demonstrated accuracy and functional characteristics, develop a finalized functional specification for the digital sight. Potential Commercial Market: The technology developed under this program would have broad application int he ares of civil engineering, environmental and other disciplines where accurate orientation of a device with respect to external references is required. Any robotic device which must accurately position itself to perform a task while maintaining a relationship to a directional or horizontal reference would be a specific application of this technology. The commercial market potential for this technology, packaged in a different form, is extensive and would definitely support follow-on development. OSCR: This digital sight would increase the responsiveness and accuracy, and improve the safety of existing U.S. Army howitzer weapons, both self-propelled and towed. All weapons, except those of the M109 family, converted to Paladin configuration would benefit from its development and production. It would be possible to retrofit existing weapons with minimum cost. The digital sight wold be compatible with the existing TACFIRE system and the future AFATDS and digital battlefield without modification. The system would be lighter and easier to manufacture than present optical sights and mounts and would include inherent alignment verification and backup capability lacking in other all electronic howitzer fire control systems.",865,5528,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62219/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62219/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:35:55,,,,,A94-027_62219,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C2_A94-027,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:47.369826+00

This information might then be used to reduce the time required in re-testing the component when reused. Like hardware, reusable software components are seen as a way of increasing software reliability. Reusable hardware components allow one to quickly replace faulty hardware. This has greatly increased the reliability and reduces the down-time of hardware systems. It is hoped that software reuse can result in similar improvements for software systems. Object-oriented languages and libraries of mathematical and scientific procedures are outgrowths of this desire to reliably reuse software. When a software component form one application can be reused reliably in another application, software development time is decreased and programmer productivity is increased. A proposed approach is to develop a technique to verify the software component by collecting information on the data states during its initial testing. By collecting this information, along with the output produced by that data state, one is able to stop the testing whenever a data state created is identical to one already collected during the initial testing. This is possible because for this test case we already know the outcome. This technique will help to reduce the development time and costs when using reusable software components. Phase I: This phase would study various methods to efficiently capture, store, and retrieve the internal data state information to reduce the time required in re-testing the component. Measures, such as testability, would be applied to determine where, and how to best apply the techniques to software components. A final technical report would document the work and suggest appropriate implementation strategies. Phase II: Phase II would design, prototype, and demonstrate the tool on actual Ada software components. Phase III: This phase would validate and commercialize the prototype by experimenting on actual Ada software components in a repository and their reuse in practice. The contractor would provide evidence of the advantages of using this technique. Deliverables would minimally include the software and documentation, and final technical reports summarizing all experimental evidence collected, research findings, and an overall evaluation of this technique in terms of applicability to real world reuse activities. Potential Commercial Market: Dual use potential is excellent. Private sector firms that are using Ada have the same need to reduce the cost of testing software. Potentially, 100% of the technology developed in this research will be pertinent to non-government agencies.

The purpose is to enhance the current design process and to facilitate novel design of printed antennas embedded in the complex environment uniquely found in the Army battlefield environment.Develop and demonstrate concepts for improving overall system sensitivities of Army ELINT and ESM systems.,"Studies continue to show that, the radiating system of portable Army electronic systems become a dominant factor in the attainment of compact, reliable systems with optional power performance. As power requirements for digital processing electronics continues to dramatically decline, analog RF components and systems become the major user of primary battery power. Because of fundamental limitations, as expressed in the ""Friis"" equation, gain related to the efficient and perhaps self-adapting antenna system remains an area where system improvement can be achieved. This gain improvement impacts battery weight requirements with almost a linear factor for modern communications systems (e.g. doubling the antenna system gain will reduce the battery weight by almost a factor of two). Printed antenna are light weight, small in size, inexpensive to produce, conformal to complex surfaces and highly efficient. Despite the fact that they are easy to produce, progression realizing the full potential has been slow due to difficulties in modifying or tuning designs once they have been fabricated. Without adequate analysis / diagnostic tools, antenna designers simply cannot afford to apply these antennas in complex environments, nor can they afford to explore novel concepts. The concept of a comprehensive array design system for printed circuit antennas and arrays, including the feed network must be developed. To provide an all-encompassing design environment, the design system must have the capability to perform array synthesis, to simulate aperture as well as patch antennas in a multi-layered configuration, to design feed networks, to analyze layouts and to perform sensitivity analysis of the resulting radiating system. All of these capabilities must be integrated seamlessly int o a common design framework. To develop a comprehensive array design system involves not only the development of new simulation programs, but also a user friendly graphical interface. Most rigorous numerical programs for antennas are non-trivial because to use they require not only specifying the boundary of the geometer but also discretizing the array structure geometer into cells as well. This is especially true for sensitivity analysis where small dimensional modifications are often involved. Without a convenient, interactive interface to perform the tasks, the practical usefulness of a design is limited. A state of the art interface can provide built-in knowledge and design automation. Phase I: To develop a graphical user interface for specifying printed antennas and arrays in a multi-layer environment. The interface must include circuit elements found in the feed network and the range of transmission media employed in the feed network a s well as the radiating element. Phase II: Expand the user interface and electromagnetic simulator tools to include applications specific Green's function module and to provide capability to link the module with the simulation engine. Potential Commercial Market: The technology obtained will have application to a wide variety of portable electronic systems. Antenna system efficiency and array processing will play a key role in reducing power requirements, hence, reduction of battery requirements. This effort will have direct application to the entire range of ""wireless"" systems now under evaluation and to systems operating on the ""Information Highway.""

The horizontally and vertically polarized components of the signal can be processed with a resultant improvement in SSL accuracy. Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Directorate (IEWD) has already designed and built polarization diversity combiners for the CART antenna. During FY93, IEWD built and successfully demonstrated a broadband interference canceler using this antenna. Interference cancellation is achieved by steering the antenna pattern's null at the interferer. The ability to generate multiple nulls is being developed. The work proposed will leverage this technology to provide system solutions to Army HF communications and geo-location problems. A compact HF antenna array (the ""CART"" antenna) has been developed for IEWD by Flam and Russell, Inc., Horsham, PA. This antenna and/or ruggedized model of this antenna will be used in the course of this work. Phase I: A theoretical analysis of the degree of separability of the O and E rays by the CART antenna will be performed. The ability of the CART antenna to measure arrival angles with sufficient accuracy to permit inverse ray tracing will be evaluated. Accuracy improvements will be assessed and compared with present system accuracies. Candidate separation techniques will be identified and simulated. They will be verified in non-real-time using signal data collected from cooperative and non-cooperative emitters. Phase II: If Phase I is successful, the follow-on work will concentrate on the design and development of a high speed RF processor. Initial test and evaluation of the processor will be performed at IEWD facilities located at Vint Hill Farms.

Concepts developed must include process for range and intensity at every pixel of the two dimensional array.,"Military tactical and strategic target recognition from air and ground based weapon platforms are currently based on two-dimensional passive, image information. This information is not robust; it is constantly varying depending upon solar a nd weather conditions. Laser radar is a viable solution to providing robust/non-varying information to target recognition processes with the addition of a powerful third-dimension variable, range. Yet, present laser radar technologies utilizes scanners to sweep a single beam across the scene to be imaged which leads to complex, expensive, limited resolution and slow imaging systems. The new and innovative use of focal plane array (FPA) technology for staring laser radar resolves the aforementioned scanner limitations. Integrated FPA with parallel channel range and intensity processing, readout and digitization of each pixel is planned for the receiver. The transmitter will leverage laser technology advances and will be a high efficiency diode-pumped solid state device. This staring laser radar will truly be a solid state imager. The advantages of this all solid state laser radar are: reduced complexity and lower sensor production costs, resistance to shock and vibration (no moving parts), higher quality imagery (no scan artifacts and intra-frame relative pixel motion), angular resolution and scene coverage decoupled from laser pulse repetition frequency limitations (no lag angle), and the high frame rate capability. This technology is applicable to military robotic navigation and obstacle avoidance. Phase I: Investigate new and innovative designs for FPA.

This technology is intended to be used to apply, pattern, and remove stencil masks suitable for etching features with dimensions on the order of several tens of microns in epitaxial semiconductor layers without removing the wafers from a high-vacuum processing environment.","In its most generic form, the conventional procedure for fabricating advanced opto-electronic devices in semiconductor wafers involves deposition of layers, patterning of layers, and removal of layers. Layer materials can be semiconductors, metals, feroelectrics, or oxides. For deposition, some form of evaporation is used; for removal, some form of plasma etching is used. For both of the processes, a wafer is held in a vacuum system. To delineate areas for etching, a sacrificial stencil mask is temporarily fabricated on the surface of a layer. An organic photo resist is the current material of choice for this mask. Resist is a liquid which is applied as droplets, patterned with ultraviolet radiation, and removed with organic solvents. Because resist technology is a ""wet"" process, a wafer must be removed from the vacuum system. As the complexity of devices increases and the range of materials is extended to include such delicate materials as mercury cadmium telluride and high-temperature superconductors, the push to abandon conventional wet lithography increases. The rationale for doing so is that the surfaces of these materials are damaged upon exposure to air or wet chemicals, and performance of devices is degraded. An alternative to conventional processing is closed system processing. This refers to a concept whereby all device fabrication steps are carried out without removing a wafer from the protective environment of a high vacuum system. Several embodiments of this concept now exist in government and industrial laboratories. Typically, they are a collection of individual vacuum modules connected by a high vacuum wafer-transfer mechanism. Molecular beam epitaxy deposition modules and plasma etching modules are particularly compatible with such an arrangement. Since layer deposition and etching are already vacuum processes, the only barrier to a full exploitation of the closed-system concept is the lack of a technique for mask fabrication in vacuum. What is needed is a dry lithography technology - processes and equipment for applying, patterning, and removing a contact mask, all of which are compatible with a high-vacuum environment. Phase I: Demonstrate feasibility of a resist technology that is compatible with high-vacuum processing environments. On a semiconductor wafer held in a vacuum system, deposit a mask, transfer a pattern to the mask, open holes in the mask, and remove the mask. Phase II: Demonstrate that the technology can be used in a closed-system semiconductor processing environment by integrating the process developed in Phase I with the Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) microfactory located in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. This microfactory consists of five vacuum chambers and an interconnecting wafer-transfer module. Epitaxial layers of silicon, gallium arsenide, and mercury cadmium telluride are deposited and plasma etched in these chambers. In concert with NVESD scientists, utilize the microfactory and the dry lithography process to fabricate an array of mesas on various layers of these materials. Potential Commercial Market: Diode lasers and high-electron- mobility transistors are now produced in gallium arsenide by molecular beam epitaxy and wet-chemical processing. It is anticipated that infrared imaging devices will soon be produced by mbe of mercury cadmium telluride and identifical wet-chemical processing. When low-dimensional structures emerge from research laboratories and enter a development phase, similar processing will be used. The manufacturing yield for these and other commercial semiconductor products would be significantly increased if a dry lithography process were to be made available.",549,3709,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62226/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62226/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:35:59,,,,,A94-038_62226,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C2_A94-038,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:47.369826+00

This ""true"" location of a target is called the ground truth for that target. However, this rather simple comparison is, in reality, very complex. One of the reasons for its complexity is the labor intensive nature of the task. this leads to errors in t he calculation of the performance probabilities. One of the methods for eliminating errors is to extensively use automation in the generation of ground truth files. The use of Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) data has been suggested as one of the promising methods of automation. The goal of ground truth automation is the creation of files with sufficient resolution of x, y, and height so that the location of a target at those coordinates can be projected to the image plane of a sensor for automated scoring . The system must work with both stationary and slowly moving ground targets (less than 20kph). Previous experience with use of commercial GPS equipment has shown that the standard configuration does not have sufficient resolution to support automated ground truthing. There are schemes for improving the resolution of GPS output. Analysis has shown that, in earth coordinates, target location must be resolved to 2 meters (x,y, and z) to be sufficient for automation. This task requires the development and demonstration of a stand-alone system that is capable of meeting the requirements for ground truth automation. Phase I: Identify GPS equipment and data and information processing procedures adequate for producing output products of sufficient resolution to solve problem. Phase II: Develop and demonstrate stand-alone prototype ground truth system whose output can be integrated with images.

Assuming that these digital data channels exist, it is highly desirable to implement a wireless link through the dewar wall in order to: 1.) Minimize the thermal conductance to the FPA, 2.) Electrically isolate the FPA from the downstream system electronics, and 3.) Reduce the difficulty involved in replacing the dewar. In order to achieve any cooling advantage the power dissipation on the FPA per optical link must be significantly less than the heat conducted in by the wire which the optical link would replace. Also the part of the optical link resident on the FPA must have minimal thermal mass so that cool down time is not unacceptably prolonged. This part of the optical link must also operate at cryogenic temperatures. A typical data rate to be expected is 640 X 480 X 60 Hz X 12 bits/pixel, or ~200 megabits/sec.

The uncooled FPA technology is very attractive from a seeker design standpoint because it does not require high pressure coolant gas and its attendant design complications. However, to achieve the seeker sensitivity required for operation in degraded weather and battlefield obscurants, the uncooled FPA must be utilized with a very fast imaging optics (low f/no.). When this requirement is coupled with the requirements for high resolution (i.e.. long focal length), the utility of the uncooled FPA is diminished for seeker applications. This is due to the fact that very limited seeker volume is available and high resolution, low f/no. optics are expensive and bulky. To increase the utility of uncooled FPAs in imaging infrared seekers for tactical missile applications, innovative optical designs are needed. Because of look angle requirements and limitations of gimbal torque motors, the optics need to be light in weight and physically short in length. The optical resolution must be very good (equal to or less than 0.25 MR) over a relatively large field of view (equal to or greater than 10 degrees). The potential for producing the optics at low cost (i.e.. amenable to advanced production techniques) must be a consideration in the design. Performance over wide spectral bandwidths is desired by the optics can be tailored for either the MWIR or LWIR if necessary to meet design objectives. A design which maximizes detector cold shield efficiency is desirable and elimination of narcissus effects is mandatory. The optics may include reflective, refractive and binary optic elements to achieve design goals. Ultimately, the design must accommodate the inclusion of a missile dome (probably hemispherical in shape) although a dome is not necessary fort this effort. Phase I: Provide detailed analysis of at least two different conceptual designs through a preliminary design and performance prediction effort. Phase II: Develop a detailed design and fabricate hardware for demonstration and testing to verify the conceptual design feasibility.

Improved measurements include trajectory parameters, motion about the center of mass (e.g. spin and coning) and characteristics of events (e.g. time of occurrence and duration). Recent advances in radar imaging suggest it is now possible to adapt imaging technology to obtain even more information in the test center environment. Of particular interest are measurements of attitude of missiles and aircraft, measurements of miss distances of high-altitude missile and target engagements, detection of deployed objects, and determination of extent of damage (i.e, damage/kill assessment). In general, the requirement is to make measurements at high altitudes or long ranges where optical data are not available and where current instrumentation radars are incapable of making the measurements to the desired accuracy (e.g. miss distance to +/- 1 ft) or making the measurements at all (e.g. damage assessment). Phase I: Research is required to determine the extent to which radar imaging technology is applicable to those measurements, to characterize the problems to be solved (e.g. resolution of individual scattering centers, elimination of acceleration smearing, stabilization of shifting phase centers, and identification and correction of multiple-bounce returns), and to specify the upgrades needed for the WSMR instrumentation radars and data processing facilities.

The Army is currently conducting research in the area of envelope limitations and has identified a number of critical limits which generally occur in all helicopters. One needs to be able to sense the onset and then automatically avoid these limits, to protect the pilot and aircraft from loss of control, to avoid catastrophic failure, to reduce the number of minor exceedances that degrade airframe fatigue life, and to permit the pilot to safely fly the aircraft close to the edge of the envelope. A primary strength of neural networks is their ability to perform rapid pattern recognition. Given the proper training data, a neural network could be developed that rapidly identifies the onset of limit exceedances based on the pattern presented by aircraft control positions and rates and aircraft body states. Once the limit exceedance information is made available by the neural network, a feedback algorithm could be developed which takes the necessary corrective action to avoid the exceedance. Phase I: Review theory on helicopter limit exceedances and available databases. Develop a proposal to show how this information could be used to train a neural network for exceedance detection. Phase II: Develop a neural network that will perform limit exceedance prediction and train it using available test data. Install this network in a high-fidelity Army research simulator and demonstrate its ability to perform limit detection in a real-time environment.

Although this has been done in the commercial world in a few narrow applications areas, the application of this concept to software in general has not occurred. The objectives of this task are to begin to formulate standards within DoD which will encourage development of the visual programming paradigm for software in general.","Object oriented programming and software reuse are two DoD initiatives which promise to hold down the rising cost of software development and maintenance. However, neither of these two initiatives address the critical problem of sheer numbers of lines of code nor the problem of standard software interfaces. For example, even a moderately complex system such as the MLRS Improved Fire Control System is expected to contain over 150,000 line of code, and no standard software interfaces have been described for its software modules. These problems are systemic. They exist because the basic element for software definition is the ""line of code"". Such problems can be addressed in a manner similar to the methods used by engineers designing with integrated circuit s; i.e. circuit details at the transistor level are abstracted away into a functional blocks. Each functional block is represented on the schematic by a rectangle with standardized input and output pins and a defined function. These blocks are then wired together to form the data paths between blocks. Functional blocks can be combined using hierarchical design techniques to form higher level functional entities such as circuit cards or ""black boxes"". Such a methodology, if applied to software, would greatly simplify the task of designing, implementing, and maintaining software by abstracting away actual code lines into functional blocks. These blocks would have defined (standardized) inputs and outputs and could easily be maintained in a library for reuse. As a side benefit, software testing tools would be easier to develop because of the standard interfaces. By using such techniques, software productivity could be increased by at least an order of magnitude. Current software products are available which implement these concepts for narrow application areas (such as signal processing). The purpose of this SBIR topic is to extend these concepts to broader applications, to begin development of a standard tool base, and to begin developing DoD standards for the visual programming concept. Phase I: This phase would begin the primary studies required for the development of a visual language and its associated programming environment. In this phase, the contractor would make an extensive study of existing visual languages, determining their strengths and weaknesses as to application to a general programming environment. The contractor would also investigate ongoing research into visual programming languages and environments and visual language grammars. Based on these investigations, the contractor would make recommendations on such topics as execution paradigms (an example of which is data flow graphs and Petri nets, where a task is instantiated but cannot execute until all of its inputs are available), task-to-task interfaces, visual programming paradigms (for example, would directed graphs or some other method be used to describe a program?), and first-level programming primitives. As part of this phase, the contractor would also give proposals for a complete visual programming system. Phase II: The second phase of the work consists of a number of subphases, each of which builds on the preceding efforts and are successively more complex. What is ultimately desired as a programming environment in which general-purpose, real-time programs can be developed and maintained as well as a standard way in which software modules can be added to this environment. These subphases would be: 1. Development and documentation of a standard task-to-task interface whereby a software developer can construct executable tasks to run under the visual programming environment. 2. Development of a visual programming environment, in which the user can develop, debug, and execute programs by graphically linking in individually compiled tasks. As part of this environment, there would be some set of ""primitive"" general-purpose tasks from which the user could reasonably be expected to construct more complex tasks. Once an application has constructed and debugged, the environment would allow the user to produce a stand-alone executable, not requiring the development environment for its execution. 3. Development of a more extensive library of primitives and ""compound primitives,"" that is, tasks created from other primitives. This would allow the development of hierarchical programs as well as reuse library based on specific programming tasks. 4. Because it is desired that this environment be utilized for the development of real-time programs, the requirement for handling of interrupts must be addressed. The contractor will have to address such problems as what is the appropriate size for an ""atomic,"" that is, non-interruptable, operation. The contractor may also have to develop primitives for the synchronization of independent streams of execution. The contractor will have to develop graphical methods for enabling and disabling interrupts, or provide some abstraction which accounts for this. 5. Once the subject of atomic operations is addressed, the contractor will then have to investigate the timing of primitives. This will allow the user to make reasonably accurate assessments of total program execution time. It will also allow the simulation of real-time software systems in non-real-time environments. As these investigations are performed, the contractor can construct tables of execution tie versus memory versus platform for each of the primitives. These tables could then be included in the programming environment, allowing the programmer to select the size and speed of primitive to match the application. This would also allow the development of standardized, reasonable benchmarks by which different hardware/software systems could be compared. Potential Commercial Market: The potential commercial market is very large. Commercial interests face the same problems as DoD when it comes to software: specifically, high development costs and even higher maintenance costs. The end product of this effort will provide commercial user and the DoD user with a means of controlling, and even significantly reducing, these costs. Also, by its nature, this visual environment should significantly ease the effort in transporting a program from one type of execution platform to another.",948,6303,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62249/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62249/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:36:07,,,,,A94-060_62249,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C2_A94-060,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:47.369826+00

Process lends itself to continuous military user participation which will result in a high degree of user/developer agreement prior to actual building of the hardware system. The steps in the process are as follow: Step 1: Concepts - Inputs to the concepting process are based on requirements from the user community via the Battle Labs and directorates for Concept Development (DCDs), advanced technologies coming out of the ARL and industry state-of-the-art components. The process starts by developing solid models of alternative concepts such as external versus turreted weapons, tracks versus wheels, etc., to meet the requirements, from which 2D or 3D drawings (solid model) can be produced in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) station. Step 2: Performance Modeling - Analytical models can be applied to the solid model to evaluate mobility, vehicle dynamics, track & suspension, survivability, vulnerability, stealth, and lethality. Analytical results are reflected in changes to the solid model to optimize the design through an iterative process. Conflicting requirements require trade-offs which can be done in conjunction with the user. Step 3: Wargame Modeling - Resulting concept vehicles are next evaluated using wargame models. Initial concept effectiveness screening is done using GROUNDWARS. This is followed by detailed concept effectiveness screening using CASTFOREM. Step 4: Virtual Mockup/Detailed Design - The selected concept proceeds to a detailed design phase in which the solid model is refined to incorporate actual components, concurrent engineering and logistics support factors in the design. A 3D VP is developed in which the user can actually explore the inside of the vehicle. Step 5: virtual Factory - concurrent engineering relative to the actual manufacturing processes is provided in parallel with the detailed design phase. The machine tool paths, production line set-up and timing of materials, machining processes and assembly lines for production of parts and the assembly of the whole vehicle system can be laid out and tested prior to the actual implementation on the factory floor. This results in significant time savings and reduction of scrap material. Step 6: Crew Station Development - The virtual mockup results in a crew station envelope which is used to establish the crew station design using the soldier-in-the-loop crew station simulator under static and dynamic conditions. The crew station simulator is connected to the Distributed Simulation Internet (DSI) to enable a seamless battlefield simulation using remotely located manned simulators to enable the battle labs to evaluate effect of the concept design on tactics and force effectiveness. Phase I: Develop/adapt computer models that support or perform one or more of the functions described in the VP steps 2 & 3 described above for combat vehicles. Phase II: Develop an automated transfer of information within and/or between the steps described above.

However, the mission requirements of the next generation of tactical missiles will demand a level of propulsion system flexibility that can not be met with a standard solid rocket. On-demand thrust control will be required, which will dictate the use of non-traditional solid propellant based propulsion systems such as: ducted rockets, hybrid rockets, and Air Turbo Ramjets (ATR). The solid fuel variants of these propulsion cycles employ a fuel rich gas generator as the fuel source. To obtain high performance (thrust), the gas generators of these systems must operate at relatively high maximum chamber pressures (up to 7000 psig) and temperatures (up to 2500 degrees F) levels. In addition, to provide thrust control (throttling), the mass flow rate of the gas generator must be modulated over a wide range (up to 10:1 turn down ratio). Finally, the flow rate modulation must be available on demand and under computer control. To successfully develop high pressure, high performance, throttleable, solid fuel tactical propulsion systems, an on-demand throttling device is required. Thrust control of each respective engine can be effectively achieved through modulation of the gas generator fuel flow rate with a hot gas throttling valve. Consequently, technology is required for the development of low cost, light-weight, hot gas valves that can be utilized in the next generation of Army tactical throttleable solid propellant systems. The valves to be developed must incorporate the following features: compatibility with common gas generator solid propellant (e.g. AP/HTPB, GAP/C), flow rate insensitivity to downstream pressure fluctuations, maximum linearity over operating range, minimal hysteresis, 5:1 flow rate turn down ratio (10:1 desired), minimum 5000 psi chamber pressure (7000 psig desired), minimum 2500 degree F chamber temperature (3000 deg F), minimum 60 sec full throttle operation, rapid actuation (minimum to maximum flow rate in less than 100 msec), functionality with metalized fuels, low cost design consistent with tactical missile systems, minimized weigh t, minimized volume, electrical activation (analog or digital), continuum of on-demand available flow rates, self-contained sensors and feed-back control (if required), 10 year shelf-life, compatibility with tactical missile environment (storage transportation, and operating), compatible with microprocessor control, adaptability to a wide range of engine cycles and configurations. The system must take advantage of the expendable, short duration mission of tactical missiles to minimize cost and reduce weight and volume. Use of commercial (not aerospace) grade components are desired. The valve should employ generic technology and should be scaleable to accommodate a wide range of maximum flow rate (.1 to 50 lbm/sec). Phase I: Under the Phase I effort, a heavy-weight, high pressure hot gas valve shall be designed, developed, fabricated, and demonstrated. This system shall be sized and designed for integration and operation with the MICOM Propulsion Directorate sub-scale direct-connect ducted rocket test facility.

Specific details of the MICOM sub-scale test hardware shall be provided after contract award. The device should incorporate as many of the desired features as possible. The contractor may demonstrate the system utilizing cold gas or inert hot gas. The demonstration must include some form of control system (preferably P.C. based) that can be employed to demonstrate on-demand flow rate control. At the completion of the effort the device must be delivered to the Government with any associated test hardware, control hardware and software (including source code) for independent experimental direct-connect evaluations utilizing a solid fuel gas generator and a ducted rocket combustor.

Engine power density can also be increased because the engine can be run at its optimum power speed for high power loads. The PFC components condition alternator power to produce MIL-STD frequency and voltage (such as 60 Hz and 120 VAC) independent of engine speed. Commercial 1,800 rpm, 60 Hz alternators represent static technology with little performance improvements foreseeable. Power semiconductors (the major component of the PFC) are a rapidly advancing technology with excellent potential for further size/weight reductions in the future. Phase I: The contractor shall determine optimum HFA-PFC design options for the following power ranges: 5-30 kW, 30-100 kW and 100-1,000 kW. Determine the optimum HFA design and the optimum power semiconductor technology and topology for the given power ranges. Phase II: The Government can determine the optimum power range(s) to be explored during Phase II based on Phase I results analysis and review.) The contractor shall fabricate and test prototype full scale or sub-scale (as appropriate) versions of the HFA-PFC. The mobility and deployability benefits due to weight reductions shall be quantified along with studies to determine producibility and logistics issues associated with HFA-PFC based gen-sets. Potential Commercial Market: HFA-PFC technology would be applicable to the commercial gen-set market segments where size/weight and/or fuel efficiency are key concerns. The major life cycle cost element of commercial gen- sets is fuel cost, so being able to produce 60 Hz at the most efficient engine speed could be a distinct advantage.

The current approach is based on well known hybridoma technology and, while successful, has several drawbacks. Time required to develop a particular antibody is long, impeding the Army's ability to quickly respond to new threats; production is relatively expensive; hybridoma cell lines are often unstable; it is not possible to design antibodies with particular binding characteristics. Phase I: The objective is to demonstrate the ability to develop a phage display selection system, construct an immunoglobulin gene library and select specific antigen binding clones. A plan for selection, mutation and expression of high affinity clones in a bacterial system will be described for successful transition to Phase II. Phase II: Two objectives will be pursued for Phase II. Parameters for scale-up of the bacterial expression system to at least 30 L will be defined and demonstrated, and antibody yields will be optimized. Second, specific antigen binding peptide fragments will be developed from existing cDNA libraries without using immunized animals. Potential Commercial Market: The products and processes developed from this project will have widespread applications in environmental monitoring (e.g., pesticides in soil and ground water), industrial processes (e.g., test kits) and agriculture (e.g., antibiotics in milk).

Modern information systems such as Tactical Information Broadcast System (TIBS), Common Ground Station (CGS), Intra-vehicle Information System (IVIS), and All Source Analysis System (ASAS) ensure the commander a plethora of battlefield information during the actual battle. If all the information was forwarded to him, not only would the commander be overwhelmed, but his staff would be inundated as well. Smart filters are needed to automatically extract the critical information for the commander and ensure its timely display. The problem is multifaceted; it requires a thorough understanding of the cognitive requirements of the commander as well as intelligent software that can interpret the commander's requirements. Research at ARL (Warner, 1993) indicates that the type and format of information the commander requires is highly dependent on his tactical decision task. This suggests that two related problems need to be solved in conjunction with an adaptive information filtering system. The first involves research in how to capture the commander's mental model as critical information is being received during the heat-of-battle. The second problem is how to produce artificially intelligent software that extracts battle critical information for the commander. Simply extracting information from multiple information sources could easily result in a mismatch between the commander's ongoing decision processes and the display of the current battle situation. In fact, the commander's information requirements are likely to be highly individualized and to change as a function of where he is in the battle. The filters must act as a ""pull"" system and be intelligent enough to adapt to individual commanders as well as adapt to the changing information environment. Phase I: The initial effort will demonstrate adaptive logic for filtering battlefield information. The adaptive logic must be based on individual commanders inputs and be able to change as function of battlefield conditions. The first phase shall demonstrate that a subject matter expert's (SME) information requirements, preferred formats, and changing tactical priorities could be represented in software to serve as the criteria for an adaptive filter and display system. The criteria would set filter parameters which automatically parse incoming intelligence and battlefield information for high value information. The culmination of Phase I is a demonstration of an adaptive information system that filter incoming data and display the type and format of information based on the individual commander's preference structure. Phase II: The second phase will demonstrate individualized software modules that can be easily programmed by military operators. Using simulation experiments, advanced natural language processors, and cognitive engineering technology, a practical interface environment for the commander will be designed. The interface shall define the commander's requirements for battle management and shall be easily implemented as part of the planning process. The interface an d underlying software shall be rapidly prototyped and rigorously tested in field and realistic simulation exercises to evaluate the concepts in near operational environments. Potential Commercial Market: The potential market would be high volume banks, stockbrokers, and large scale inventory control systems--any industry that is inundated during peak business hours.

As such, it is not particularly useful in naturalistic decision-making research where the mental models are very dynamic and interaction with the researcher alter the decision-making process. Yet prior research on decision-making and problem solving expertise has shown that problem representation is a key aspect of this expertise. Also, if there w as a rapid means of externally representing mental models, it who greatly enhance the building of shared understandings. A related research problem is inferring the knowledge structures that underlie the mental model. Our interpretations of the external world are based on the interaction of goals with our knowledge of the objects and relationships involved in the problem situation and task. What a subject typically conveys in a problem solving protocol is the interpretation (i.e, mental model). The reasoning involving the underlying knowledge structures may never reach conscious awareness, especially if the subject is an expert. We need a reliable means of inferring those knowledge structures from resulting mental models. Phase I: Phase I will involve the identification and evaluation of means of rapidly representing mental models. The expected result is the selection of two methods to be tested in Phase II. Phase II: Phase II will begin with final selection, development and validation of a method. Subsequent work will involve research into inferring underlying knowledge structures from mental models and applying the method to groups in the development of shared mental models.

Phase I: Develop an assay to aid in evaluation of the immune status of antibody-negative subjects and to monitor the disease process and vaccine development for one agent of interest. Phase II: Show the utility of immuno assay(s) for other classes of agents of interest. Potential Commercial Market: Monitoring cellular immunity may be used to evaluate immune status of antibody-negative individuals vaccinated against a variety of infectious diseases. Development of a sensitive quantitative test of cellular immunity would be of potential interest to all vaccine manufacturers in order to quantify levels of protection demonstrated by a new or existing vaccines.",178,1223,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62269/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62269/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:36:15,,,,,A94-083_62269,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C2_A94-083,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:47.369826+00

Furthermore, parenteral administration of the vaccine by trained medical personnel considerably increases the cost of vaccination. Therefore, biodegradable microspheres for the encapsulation of vaccines with or without immunoadjuvants are needed which would evoke complete protection for a duration of at least one year by single administration. Toxins of principal interest include ricin, microcystin, botulinum toxin, saxitoxin and staphylococcal enterotoxins, clostridial perfringens toxins as well as other low molecular weight, peptide, and protein toxins. Infectious agents of interest include anthrax, plague, tularemia and selected virus diseases (e.g. VEE). Phase I: Demonstrate feasibility in laboratory animals, using a vaccine against agents listed above. Phase II: Extend to include preclinical trails to support in submission.

The result will demonstrate the application of cost effective, lead-free environmentally safe alternate materials for small arms ammunition.","The successful development of two small caliber ammunition rounds, the type classified Caliber .50 saboted light armor penetrator (SLAP) and the 7.62mm short range training ammunition (SRTA), was due to recently developed engineered polymer resins. The SLAP utilizes a polyetherimide, PEI resin while the 7.62mm SRTA consists of a high density, 85% bronze filled nylon-11 material. Both are high temperature, high performance type engineered resins. Further development in the area of high performance polymer compounds could result in the identification of a material suitable for application in small arms ammunition projectiles. The development of this material would result not only in lower projectile costs due to the fact that the time consuming and costly practice of removing lead from practice ranges and lead dust from processing areas will no longer be required. In addition, various starches and other proven biodegradable additives can be incorporated in the polymer resin resulting in a non-toxic material that will decompose completely in water or soil leaving no synthetic or toxic residues. The metal injection molded projectile development program will utilize high density, metal injection molded compounds of fine metal powders in a polymeric binder. Metal materials would include bronze, stainless steel, copper, and/or aluminum. Specific gravities of 6.0 grams/cc have already been achieved with copper filled polymer compounds and it is estimated that specific gravities of 10-12 grams/cc (steel is approximately 8 grams/cc while lead is approximately 11.5 grams/cc) can also be achieved with additional research. Alloys of these materials will also be used in order to control the cost and physical properties of the material such as specific gravity, compressive/tensile strength and elongation. These materials will be engineered to provide the characteristics required of small arms ammunition with the 7.62mm M80 cartridge serving as the test bed for this development. Phase I: During the initial development effort the properties of existing polymer compounds will be analyzed to determine the effects of various alloying materials on the physical properties of the compound. In addition, a literature search will be conducted to determine the toxicity of the candidate materials. A matrix of required and desired material properties for the polymer projectile core will then be generated. This information will form the basis for the development of several candidate polymer compounds. The contractor will then mold polymer projectile cores using the developmental compounds. The cores can either be molded directly in the existing metal projectile jackets or molded separately and later inserted into the jacket. Phase II: The prototype projectiles will be delivered to ARDEC for ballistic test and evaluation to determine their safe and effective use in 7.62mm M240/M60 series machine guns as well as any effects on projectile flight characteristics due to the core material. It is anticipated that several iterations of development, fabrication, test and evaluation will occur during this effort. If this material/projectile is successful in 7.62mm applications, expanded applications can be investigated: e.g. 5.56mm, 9mm and .50 caliber ammunition. Potential Commercial Market: The technology developed under this program can be utilized by all commercial manufacturers of small arms ammunition. Currently, there is a great deal of concern in the private sector over the contamination of shooting range s due to high lead content. For the armed services, the development of a non-toxic alternate material projectiles would allow continued training on ranges that are currently in danger of being closed due to the high levels of lead contaminants in the surrounding areas. In order for both the military and public ranges to remain open, costly clean-up procedures that provide only a temporary solution are required. Use of the alternate material projectiles will allow the soldiers to continue training on existing ranges, thereby enhancing their combat effectiveness, without the associated range clean-up expenses. OSCRS: This technology will provide cost reductions over the entire life cycle of the ammunition. Full scale production costs will be substantially reduced and costs associated with the decontamination and clean up of firing ranges will be virtually eliminated. Other benefits include improved product uniformity and improved ammunition accuracy as well as the identification of an alternate lead free material for small arms projectile s.",685,4594,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62271/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62271/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:36:16,,,,,A94-085_62271,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C2_A94-085,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:47.369826+00
