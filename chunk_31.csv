Boundary layer measurements provide little information to the analyst or test engineer to define the complex fluidic interaction that is occurring. In anticipation of the development of high speed and high resolution video imagers, the capability is desired to generate calibrated imagery of this flow structure during flight and especially during transient events such as stores separationand maneuvers or ballistic range events. This effort will define the feasibility of generating interferometric or other nonseeded flow images which can be sotredon film or recorded via an electronic imaging device. The technique must be compatible with a high performance aircraft environment, fit into an aircraft instrumentation pod (10 feet by 16 inches diameter) and provide single-ended measurement capabilities. Short exposure times are required to minimize the effect of the aircraft or ballistic range vibration and to provide information on transient shock formation and travel. For ballistic range applications, the requirement is to apply large format imaging focal plane sensors to arc gap/laser diode synchronized shadowgraphic image capture of projectiles or models which are gun launched in ballistic ranges. For current test configurations a resolution of 0.004 inches is required over a four by eight foot area of interest (field of view) for each camera. A single or multiple exposure is required for each camera with the data temporarily sotred in a memory device until transmitted to an image storage and processing workstation. Phase I will be a study of the application of flow visulation techniques to the aircraft/ballistic range/wind tunnel environment and a laboratory demonstrataion of the applicable phenomena. Phase II will be the proof of principle systems demonstration for ballistic range, wind tunnel and/or flight testing.

Some are melt cast, plastic-bonded, pressed, gels or slurries. However, they all have in common the problem of being sensitive to inadvertent initiation by various stimuli either during processing, manufacturing, or storage. There are many systems known that can be mixed to formulate explosives, but are inert or nonexplosives when unmixed. Many of these systems use strong oxidizer salts, e.g., ammonium nitrate or perchlorates with other salts, liquids and sensitizers. Explosive systems that can be mixed in the ahrware before or during release from the aircraft are conceivable. Systems with energy equal to or better than the current tritonal fill are desired. New materials exhibiting a variety of physical and chemical properties are needed for these type systems. The benefits are rapid, safe and economical weapons replenishment for the services. The goal of Phase I is to study the feasibility of various compounds which are explosives only when mixed. These systems would then be physically and chemically characterized to verify they are not explosives as separate items, but are explosives when indeed they are mechanically mixed. Safety screening and explosive characterization tests will be conducted on all components and systems. Phase II would continue the study on a larger scale by testing and characterization of the detonation properties and mixing techniques for these systems.

RF fuzing is susceptible to countermeasures, while active optical fuzing has all weather limitations. The possibility of using long wavelength infrared (LWIR) sensing for air-to-air missile fuzes is being explored. The purpose of this program is to develop miniature waveguides or fibers suitable for photon transmission over the 8 to 15 micron wavelength band in order in advance the state-of-the-art in target detection technology for air-to-air missile proximity fuzes. LWIR transmission lines analogous to optical fiber bundles (used in active optical fuzes) must be developed to achieve target detection with a wide field of view. Presently, no available fiber material or waveguide exhibits good LWIR transmission over path lengths as small as one tenth of a meter; significantly better transmission is required in order for LWIR fuzing to become practical. Phase I should be dev oted to a study of possible transmission devices. Trade studies are needed to ascertain possible viable concepts to be validated in Phase II. Phase II will require the development and fabrication of the transmission concepts recommended in Phase I.

Processors are required for this application which have extended operating capabilities and which include features such as redundancy and error checking. The processor to be developed for this interceptor must be able to withstand a harsh storage and launch environment and must have a shelf life of up to ten years in orbit. The ability to perform pre-launch checkout of the processor is limited due to the extremely short engagement times for the interceptor. Also, the end game processing rate requires that the processor be functional throughout this critical time. The volume and mass available onboard the interceptor are extremely limited and therefore minimize the amount of redundancy which can be employed. The primary goal of this effort is to develop fault tolerant techniques which will allow the interceptor to perform its mission. The developed techniques should allow for error checking of functions during flight of the interceptor and should provide for alternate paths and graceful degradation in the event of component failure. Phase I of this effort will be a study of the requirements for fault tolerance onboard the interceptor including a list of critical functions and timing required for those functions. The study will also identify available techniques for implementing fault tolerant schemes to insure that essential functions are performed. The study should include an assessment of the impact of each technique on processing speed, and on interceptor mass and volume. Phase II of this effort will be design and development of a breadboard processor employing the technique from Phase I which appears most capable of meeting the interceptor goals.

This particular requirements has arisen from the advent of effective countermeasures in the RF and 3-5 microng range and the substantial increase in target velocities. A solution may be within reach due to recent major breakthroughs in the manufacturing technology for diamond coatings/films. Diamond exhibits excellent structural properties and IR transmission characteristics. The fundamental goal of this task is to develop the ability to apply a diamond film/coating to the substrate dome material of a tactical hypersonic missile operating in the 8-12 micron region. The technical challenge is to apply the diamond coating to a hemispherical substrate material without seriously degrading the transmission characteristics through material bond disunities, the polycrystalline structure of the coating,or mismatches betweent he refractive indices. The cost of a diamond coated dome must not exceed the current cost for a dome by more than a factor of two.

This lack or review can lead to incorrect reliability analyses, which lead to low reliability designs. The Air Force is then left with a costly redesign of the system. Reliabilty and system engineers do not have the technical training for this evaluation. The thermaldesign should be revealed at the same time as the reliability design. But there is usually a shortage of time an thermal design information. An in-house research project at RADC has shown that the basic technology to solve this deficiency exists today. The in-house project also evaluated the existing thermal analysis computer programs. These programs did not meet the need for the system normal evaluator because of their complexity. The in-house project produced a proof of concept expert system for a circuit board thermal analysis. This expert system combined artifical intelligence techniques and thermal analysis methods to create a program that incorporated the analysis experience of a heat transfer engineer.

The predicted material response allows a potential failure mechanism to be identified and corrective design modifications to be made. Two technical problems, particularly with vibration simulations, often occur. First, there may be unknown or poorly known required finite element analysis input data. This includes knowledge of the vibration and shock loadings; attenuation or magnification of the loading due to structural interfaces between the load application region and the potential failure region; physical or structural support stiffnessess; and material properties, especially damping valves. The second problem, particularly with micro-electronic devices, is excessive modeling effort due to the large relative size differences between the stress and failure regions of interest and the device size. Experimental testing, on the other hand, has shortcomings. Prototypes must first be fabricated. Interfaces with the upper level hardware must be simulated with appropriate mockups. Locations of force applicaitonand response measurement points are uncertain, and without any prior experience, are likely to be inadequate. Appropriate vibration experimental measured data could be used to help solve the above problems.

One requirement common to all these reactors is a gas vapor metering system that controls the concentration of the reactants injected into the reactor. Presently, heat capacity based Mass Flow Controllers (MFC) having a repeatability of .1% are commonly used to control the carrier gas flow through a liquid or solid metal organic reactant bubbler. From the reactants equilibrium vapor pressure, a capor concentration can be assumed. Unfortunately, this assumption is not always valid. Some metal organic reactants such as Trimethyl Indium have been shown to have a long startup transient to reach a steady state and to change its vapor pressure with use. Another shortcoming with the present gas metering systems is that for some applications such as the deposition of repeatability of the MFC is marginal. Therefore, an innovative vapor concentration metering system would have widespread application. Most important, it would improve the yield of the semiconductor devices for use in Air Force systems. The metering system must be compatible with ultrahigh purity semiconductor deposition systems. It should be a reasonably priced standalone instrument that can be retrofitted into existing systems.

On transmit, the directional coupler asked for in this effort should pass with unity gain, no loss, and no phase dispersion for the exciter signal that provides the transmit pulse for the radar.

One signal should leave the T/R module along the path of the transmit signal previously described while the second coupled signal needs to be weighted by the ratio of the Bayliss to Taylor distribution at each element.

Some examples are: a. The USAF has a need for a reliable means of evaluating vapor and particulate fraction exposure to various forms of isocyanates during applications such as painting and foam production. In the absence of a reliable method, overprotection in the form of costly and uncomfortable respiratory protective equipment must be used. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analytical method for isocyanates was withdrawn by NIOSH from approved methods leaving no acceptable method for evaluated exposure. Surrogate techniques involving calculations based on solvent content of paint or measurement of pigment are inadequate. A method which captures and measures both free and polymer foam is needed. b. This study would determine the feasibility/cost effectivness of using soil gas survey methods in the remedial performance and long-term monitoring stages. The law requires performance monitoring at least every five years after the enacting of remedial action at Installation Restoration Program sites. The Air Force also considers long-term monitoring as an alternative to remedial action. The Occupational and Environmental Health Laboratory (AFOEHL) is charted for the long-term monitoring and is likely to perform the performance monitoring as well. This requires field sampling and laboratory analysis which are expensive and have at least a 2-month time lag after sampling. Soil gas methods may be cost-effective and produce real-time data at wells and grids dedicated for performance and long-term monitoring purposes. However, there is no record of this application. There is a need to determine the feasibility of soil/well-head gas survey with comparison to the collection of water and soil samples and established protocols for the implementation. c. The USAF needs to determine the influence of purging and sampling methods on volatiles in low permeability wells. Many Air Force Installation Restoration Program monitoring wells are installed in low permeability clay/rocks which run dry after purging one well bore volume. Consequently, it takes a long time for the well to recover and to sample. The problem is when to sample – after four hours, one day, or after the well is almost returned to its static level? This is not only tied to the representativeness of the collected water sample but also requires significant labor hours compared to a high permeability well. The effect of anular space and filter pack on the water sample shall be determined. It is claimed that ground water seep through the dewatered filter packs will be aerated and thus lose its volatiles. Sand tank experiments and field tests are necessary to determine the design of a monitoring well and the time of sampling. The result of this study will enable the Air Force and DOD to get protocols for sampling low permeability wells.",472,3026,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/53617/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/53617/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:28:49,,,,,AF90-058_53617,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_AF90-058,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:09.692752+00

Knowledge Transference and Innovative Decision-Making in Distributed Command and Control Environments. Objective of research is to investigate the group decision making issues that arise when the group is in a ""distributed” or noncollocated environment; linked by a computerized network; and attempting to maintain an innovative stance when planning for the inherent uncertainty of battle. In order to protect resources in the event that an attempt is made to neutralize command center functions, the option to distribute command and control is a consideration. It one mode within a network is neutralized, another node should be bale to overcome the loss and continue operations. This presents a difficult and unpredictable situation as network functions are increasingly computerized. One of these functions, battle planning, may suffer greatly if there is an inability to rapidly share/trade understanding of situation assessment information (often across a computerized network) with other nodes in the network and a propensity to rigidly follow ""old” battle plans which are not keeping up with the rapidly shifting battle. In other words, how does the battle management team deal with replanning ""on the fly?” Prior research dealing with expert knowledge mental models, indicates resolution may be determined by a greater understanding of the battle situation and ability to rapidly change and/or improve their decision making to accommodate the rapid changes in the battle. Along these lines, if the battle management group is able to share a ""mental model” how do they rapidly change that model commensurate with the change in the battle situation? Can this method of knowledge transference be captured and built into a group training system? b. Reorganizing, Dynamic Network Performance Analysis Tool. Copmlex systems, such as systems, can be represented in terms of the processes which are performed, the resources which are used to accomplish the processes, the organization which define the lines of authority and coordination for the processes and resources, and the goals which are established for the organizations and processes. Current network analysis tools, such as Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) and Colored Petri Nets (CPN), allow for ways of analyzing dynamic networks based upon the structural and behavioral relationships which exist between processes and resources. This existing tool kit must be augmented by including the goals and organization dimensions into the analysis methodology. The four dimensions of process, resources, organizations, and goals should be organizaed into a database which relates the mappings of each dimension onto each other. Using these interrelated elements, algorithms should be developed which allow the resulting network description to be reorganized and restructed as changes occur to the four analysis dimensions. The Phase I product should be a technical report giving complete description of how the four dimensions are related, the format of how the relationships should be defined and the algorithm which map the descriptive elements onto the network model. Along with the technical report, a story board, portraying how the resultant system would operate, should be delivered. The Phase II product should be a working prototype of the reorganizing, dynamic network performance analysis tool.",507,3377,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/53687/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/53687/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:28:49,,,,,AF90-059_53687,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_AF90-059,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:09.692752+00

Design (Phase I) and fabricate (Phase II) a standardized task battery to quantify and assess the key metrics of dexterity, manipulation, and force feedback for human controlled robotic systems. Presently, no standardized approach exists to identify and measure these key parameters. The challenge is to identify and design a set of instrumented tasks that measure the important parameters of telerobotic task accomplishment and force feedback. Also needed are data acquisition set ups and authenticated analysis routines. b. Design (Phase I) and fabrication (Phase II) of a force reflecting master for telerobotic (supervised autonomy) aerial refueling. Current technology relies heavily on direct viewing with little or no visual signals of successful boom insertion. Force reflection to the boom operator could help to prevent over stressing of refueling components. System design and force reflection algorithms should be compatible with existing boom paradigm (flaperons and ailerons instead of motors, for example). The technologies should also be integrable into existing aircraft. Technologies could include machine and operator vision systems for supervised autonomous (with human backup) insertion operations. One challenge is to provide useful feedback to the operator while accounting for the dynamics of three independent coupled systems. c. Design (Phase I) and develop (Phase II) advanced interactive graphics models for real time visual display of flexible telemanipulator arms. The challenge is to acquire and integrate real images with graphical representations of refueling aircraft and boom in real time to portray the actual state of the operation and dynamics of the system. Enhanced situational feedback might add microscopic and macroscopic views to the standard view. Solutions should minimize modifications to the involved aircraft (i.e., use existing light of receiving aircraft). d. Design (Phase I) and fabricate (Phase II) instrumented generic master/slave tools for robotic grasping research. Routinely robotic systems measure the force, torques and tactile pressures at the end effector. The challenge is to instrument generic tool shapes to quantify internal strains along principal axes and locate grasper contact points/forces. The objective is to quantify manipulation parameters at the tool level.

Advanced line-of-sight Helmet Orientation and Position Measurement Systems and reduced sensitivity to field distorting materials and reduced system installation complexities in aircraft cockpits. Current military systems that incorporate rugged, lightweight, helmet mounted transducers use A-C coupled magnetic fields sensitive to conductive and ferromagnetic materials in cockpits, etc. Other environments produce enough field scattering to prohibit A-C coupled transducing schemes. An alternate remote sensing or transducing technique is needed which is insensitive to conductive surfaces, simplifies individual site installation, and is small, lightweight, and rugged. End product Phase II: Flyable Brassboard hardware militarized for the fixed-wing fighter or multi-engine military aircraft environment. End product Phase III: Preproduction hardware for general application to Tri-Service vehicles. b. Advanced Optical Materials/Devices for Aircraft Cockpit Helmet Mounted Displays (HMD) that provide more design degrees0of-freedom per element, reducing weight and improving performance. Current HMDs must obtain monocular fields of view of thirty to fifty degrees, provie an unvignetted exit pupil size of 14 to 18 millimeters, provide image source to eye transmission efficiencies above 50 percent, and accommodate eyeglasses. Binocular systems with full, or almost full, eye overlap are desired. Keeping head-born weight below 3.5 pounds and maintaining a reasonable head/helmet center of gravity is difficult. Weight savings must be obtained in the helmet without sacrificing protection and in the optics without sacrificing performance. Aspherical and holographic elements often have insufficient performance. New materials and optical elements, such as gradient index materials or selective narrow-bank coatings/gratings, are needed. End product Phase II: Prototype HMDs with improved lightweight optical designs. End product Phase III: Flight advanced optical materials for operational evaluation. c. Develop a new HMD design. The helmet-mounted display (HMD) should permit simultaneous viewing of the display image and the outside world. Some project a collimated image onto a helmet-mounted combining surface positioned between the outside world and the eye. Designs that position the display away from the eye and route its image to the combiner via lenses, mirros, and/or fiberoptics, tend to be bulky, heavy, and pose center of gravity problems. The ideal approach would place a flat, lightweight, transparent display directly in front of the eye, integrating the functions of the display and combiner. Flat-panel display technologies hold promise. Problems include the following: simultaneous clear vision of distant and near and adequate transparency and luminance of the HMD. End product Phase I: Design and construct a Combiner Display technology demonstrator with diplay and optics – may be monocular, need not be head-wearable or helmet-mountable. Image generator may be self-contained and need not interface with external graphics devices. Provide a final technical report.

All proposed software systems should run on an IBM/XT compatible microcomputer under MS/DOS. Within this broad topic we invite proposals which address one of the following areas: a. Knowledge representation can run the gamut from formal logic grammars (most rigorous) to freedom text (least rigorous). Much research suggests that an optimal approach to knowledge representation in an ITS may be ""semiformal” in nature. Examples of semiformal approaches to knowledge representation include hypermedia and frame languages. We wish to examine the semiformal approach to knowledge representation. Proposals in this area, therefore, should cover the specification, design, and implementation or a proof of concept ITS in an Air Force domain which uses just such a semiformal approach to knowledge representation. All media, including interactive videodisk (IVD), should be considered. b. In order for ITS to adopt to the instructional needs of individual students, they must be able to dispose skills and knowledge a student posses at various stages of training. Online diagnosis of problem solving abilities is a viable near term goal. Research on student models and Psychometric Theory feed the design and development of a prototype computer based diagnostic testing system. A successful project in this area must design specifications for student modeling, identify psychometric issues and solutions in Computer Based Diagnostic Testing (CBDT) and design, develop, and document a prototype CBDT Software Shell. c.

The recent implementation of a pilot retention bonus is but one example of the use of retention models on which to base policy decisions. Phase I of this project would see a review of relevant military and civilian labor market and demographic models with emphasis on theoretical and empirical soundness. The career retention, and desired experience policies as well as how these policies should be modified in light of increased knowledge about future demographic trends would be key areas of concern. The final part of the first phase of the research would construct a model, based upon the results of the review of existing models, which would be most suitable for Air Force needs. Such a model would include not only pay, compensation, policy, and demographic variables, but also attitudinal factors such as perception of the military, job performance, job satisfaction, accommodation to military life, trends in national attitudes, and others that affect accession and retention behavior. A preliminary test of the model’s capability to explain and predict officer accession and retention behavior in critical occupational areas would be conducted. This test would also focus on how the Air Force must adopt its economic, accession and retention policies to meet changing national and regional demographic patterns.

The development of advanced systems and improved psychologic performance measurements remains imperative for man-machine interface. Proposals should specifically address subtopics: a. Aircrew of high performance fighter aircraft capable of sustained 9-G and high altitude aircraft capable of altitudes, have unique requirements providing for their basic physiologic functions to allow adequate performance. Frequently this performance requires non-machine interface at a highly technical level; i.e., a compromise in performance results in a less than satisfactory equipment function. These environments include high-thermal stress, high-sustained exposures for 30 seconds, long-term continuous operations, hypobarism, rapid decompression, laser eye hazards, and chemicals of warfare. Although protective methods and systems are available for these extreme environmental changes, they frequently do not provide adequate protection for optimal performance. These systems frequently need to be refined or new solutions provided. The Phase I efforts shall address methods and systems capable of improving physiologic aircrew functions. b. There are many life-threatening situations inherent in a chemical warfare scenario. In addition to the obvious risk of exposure, individuals working and wearing the Chemical Defense Ensemble face the extreme hazard of becoming thermal casualties. A device to gather and integrate the biophysical data necessary to determine if a person is a heat casualty, without compromising the integrity of the Chemical Defense Ensemble, would assist in the determination of appropriate medical treatment. Measurements applicable to this task include heat flux, vapor flux, temperature inside the Chemical Defense Ensemble, heart rate, skin temperature, and core temperature estimates. The device would incorporate these values to calculate a category, or rating, of the individual’s thermal status. This information could be used to ""triage” heat casualties, determine the extent of treatment needed to alleviate heat stress/illness, and ultimately return the individual to duty. Phase I is envisioned as a concept and requirements analysis and design of a device for demonstration purposes. Phase II product should be a prototype device that has undergone initial testing. c. Provide on-line physiological assessment of pilot workload and state in aircraft and simulators. Real-time monitoring of pilot state is required now and will be essential on newer aircraft and simulator systems. A physical logical monitor is required which will provide on-line collection, analysis and storage of information about pilot’s heart rate, heart rate variability in two bands, eye blink rate and duration, and respiration. These are reliable measure of operator state and workload. The device can be modular, but must be capable of being worn by pilots during flight and should weigh no more than currently available on-body physiological recording devices. Up to eight hours of battery operation and storage capacity is required. All amplification, signal processing and storage must be accomplished by the device. End product Phase I: Design and prototype development of the device. End product Phase II: Fabrication and testing of the actual simulation and flight environments. d. Use neural networks to process real-time physiologic data to generate a mental workload metric. Classic analysis of physiologic data has failed to measure small changes in mental effort required for different tasks except in tightly controlled, non real world tasks. What meaningful data are generated are often time and computing intensive and thus not available until long after the data are collected. Using the proper set of physiologic measures and applying concatenated neural nets of both supervised and unsupervised types might recognize subtle patterns in data. Even more powerful would be the ability to do this in real time while the subject is performing. Various measures such as EEG, EKG, respiration, temperature, facial muscle signals, GSR, and others have shown some promise when both classic analysis or neural net analysis techniques are used. However, putting a collection of this type of data into a complex neural net has not yet been reported. Phase I product would be a proof of concept demonstration of non real time analysis with a net and the generation of a trial mental workload metric. This demonstration could use a laboratory type simplified task. Phase II products would be a full system that produces a useful mental workload metric in real-time from a complex real world task. e. Agile laser effects and countermeasure interests include methods to evaluate safety hazards from lasers and optical munitions, risk and effectiveness assessment of electro-optical countermeasures, and T&E methodologies for holographic and fact-switch protective devices.

These systems, such as the Adaptive Tactical Navigation System or the Pilot’s Associate System, must find innovative ways to quickly and efficiently process their knowledge base to obtain accurate solutions in real time. Conventional AI development environments have had difficulties in producing efficient run time systems. This is due to the fact that the same code necessary to enhance the development environment tends to slow down the system during run-time. In order to overcome these limitations, AI system designers have had to embed the knowledge base into their own custom run-time AI shells to achieve real-time performance. Unfortunately, the deeper the knowledge base is embedded into the actual code, the harder it is to change the knowledge base when maintenance is necessary. Even though AI development environments offer the knowledge engineer a quick way to develop AI system designer must constantly balance system performance versus ease of maintaining and manipulating the knowledge base. One method to resolve this problem would be to develop and test the system using an AI development environment and then strip out the environment and recode the system to optimize performance.

This approach limited their availability since it required extensive hardware development for each system and a separate simulator for each threat system of interest. Recent efforts have been made to develop truly reconfigurable threat radar simulators to lower the required investment needed to perform simulation testing. To guarantee simulation fidelity, the proposed simulators plan to perform their signal modulations for modeling antenna patterns clutter and target returns at the operating radio frequency (RF) of the threat system. This approach presents difficulties due to the cost and complexity of RF circuit design. An alternative method is to perform the signal modulation at the intermediate frequency (IF) of the threat systems and up/down convert at the interface to the electronic countermeasure system under test.

Considering that future airborne threats are likely to have radar cross sections (RCS) greatly reduced in magnitude form contemporary targets, the ECM sidelobe jamming performance pensity incurred by the X-band fighter radars could be severe. Historically, tactical airborne radars have not incorporated isdelobe ECM cancellers for several reasons. The conventional spatial jammer nulling and subsequent temporalnonadpative ground clutter cancellation two-stage processing has fundamental limitations. Clutter in the auxiliary antenna channels results in the adaptive spatial system attempting to form a null in the main beam direction thus canceling the target. Conversely, the adaptive nulling process raises the antenna sidelobe level which results in increased sidelobe clutter in the Doppler filter bank. Even if clutter is not present, the convergence rate for the class of adaptive algorithms which could be practically implemented is very slow requiring tens of thousands of samples to effect an adapted solution. This slow adaption drastically limits cancellation performance against blinking jammers or when tactical aircraft maneuvers require an inherent ""null steering” capability. Finally, radar receiver hardware errors limit channel matching and sidelobe nulling orders of magnitude less than desired. The state of the art in adaptive processing and digital equipment has, however, progressed to a point where coherent sidelobe cancellers, having the desired rapid convergence rate and ECM nulling performance, are becoming feasible. The Phase I activity will systematically investigate the exploitation of these technologies which include the following: joint space time adaptive processing to eliminate the degrading intersetions between jammer nulling and clutter cancellation that exist in a two step process; adatpvie weight formation by digitally implemented sample covariance matrix inversion (or equivalent Gram Schmidt orthogonalization) techniques to eliminate the slow convergence iterative emethods; adaptive finite impulse response (FIR) filters to reduce receiver hardware channel match requirements; and specialized high speed digital single autonomous node circuits that can be configured to implicitly perform the matrix formation/inversion, adaptive weight determination and adaptive beamforming computations in real time when utilized in high throughput systolic array signal processor architectures. The Phase I output will consist of an adaptive processing algorithm design, radar architecture definition, and digital computer simulation sidelobe canceler performance predictions. These activities will lead to the Phase II effort of laboratory demonstrating sidelobe canceler nulling performace in real time utilizing breadboard digital signal processing, analog to digital converter, and IF/low pass filters to emulate a radar.",427,3151,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/71070/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/71070/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:28:57,,,,,AF90-079_71070,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_AF90-079,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:09.692752+00

The recent evolution of complex multispectral EC systems and corresponding integrated air defense system threat infrastructure have compounded the problem of EC effectiveness evaluation. Current test and analysis techniques have become cumbersome and unresponsive to rapidly changing EC technology. To overcome this difficulty, the ability to graphically portray threat interactions and engagements is anticipated to show significant promise in the evaluation of complex systems by reducing the overall problem of representing system/threat relationships. Hence, the ability to dynamically display threat engagement, scenario and threat characteristics data in a cost effective manner is needed. This effort involves the development and demonstration of graphics tools for EC digital models and ismulators in the Air Force community. Special emphasis on generic tools and standardized graphics software interfaces is important to ensure portability between differing digital models and simulators, and their acceptance by the EC community. The Phase I effort will involve the selection of one or more digital models/simulators for application of the visualization tools, visualization requirements definition, software architecture development and, if possible, small scale development and demonstration.

With software being the current cost driver in avionics, these same concepts need to be applied to the avionics operational flight programs.

The descriptive component examines sensor imagery and extracts potential target features to build a hierarchical representation of candidate targets and to form an initial target identity hypothesis. The predictive component consists of geometric and signature models which are utilized to estimate target features which are then matched to candidate target descriptions at the feature, feature grouping, and object levels. These two components are unified by a central data and data uncertainty representation and reasoning scheme which enforce a uniform representation paradigm for descriptive and predictive data and provides a standard control and integration mechanism for these disparate information sources. Based upon initial match results, feedback is employed to refine the target model prediction and extract additional descriptive evidence in an iterative manner to narrow the uncertainty associated with target parameters such as pose, configuration, and phenomenology. Sources are sought for research in two MBV component areas: a. Multisensor target phenomenology prediction via qualitative physics. The above factors in combination place constraints upon geometry, signature and sensor phenomenology models that are unique to MBV. State of the art qualitative signature estimation approaches generally fail to capture all the necessary attributes required for MBV prediction mechanisms. It is anticipated that a qualitative physics approach to target signature estimation may more readily support critical MBV prediction requirements such as distributed control and uncertainty representation, target feature prediction at variable resolution and accuracy, aggregate feature prediction as opposed to complete target visual renderings, and cause and effect reasoning about energy exchange mechanisms which drive signatures.

In particular, current programs such as ICNIA, INEWS, and PAVE PILAR, as well as future programs such as PAVE PACE, are concerned with resource sharing activities. Collectively, this resource sharing concept is referred to as Total-Integration Avionics (TIA). Reliability, supportability, availability, and maintainability, of these advanced avionics systems are not only desired goals, but indeed, critical requirements. Emerging technologies such as wafer scale integration, photonics, artificial intelligence, parallel processing, neural networks, etc., will play a vital role in bringing the concept of TIA to fruition. Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that a vital part of these aforementioned technologies is software. While hardware resource sharing and functional integration are certainly key elements, it is intricate and complex software systems which represent a driving force behind these technologies. Also, it is well recognized and understood that real time avionics software design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance are extremely resource intensive activities, in terms of personnel, time, and cost. Unfortunately, the emerging CASE tools do not adequately address the full life cycle from requirement specification through design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance. Further, these CASE tools, in many instances are diverse, ill matched, and not suitably integrated in terms of being capable of sharing data and information between other tools. Critical issues such as data interchange formats, user interfaces, common databases, and tool environments remain heretofore unresolved. Yet, it is these CASE type tool which are needed in order to address these monumental software problems.

Although the performance of an optimally tuned filter provides accuracy, it does not provide robustness, that is, any change in the real world system not modeled by the filter may cause the filter to diverge. Thus filter robustness suffers at the expense of accuracy and visa versa. Current efforts in adaptive navigation concentrate on optimally combining information provided by robust yet suboptimal local filters. Multiple Modal Adaptive Estimation techniques adapt to predictable real world inconsistencies, which occur at unpredictable times, by providing filters that are tuned for each mode of sensor operation. In Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation, each sensor then has its own bank of filters, running in parallel, from which to extract state estimates. The filter which correctly models the sensor’s current mode of operation is determined via a residual monitoring technique which compares each filter’s measurement estimate with the actual sensor measurement. The filter with the most well behaved residual history is then chosen for implementation by the navigation system. To provide robustness, divergent filters in the bank are continually reset until they sufficiently model the sensor’s mode of operation. The proposed research will therefore attempt to enhance local tiler accuracy while maintaining overall system robustness by adapting the filter to the environment in real time. Phase I of this effort will be a feasibility study to determine what benefit Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation can provide the filter architecture proposed by the Distributed Kalman Filter Architecture effort. At the conclusion of Phase I, the contractor will produce a final report which documents the contractor’s approach, results and a recommendation as to the potential benefits provided by optimally tuned filters on navigation system accuracy.

Shock interacting can result from compression corners due to ramps, axial corners, bow shock boundary-layer interactions, and coupling effects. These noise sources can increase the acoustic load predictions by a factor of 10 or more. The acoustic loads are significant in the design of the structure to resist sonic fatigue damage. The loads from these noise sources are higher than other noise sources which must be defined more accurately for proper design. Existing prediction techniques are based on experimental data in limited flight regimes. There is a lack of data for shock boundary-layer interaction at Mach numbers around and above three. Also, there is a lack of data for axial offset shock generators, axial corners, and coupling effects. There is a lack of knowledge in the three-dimensional shock interaction effects. Extrapolation of the existing database to Mach numbers above three is very uncertain. The program involves extending fluctuating pressure load prediction methods to the supersonic and hypersonic speed regimes for vehicles with ramps and corners. Phase I activity will center on the definition of three dimensional shock wave boundary layer interaction effects through wind tunnel testing to empirically refine/improve the prediction methods.

The lack of productivity caused by test data delays of months is unacceptable. This project will take advantage of modern electronic and micro mechanistic devices to replace an entire control room of outmoded electronics with a model-bourne system. The system will feature an order of magnitude improvement in the number of sensors available to the experimentalist from 100 to 1,000. It will dramatically reduce test entry times by conducting concurrent multifunction testing and adaptively re-focus the test matrix through integrated and real time data analyses which will drive the tunnel test matrix through algorithms and acquire the data for analysis. Finally, it will allow the acquisition of reduced engineering aeromechanic data within days of the test – not months as currently encountered.

The common thread among these applications is the model. In mechanical design, the designer assimilates knowledge about the functional specifications and the world and produces a model, which is successively refined and improved until the model satisfies all the requirements of the functional specifications and the global constraints imposed by the world. While tremendous contributions have been made using computers to help designers optimize detailed, concrete models, their usefulness in aiding designers in creating has been limited, particularly in the area of mechanical design. This is because model creation requires the ability to reason abstractly, something uniquely human, and because computers have been traditionally used to manipulate details rather than ideas. Manipulating ideas is the crux of the problem in conceptual design. For example, in optimizing a model, a designer may need to decide what size fastener to use to obtain the most economically functional fixed fastener component. In contrast, when creating the model, the designer might have to decide whether the fasteners or some other method of force transmission or component mating. These are vastly different problems. The latter subsumes the former. The conclusion to be drawn is that the amount and content of information to be considered in conceptual design is orders of magnitude greater than that of detailed design, and perhaps most importantly, includes all levels of abstraction. The purpose of this SBIR topic is to begin to explore the requirements of knowledge representation for conceptual design with the ultimate goal of bringing the synergistic of man and machine together as early as possible in the design process.

The conductive integrity of the holes is extremely important since the reliability of the circuits is dependent on the plated-through holes being defect free. Accordingly, multilayer boards are normally subjected to a rigorous testing procedure after manufacture to determine if they function properly. On occasion, manufacturing defects may occur with a defective hole or holes being present. It is normally not practical to reprocess a multilayer board where such defect exists. More importantly, once a board has had the various electronic components mounted, it is impossible to reprocess the board through conventional means. Because of the critical nature of the reliability of such boards, it has been necessary to scrap the boards. In addition to the existence of occasional manufacturing defects, damage to the board can occur after the board has been put into use. As with defectively manufactured printed circuit boards, those boards damaged during use or after installation are normally scrapped, because no practical or dependable solution for repairing plated through holes has been known, and, in particular, no method has been known to repair plated through holes in multilayer printed circuit boards in which the printed circuit board can be repaired to a condition that satisfies original manufacturing specifications and in which the original electrical and structural integrity of the board are achieved so that defects resulting from either manufacture or damage are corrected.

The fastest curing sealants require in the range of three hours to become tack-free and the sealant must be tack-free before fuel can be added to the tanks. Repairs of fuel tanks are slowed because of the waiting for the sealant to cure. Cure is further slowed when the sealant has to be applied and cured at low temperatures. There are products available which can be cured in less than a minute by the use of visible or ultraviolet light. An example is dental fillings. The material used for dental fillings would not be suitable because it is too rigid but it is certainly conceivable that an elastomeric, fuel resistant, high adhesion sealant could be light cured. Such a product would greatly reduce the time required for making integral fuel tank repairs at normal temperatures. It is believed it would greatly improve the low temperature cure problems. It is also conceivable that such a product could be used in production sealing since aircraft manufacturers would like to be able to keep chips out of freshly applied sealant and would like to be able to move parts in the factory without waiting for sealant cure. This is concerned mainly with fuel tank sealing, but a light curling sealant could also be used for other type sealing such as cabin pressurization, potting, and firewall.

More data could be collected from flight tests if better antennas were available. Omni directional antenna coverage is needed. The antennas should not introduce amplitude or phase modulation. Additional challenges include small size, low weight, high efficiency, minimum aerodynamic effects, ability to withstand high temperatures, ability to withstand high vibration levels, and capability for both transmit and receive. Initial development should concentrate on S-band for telemetry an command relay via satellite. Other areas of interest are C-band for radar and L-band for GPS.

A simple receiver should be developed to provide a monitoring capability to detect the occurrence of high power microwave illumination. Support systems at satellite launch facilities may illuminate satellites with high microwave energy prior to and during launch operations. For example, tracking radars, located close to launch sites, use large antennas and high peak power transmitters to achieve the sensitivity to track satellites as they proceed to orbital altitudes. These support systems can exceed the field strength value specified by MIL-STD-4618 for satellite electronic systems at the short range between the support system and the launch site. An innovative design will result in a receiver that can be triggered by an RF impulse similar to a smoke detector. The detector should be as simple and portable as possible because monitoring sites may be remote and power sources may not be available. Some possible uses for the HPM detector include inside transporters during satellite transport to launch base; at off site processing facilities (factories) prior to integration of the satellite and launch vehicle; and at the launch base, both at the pad and at offline processing facilities. Eastern Test Range is also interested in detector development.

The tomography technique, applied to the ionosphere, has the potential of yielding near real time two dimensional electron density profiles versus height and latitude over a wide range of latitudes at low cost. The tomography technique works by making integrated measurements of electron content at a number of sites along a latitude chain, and applying mathematical algorithms to construct two dimensional electron density profiles versus latitude. The overall system design requires cost effective, dual frequency, electron content receivers, a method of communicating data from each receiving location to a central location in near real time, and the development of efficient algorithms for reconstruction of equivalent electron density profiler along the direction of the station chain. In Phase I, system design tradeoffs would be examined including potential methods of obtaining electron content data and performing computations at a central site. Tradeoffs also would be computed on desired profile height and horizontal resolution versus number of stations, communication and computational assets and time required. A possible Phase II demonstration of the concept would be made near existing ionospheric diagnostic facilities located in an ionospheric region where large gradients in the ionosphere normally occur.",252,1752,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66552/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66552/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:29:26,,,,,AF90-157_66552,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_AF90-157,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:10.434714+00

This lidar system has successfully performed in both ground based and balloon borne experiments. In the Rayleigh/Mie backscatter mode, the ABLE system has measured atmospheric neutral density and aerosol profiles from 30 km to the ground. In the Raman backscatter mode boundary layer profiles have been measured. Although capable of cloud detection, the lidar is unable to make any assessment of cloud composition. A conventional lidar of the ABLE type transmits a linearly polarized laser pulse and measures the backscatter from atmospheric constituents including aerosols and clouds. The backscattered radiation is assumed to be linearly polarized in the same manner as the laser pulse, but this has not been experimentally confirmed for various meteorological cases. A polarization uncertainty can degrade the measurement and compromise the accuracy of lidar data analysis. Under certain atmospheric conditions, such as ice crystal formation, the backscatter is expected to be polarization dependent. A lidar polarization system implemented in both the transmitter and receiver optics to permit selectable polarized illumination of clouds and polarization shift analysis of the backscatter, is to be developed. Phase I will consist of a feasibility study and development of a preliminary design of the lidar polarizer.

Primary mirrors may be relatively small, lightweight, easy to fabricate and test. The system may be launched in pieces, but with individual sub telescopes fully assembled and aligned. The phased array telescope must be designed so that the sub telescope positions with respect to each other are not critical. A servo system then adjusts the smaller beam combining optics so that the array achieves the resolution of a single very large telescope. This requires that two conditions be met simultaneously over the telescope’s entire field of view. First, the images must be superimposed with an accuracy of much less than the required resolution of telescope array. Second, the images from each telescope must be phased to the others to an accuracy of much less than a wavelength. The first phased array imaging telescope is now in operation at the Weapons Laboratory. A sensor system estimated pupil geometry errors from phase and tilt measurements on a local alignment beam which is scanned over the telescope’s field of view. The phase and tilt control loops requires a bandwidth of about 50 Hertz because the tolerances on phase and tilt are very tight. The lateral pupil geometry loops operate at a bandwidth of less than one Hertz because pupil geometry tolerances are much looser. The system works but has two problems. First, the sensor optics are very complex because they have to measure piston errors over many points in the field of view. Second, the sensor is subject to bias errors since it is strictly a local measurement and does not utilize any information from the object being imaged by the telescope. The Air Force is looking for innovative concepts to measure telescope misalignments by processing the image of an extended object at the telescope array’s focal plane. If this algorithm is fast enough, it could replace all of our local sensor systems. If it is relatively slow, the traditional local alignment sensor could be retained to control the arrays on axis phase and tilt at high bandwidth. Since this new focal plane sensor would operate on the image of the actual object being viewed, it could also remove any bias errors in the local phase and tilt loops. In Phase I the contractor should develop a concept for measuring phased array misalignments by analyzing the image of an extended object at the phased array telescope’s combined focal plane. The contractor should perform initial algorithm tests with simple images using a computer simulation of a phased array telescope. A the end of Phase I, the contractor should deliver a final report. In Phase II, the contractor should refine his algorithm with a simulated phased array telescope using realistic images and a more accurate telescope simulation.

A typical environment consists of a conducting faraday cage which is lined with varying height of microwave absorber. Although the absorber generally reduces wall reflections, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the angel of incidence and the frequency of the incident wave. Angles of incidence are in turn highly dependent on the pattern of the radiating antenna and its proximity to the object under test and walls. A key goal of anechoic chamber design is to irradiate the object under test exclusively with energy launched directly by the source antenna, even though multiple reflections between imperfectly absorptive walls, the conducting test object, and the antenna itself, always occur. A second consideration in chamber operation is to utilize antenna and source geometries which simulate free field, plane wave conditions. However, often antenna near field conditions prevail at the location of the test object, because the distance from antenna to test object is limited. Thus, uniformity of HPM illumination over the surface of the test object is adversely affected both by near field antenna effects as well as by waves partially reflected from anechoic chamber walls. A need exists for a personal computer based, innovative expert system to aid in the planning, execution, and interpretation of high power microwave effects testing. The expert system embodied in software should allow calculation of all relevant electromagnetic quantities at any point exterior to the test object when the antenna geometry and operating mode, radiated power spectrum, approximate test object shape, and spatial distribution of wall absorber are given. Of particular interest is the variation in power density over the surface of the test object. The expert system should be able to carry out near field calculations for a wide variety of antenna types and should adequately treat, as a minimum, the effects described above. Phase I work should explore potential novel, computationally efficient techniques for calculation of the spatial distribution of power density and other electromagnetic quantities in the presence of multiple reflecting surfaces as described above. Novel methods for near field calculations of a wide variety of HPM antennas should be included as a subset of the proposed expert system. Phase II work will involve implementation of the methods proposed in Phase I research on a personal computer to produce the expert system.

At these power levels, many Air Force applications, such as Infrared Counter Measures (IRCM) and optical communications exist for such a compact, robust light source. These applications, however, require sources which are wavelength tunable or, at least, operate at a non-absorbing wavelength in the atmosphere. The current semiconductor materials suitable for diode lasers do not contain band gaps which allow this. A solution to this problem is to use an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with the diode laser as the pumping source. The output of this device would be tunable through either temperature or incidence angle control of the nonlinear crystal. Although OPOs have been demonstrated with several other laser sources, none have been demonstrated with diode lasers. Reasons for this are: High Intensities are required for the nonlinear process of the OPO to occur. The output power of a single diode laser is typically in the mw range. Since the OPO intensity requirements cannot be met with single devices, diode arrays must be used. OPOs also require a clean, nearly diffraction limited beam over the nonlinear interaction length. The output of such arrays only approaches the diffraction limit when coherence of the entire array is achieved. The beam must be focused to a very small spot to achieve the required OPO intensity level. Focusing the beam this tightly shortens its Rayleigh Range and, therefore, the effective interaction length. This impacts the overall gain of the OPO since it is a function of the intensity length product. However, possibilities exist to develop an OPO in nonlinear fibers or waveguides, both of which presently exist. Phase I of this program is to design an OPO which is driven by a diode laser source. The nonlinear crystal requirements to be used per diode type will be determined. Examples of such requirements are the transparency wavelength range and the phase matching wavelength range. Once these parameters have been determined, the appropriate nonlinear materials will be research and the proper material or set of materials determined. Also included in Phase I will be the design of the OPO cavity and any required optics. Phase II should apply the designs of Phase I and physically develop an OPO driven by a laser diode source. This development is to include quantification of such figures of merit for an OPO as intensity threshold of the nonlinear process, gain to the device, conversion efficiency from the source wavelength to the desired wavelength and temperature and/or angle tuning parameters of the device. Such an OPO device will be deliverable at the end of the Phase II period. The technology develop is directly associated with initiatives established under Project Forecast II.

In the supercomputing environment though, current programming tools do not provide a high enough level of abstraction for this to be possible. They require that the researcher also be concerned with low level implementation details. These high performance systems also lack any vehicle, other than, and often unruly, relocatable libraries, which favor code reuse. Accordingly, a significant number of new programming efforts involve rewriting code which, usually unbeknownst to the author, already exists elsewhere in the system. In the last few years, a revolutionary new programming methodology has begun to emerge. Entitled Object Oriented Programming (OOP), this approach effectively addresses the above problems via a shifting of emphasis from the code supplier to the code consumer. Many OOP environments are available on small to medium sized computers; however there is apparently no evidence that any such environment has ever been utilized in the development of software on a supercomputer.

Develop portable NDT&E tools employing ultrasonic and other techniques for defect evaluation. NDT&E techniques are needed for investigating defects in solid rocket motors, nozzles, cones and other propulsion components during manufacture, acceptance, static and dynamic testing, shipping and handling, and in the field. Several techniques are in use which require extensive handling of heavy articles at certain facilities. There is a need for the development of portable techniques that are non-hazardous and simple to use that would allow for more rapid and convenient evaluations. Of particular interest for evaluation would be internal surface defects that may be found in large rocket motors such as case/insulation de-bonds, propellant/liner/insulation de-bonds, propellant voids and carbon nozzle defects. Phase I would be to evaluate and validate various concepts. Phase II would be to manufacture, test and validate in the field the most promising concept found in Phase I. b. Develop analytical models for defect/effect evaluation. Current methods for such evaluations are based on somewhat subjective assessments, experience of specific people and limited test. These evaluation techniques and the resultant database are expected to become less useful with time because of rapid changes in materials designs and manufacturing techniques and retirement of experienced evaluators. Current methods therefore need to be augmented with suitable engineering analyses and test methods that can take advantage of automated data acquisition, material modeling and computerized data evaluation. This effort is aimed at the development of automated engineering evaluation methodology. AN evaluation of available performance codes and the definition of another analytical models for predicting structural and ballistic performance of propulsion systems accounting for the effects of defects is required. This effort includes investigation of methods of characterizing material properties with degradations due to defects. Phase II effort will develop computer codes for modeling material properties. c. Detection and evaluation of critical kissing de-bonds in solid rocket motors. Innovative research is needed in the development of NDT&E techniques that have the potential for detecting kissing de-bonds in solid rocket motors such as Minuteman, Peacekeepers, SICBM, and any future ICBM systems. In particular, techniques are needed for the detection and characterization of kissing de-bonds in motor cases, propellant/liner/insulation, nozzle and cones. Current defect detection methods are not totally satisfactory in meeting the requirements of being able to detect all the different types of defects capable of existing in all solid rocket motors. Existing NDT techniques like x-ray call for tangential inspections of the cone at intervals ranging from 10-60 degrees, along with a limited number of through body shots. The degree of success of these techniques vary somewhat in that the procedures only allow a very small percentage of the test item to be inspected. Also, in the areas that are inspected by x-ray, de-bonds/de-laminations can only be detected if the gap is 10 mils or greater, which is the special resolution achievable with the best quality film. De-bonds or de-laminations with gaps less than this will likely not be detected. Since no techniques have demonstrated the ability to detect a de-bond or de-lamination when no gap or a kissing de-bond is present, development in this area is clearly needed. In Phase I, various techniques found in Phase I using lab samples, analogs and actual motors and motor components. Phase II would also provide automated computerized interfaces and defects modeling for the techniques chosen.",559,3793,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66546/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66546/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:29:32,,,,,AF90-173_66546,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_AF90-173,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:10.434714+00

SAR related areas that would be suitable for a Phase I investigation include the following: An investigation of algorithms for creating a SAR image from radar data. This may involve the generation of synthesized SAR data for testing purposes; an investigation of proposed computer architectures and a tradeoff study on their possible performance for SAR imagery; an analysis of figures of merit to describe such SAR imagery and its generation via these algorithms and computer architectures.

Innovative techniques are necessary to meet demanding power density, energy density, reliability, and lifetime requirements. a. Develop and demonstrate power sources for any of the following general ICBM application areas: Basing/Survival Power: This area calls for large, multikillowatt power rates for periods of days to weeks. These power systems must be rechargeable/replenish able and endure dozens to hundreds of cycles over a lifetime of a decade. Boost flight power: Immediately before and during ICBM booster flight, onboard systems will require power in the kilowatt range for up to one hour. These power systems will be used only once but must survive long term storage up to a decade, be compact, have high reliability, and start quickly. Reentry Vehicle Power: Reentry vehicles (RV) have nearly the same power requirements as boosters except they must be smaller and lighter. They typically have a 10 to 100 watt load until the near the end of their trajectory when they must sustain pulsed loads into the multikillowatt range for several minutes. b. Develop and demonstrate a rechargeable RV power source for test purposes. Test vehicles frequently undergo months of testing before launch to ensure that all systems are functioning properly. A rechargeable power system that can meet both the mission requirements and endure 10-15 cycles with an integral state of chart readout would facilitate full scale tests of an RV after mating to the launch system. The energy density should be in the following ranges: Wh/Kg – 100-120. c. Develop and demonstrate a higher voltage cathode design and cathode cell chemistry for thermal batteries.

Develop an ablative pyrotechnic heat shield material to enhance visible and IR optical signatures. It is possible in the future that the Soviet Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system will have the capability to detect and discriminate incoming Reentry Vehicles (RVs) with the use of optics to augment their existing radar systems. During reentry into the atmosphere, the optical signatures from the two different sized vehicles (decoys & RVs) differ by several magnitudes. By developing an ablative heat shield with pyrotechnic materials for the decoy, matching of the RV can be accomplished. The desired end product of Phase I is an initial development of an ablative material which can potentially be used as a heat shield. Concept should be defined and feasibility determined. Phase II will include advanced development of material, and ground tests to include arc jet ablation tests and ballistic range tests at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB TN. b. Develop new methodologies for RCS, IR and visible optical wake/plume signature prediction capability. The offerors are expected to be familiar with the Ballistic System Division (BSD) mission and generally the capabilities of threat radars and optical sensors to detect and analyze wake signatures. Current specific threat information will be available after contract award. The codes developed should provide for the effects of various wake additives on conical ballistic Reentry Vehicles (RVs). Material reaction chemistry will be provided for certain test cases. c. Develop new methodologies for RCS prediction of bodies with protuberances and electrically non-homogenous materials. Improvements and upgrades on state-of-the-art computer codes in the areas of robustness, versatility, speed, and accuracy are expected. The offerers are expected to be familiar with the BSD mission and generally the capabilities of large ABM radars. Current specific treat information will be available after contract award. The codes developed should be applicable to both conical ballistic RVs and shaped bodies such as Maneuvering Reentry Vehicles (MARVs) and Hypersonic Glide Vehicles (HGVs). d. Develop new methodologies for incorporating RF antennas into RVs and penetration aids. Penetration against evolving defense systems requires more design consideration for control of RCS characteristics of reentry bodies while incorporating RF transmission and receive capability. Currently, dielectric surface discontinuities for antenna windows are distinctive scattering centers. Techniques should be investigated that incorporate actively controlled dielectric properties to match surface impedance for non-active antenna elements while allowing low loss transmissivity when required. Materials considered must be compatible with reentry environments. Techniques using distributed arrays over the RV skin should be considered.

Develop a database of the particle size distributions in various types of weather with particular emphasis on high altitude, cirrus (light weather). The types of data availability and quality of these data should be assessed. These data should be examined to correlate particle size with liquid water content for various types of hydrometeors (Ice, small snow, large snow, rain). From this an updated particle size distribution versus altitude should be generated for various cloud types, particularly for high altitude cirrus. Special attention should be paid to data taken over land and over water to insure that differences are accounted for. These updated particle distribution data will be used in support of future reentry vehicle flight tests. b. Develop algorithms to predict the aerodynamics and aerothermodynamics of ballistic reentry vehicles (BRV), maneuvering reentry vehicles (MARV), and decoys including the influence of real gas versus ideal gas. Emphasis is to be placed on heat shield/nose tip ablation, surface blowing, and thermal and chemical equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomenon. Specifically the interest is focused on the location of center of pressure for predicting the trim angles of attack for MARVs. The heat shield ablation can be large where the conventional boundary layer theory or even Parabolized Navier Stokes (PNS) methods become invalid, requiring global iteration PNS or time dependent Navier Stokes methods. The heat shield thermal conduction and ablation are an integral part of the problem and will yield part of the surface boundary conditions. Innovative algorithms with minimal numerical viscosity and damping are sought. The numerical grid generation scheme is an important part of the formulation and the methodology should handle BRV/MARV/decoy geometries of interest to Ballistic System Division (BSD). The Phase I effort should demonstrate solutions for a basic RV/decoy at zero angle of attack. The Phase II effort should extend this formulation to 3D and would include software and users manual delivery with proven BSD supplied test cases. c. Antenna windows of reentry vehicles and the adjacent heat shield currently have a different ablation rate. This difference further augments the overall uneven ablation wear and causes various problems with the performance of the vehicle. An innovative concept is needed to develop sensors to measure recession in ground and flight tests; and develop a mechanical design to reduce the uneven ablation.

In order to achieve 360 degrees azimuthal coverage without access to the missile frontal area, RF fuze systems have employed complex, expensive duplexers, circulators, power dividers/combiners and RF plumbing between the single transmitter/receiver module and remote antennas. The Air Force Armament Test Laboratory (AFATL) is interested in innovative techniques of applying MMIC technology to the problem of air target fuzing. To support the guidance function, future air target missiles will include significant signal processing which can also be utilized by the fuzing system. Recent investigations into azimuthal-target location by air-target fuzing offer a potential solution to the ""early bir/late bird” problem and the option to employ aimable/directional warheads. However, these advances entail increased fuze design complexity and cost. The technical challenge is to apply MMIC technology to transmit/receive (T/R) modules and conformal patch antennas which would individually cover a segment (60 degrees to 90 degrees) around the missile. The individual modules should be centrally controlled, provide azimuthal-target resolution, and eliminate most, if not all RF, plumbing. Phase I will include the analysis and design of MMIC components for a missile proximity fuze. Component designs should then be integrated into an overall system concept. Phase II would include integration, fabrication and demonstration of the conceptual designs from Phase I to show proof-of-concept.

Specifically, jagged surface anomalies on the order of twenty atomic diameters in size are responsible for the electrode’s high surface area which, in turn, gives rise to large capacitance density (up to 1 F/cm2). Mobile ions within the electrolyte concentrate along the electrode surface so that charge is stored in response to an applied voltage. In theory, an IPN interface has extremely high surface area and could be adapted to high-density charge storage; double-layer capacitors can be envisioned from this standpoint.

An issue arising from this trend is how to combine or fuse information from various sensors so as to optimize acquisitions and tracking capabilities of the missile. Initial studies have indicated benefits occur when the fusion process occurs at the sensor level rather than later in the signal processing chain. Separately, microchip processor technology has developed sufficiently to support requirements for real-time data fusion. As sensor data fusion technology continues to progress, signal processing architectures adapted to data fusion with specific sensors will likely be developed for tactical missile guidance. The goal of this task is to develop technology for fusing data from two dissimilar sensors, preferably radar and infrared as used for acquisition and tracking in air-to-air missiles. The intent is to accomplish data fusion by operating on sensor signals that have been processed as little as possible or, preferably, not at all. The technical challenge is to demonstrate feasibility and then develop the techniques of establishing a single track file from data as near to the sensor level as possible. Two dissimilar sensors configured on a common platform are to be used. The thrust of Phase I is to demonstrate the sensor-level data-fusion concept and verify its advantages over multi-track file fusion. Algorithms employed in the demonstration should be as simple as possible and algorithm development kept to a minimum. Sensor-level data of simultaneous radar and infrared scenes may be simulated although real data with clutter is desired. In Phase II algorithms will be expanded and refined as appropriate. Extensive comparative analysis of sensor-level data fusion and processed data fusion will be accomplished to determine the relative performance of each. Tests and analysis will be performed on the best sensor data set available.

For increased energetic performance, it is desirable to minimize the binder content. However, too little binder may result in a mix consistency that is unprocessable. A surfactant is needed, therefore, to act as a wetting/dispersing agent. This allows a reduction in binder content without a subsequent decrease in processability. The candidate surfactants must be compatible with typical PBX components, as well as with the hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) binder itself. In addition, the surfactants should neither adversely affect the mechanical properties of the binder nor hinder the curing process. Melt cast systems, on the other hand, present problems not encountered in PBX mix casting. These formulations consist of an explosive granular filler suspended in molten TNT. The TNT then serves as the binder when solidified. The need for increased solids content result from performance and/or shock sensitivity requirements. Thus, the problem of maintaining homogeneity of the suspended solids needs to be addressed. Lecithin is currently used for this purpose. However, because lecithin is not readily soluble in TNT, a replacement surfactant is needed to act as a dispersing/suspending agent. The surfactants must be compatible with typical melt-cast components and they should not have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties or the solidification process of the TNT binder. Phase I consists of a search for various surfactants to improve the processing mentioned. For each application (mix and melt cast), candidate surfactants will undergo compatibility tests with the individual components, and effects on the mechanical properties of the binders will be determined. Phase II will consist of a complete characterization of potential surfactants for mix processing studies will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the candidates with respect to the relevant, explosive, formulation characteristics.",298,2050,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66108/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66108/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:29:47,,,,,AF91-013_66108,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C1_AF91-013,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:10.434714+00

The opportunity exists to lend automated assistance to the development process through the Software Life-Cycle Support Environment (SLCSE), which is comprised of an extensible set of tools that share a common database. The integration of tools and data structures with the SLCSE will support software fault-tolerance technology and its insertion into the system software development process. In order to effectively accomplish this, it will be necessary to have a better understanding of software fault-tolerance models and techniques, their data inputs and outputs, and the tools that currently exist or need to be developed. It is also advantageous to adhere to standards that directly apply to system and software fault tolerance for enhanced usability, interoperability, and extensibility of the tool set.

One area of significant concern within these varying environments is that of user interface, i.e., displaying information to the user in an easy to understand format. Current software test tools, for example, generate detailed tables that indicate, module by module, the outcome of each test. Many times a high level manager desires a more textual report that provides the overall status of testing activities. In addition, there are numerous applications possible in the area of support for project management. A natural-language text-generation system, in conjunction with project-management and database software, can significantly broaden the usability and applicability of project management reports. Complex tables, figures, and charts can be reduced to meaningful text and keyed to the appropriate level of management. The technical challenges of this effort are to develop the technology to provide this text in a meaningful way: 1) the text is automatically derived from the project development activities; 2) it does not repetitive or awkward; and 3) the manager can immediately obtain the reasons why certain conclusions were made about the status of the project.

Among the serious problems that face the progress of sol gel technology are: incorporation of crucial active elements in the solution and maintenance of stoichiometry during drying, and fracture of films and monolith. For example, in the nonlinear optics (NLO) it is necessary to use sol gel technique to prepare very high silica glass films and bulk pieces containing active elements (e.g. Pb, Ga, Bi, Nd, etc). Incorporating such elements and maintaining the stoichiometry during the process is very difficult.

To date, conventional furnaces, the heating rates are generally slow. Because the material is heated from its exterior, temperature gradients exist within the material during processing. Microwave processing of materials is an emerging and exciting technique. In this novel processing approach, heat is generated within the material by the dissipation of microwave energy. This internal heating mechanism enhances the processing rates, resulting in more homogeneous materials with finer and more uniform structure, thus improving the properties.

An approach to accomplish this is to locally induce shifts in the color-centers of the material through an optically sensitive structural modification and/or an electronic transfer mechanism which effects a change in the refracting properties of the medium through the Kramers-Kronig relationship. Some examples of this development can be found in rare earth-doped phosphate and silicate glasses, and in GeO(2)-doped silicate glass which has an ultraviolet absorption band that can be bleached using excimer laser beams. Since glass can be molded into various geometries, drawn into fiber, and manufactured cheaply, photorefractive glass systems could be quite useful to the design and fabrication of Bragg filters, couplers, optical frequency demultiplexers, and read/write/erase optical memories. Furthermore, research to date has shown that amorphous materials have the ability to record gratings which are in phase with the interfering write beams. This provides a substantial improvement over single crystal photorefractive materials by eliminating phase noise in optical signal processing systems. Widespread application of the rare earth-doped glass systems is currently limited by the low scattering efficiencies of the induced refractive index gratings to optical wavelengths of practical interests in the near-infrared; the GeO2-doped glasses cannot have their photosensitivity tuned to accommodate holographic encryption using other laser systems.

All proposed software systems should run on IBM/XT compatible microcomputer under MS/DOS. Within this topic we invite proposals which address one of the following areas: (Proposals should include the specific subtopic letter as shown below.) a. Knowledge representation can run the gamut from formal logic grammars (most rigorous) to freedom text (least rigorous). Much research suggests that an optimal approach to knowledge representation in an ITS may be ""semiformal” in nature. b. In order for ITSs to adapt to the instructional needs of individual students, they must be able to diagnose skills and knowledge a student possesses at various stages of training. On-line diagnosis of problem solving abilities is a viable near-term goal. Research on student models and Psychometric Theory feed the design and development of a prototype computer based diagnostic testing system. A successful project in this area must 1) design specifications for student modeling; 2) identify psychometric issues and solutions in computer Based Diagnostic Testing (CBDT); and 3) design, develop, and document a prototype CBDT Software Shell. c.

Unfortunately, the available knowledge about MPTS tradeoffs is not well organized or readily accessible; most weapons systems designers do not have all the expertise needed; and most of the needed information on variable relationships is not available in a form that makes it readily available for design purposes. Although computer assisted design (CAD) techniques already permit the study of interactions among large numbers of complex variables the CAD systems, data bases, and expert systems needed to simulate and interrelate Logistics Systems Analysis Records (LSAR), human factors (HF), and MPTS variable do not yet exist. Computer-based technology is needed to: 1) develop data models to facilitate HF and MPTS analysis; 2) enhance the capabilities of current human/machine interface models (man modeling); 3) expand the range of human factors criteria that can be estimated and evaluated in a CAD/man-modeling environment (with emphasis on the impact of human/machine interfaces); 4) integrate these advanced task analytic methods data systems, and analysis tools into a user-oriented, CAD-based, LSAR/HF/MPTS analysis workstation (capable of simulating man machine interfaces and the implications of job design alternatives; and 5) develop design relevant evaluation criteria for us in assessing the merit of proposed human/machine interfaces (for use in contract evaluations). Such a system would enhance and expand the utility of computer-assisted design for the evaluation of human/machine interactions. Ideally, it would link up Logistics Systems Analysis Records (LSARs)—the major source of manpower, personnel training and safety MPTs data—with computer-assisted design (CAD)—the major tool in equipment design. It would also make extensive use of human factors (HF) simulations and data bases. Expert systems to facilitate human factors decisions would be an important part of the total system; and the CAD-based LSAR/HF/MPTS analysis workstation would be used to graphically simulate alternatives.

Aircrew of high performance fighter aircraft capable of sustained 9-G and high altitude aircraft capable of altitudes >60K, have unique requirements providing for their basic physiologic functions to allow them to perform at an adequate level. Frequently this performance required man-machine interface at a highly technical level; i.e., a compromise in performance results in a less than satisfactory equipment function. These environments include high-thermal stress, high-sustained +Gz exposures of 9-G for 30 seconds, long-term continuous operations, hypobarism, rapid decompression, laser eye hazards, and chemicals of warfare, Although protective methods and systems are available for these extreme environmental changes, they frequently do not provide adequate protection to allow aircrew optimal performance. These operational systems frequently need to be refined or new solutions provided. Examples of solutions are protective garments, equipment or methods, systems models, and exposure tables. Phase II will result in prototype hardware that will be transitioned to the HSD Acquisition Group for further operational development. b. Develop advanced decompression/denitrogenation computer systems for real time and predictive decompression sickness risk assessment. High altitude exposure in aircraft, hypobaric chambers and extravehicular activity (EVA) in space result in an inherent risk of decompression sickness (DCS). In the past, general guidelines for safer altitude exposures have been developed through costly time-consuming studies, each specific to unique altitude exposure scenarios. The results of these studies are often difficult to apply to new altitude requirements. Therefore, new, time consuming studies must be undertaken. Rapidly changing technology in aircraft design dictates improved decompression risk assessment capability. Databases exist at USAFSAM that contain information necessary for the development of a standardized altitude decompression/denitrogenation model. Such a standardized decompression software package will permit hardware development for altitude decompression computers. These computers are needed for both real-time DCS risk information as well as DCS risk predictive capabilities. Phase II will result in prototype hardware that will transition to the Acquisition Division for further operational development.

Develop systems to measure currents induced by RF fields in humans. It has been sh own recently that vertically polarized radiofrequency fields in the VLF-VHF band are capable of inducing fairly significant body currents in a freestanding human being. A second problem in the VLF-VHF band of frequencies is that commonly encountered ungrounded metallic objects such as a car, van, bus, etc. will develop open circuit voltages on the order of 30-100 Volts when objects are exposed to incident electric fields of 100 V/m. Voltages are proportionately higher for larger incident fields. Upon touching objects, large currents on the order of hundreds of milliamperes may instantaneously flow through the hand, the arm, and the body. To reduce such problems, limits on these currents have been proposed by International Radiation Protection Agency (IRPA) of the World Health p4@o Organization and the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Canada. Limits on currents promulgated by ANSI C95.4. Instrumentation for determination of induced electrical current in humans is needed so that probes should be self-contained, compact, and wearable. b. Although a probe and system for temperature measurement in radio frequency radiation (RFR) fields are commercially available, there is not an interface to standard laboratory computers. The computer interface will provide an easily implemented method for accurate temperature measurements which are used for two purposes in RFR experiments. The temperature of the preparation is, of course, needed to document experimental conditions; Initial temperature increase at the onset of RFR is used to determine specific absorption rate. The interface will be constructed using standard hardware components and have associated software written for its use. It is anticipated that the connection to the probe will be an appropriate analog-to-digital converter. However, a search must be performed to identify devices which facilitate communication with IMB PC compatible computers. The Phase I feasibility study will be a search for appropriate technology to allow computer interface between commercially available temperature measurement systems and standard computer systems. Initial designs will consider direction connection of a converter to the computer, such as the Intersil ICL7I09. The search will also identify the most appropriate sensor board for a PC expansion slot.

A system is needed to obtain high density, 3D data on the entire surface of the human body, including areas which might be masked, such as under the arms.

During Phase II a prototype system will be built and evaluated. b. Analyze the visual mechanisms underlying the discrimination of small structured targets at supra-threshold contrasts. The human visual system’s capability to detect and discriminate objects is based in part on the luminance and chrominance differences between the object and its surround. The relative contributions of the luminance and chrominance mechanisms in mediating detection, and discrimination varies as a function of the spatial and temporal properties of both target and background.

Human operator awareness of the robot’s work environment adds significant flexibility to mission capability. The challenge is to develop quality feedback from the robot to the operator. Two specific current challenges are: Feedback Control: Control instability may be encountered when the operator feedback control mode switches from position control to force control.

ATLAS has also been adopted by the airline industry as the standard test programming language. There is a current DoD initiative to adopt Ada as the standard test programming language. The government and industry have invested large amounts of money and time into the development of ATLAS test development and documentation tools that do not currently exist for Ada. To effect a smooth transition to Ada, an ATLAS software compilation system is needed that produces Ada test program code to maximize the use and benefit of existing ATLAS tools and expertise while gaining the additional benefits of Ada as a test language. Since there are numerous versions of ATLAS in the DoD and commercial marketplace, offerors should outline how each version can be accommodated in the proposed system to facilitate current vertical integration initiatives in the DoD. Consideration should be given to the modular modification of existing ATLAS compiler products versus new development. By modifying an existing modular ATLAS compiler must of the validated computer design can be retained, thus reducing the risk of development and the time required to field a mature product. An important consideration for selection will be the completeness of the solution, probability of success, and the ratio of investment to product value. Phase I will analyze existing ATLAS computer products, assess the feasibility of an ATLAS to Ada compilation system, and develop the Ada architectural design for implementation. Phase II will involve the modification of an existing ATLAS software compilation system to produce the Ada test program code, development of the Ada test program architecture, validation of the compilation system and the integration and demonstration of a simple test program set on a selected Air Force Automatic Test Equipment System.

Now, a new generation of color CRTs and flat panel/dot-matrix displays are arriving on the scene. Today, new Air Force aircraft systems are designing their respective cockpits to embody these electronic display instruments. Retrofits of existing inventory aircraft are being planned that will incorporate this new generation of electronic display instruments. Regardless of the display instrument technology being employed, the problem remains the same. Namely, to be readable the instruments have to be driven at or near their peak light output performance in order to at least marginally compete with the sunlight that, directly or indirectly, enters the cockpit. This mode of operation causes significantly higher operating temperatures of these subsystems and results in a direct, adverse impact on their reliability and frequency of maintenance. A means of controlling these high ambient light conditions in military aircraft cockpits would eliminate the preceding, abusive, operating mode. This is believed to be attainable via canopies and windshields whose light transmission characteristics can be varied to suit the ambient light conditions. Such variability would significantly reduce ambient light levels in the cockpit; and could be achieved either automatically or under a manual control that is adjusted by the pilot. The latter is preferred; however, either method, or a combination of the two is acceptable. As an objective , in ambient light environments up to one hundred foot candles, the transmittance of the canopy and windshield should be 75% to 85%; a figure that is similar to present day canopy and windshield light transmittance characteristics. Above an ambient light level of two should exist for ambient light levels that are between the two aforementioned limits. Also, under any of the ambient light conditions, smooth gradations in light transmission uniformity across the entire canopy and windshield area, of up to 15%, will be acceptable. The light transmission characteristics of such canopies and windshields would, ideally, not alter the color spectral distributions of the light emitted and reflected by real world objects; nor, would they spatially distort or scatter light passing through them. A non-fluid method for achieving the objective is preferred. The proposed method should include a fail safe mode that would assure maximum transmittance of light in the event of component degradation or failure. Phase I should validate the concept, preferably through lab demos. Phase II would embody Phase I principles in actual canopy/windshield configurations.",417,2778,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/69701/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/69701/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:30:09,,,,,AF91-073_69701,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C1_AF91-073,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:11.054388+00

Additional benefits possible are weight reduction, increased survivability, and reduced heat rejection to the fuel. In the near term, power can originate from gearbox mounted generators, be distributed through a ""smart” fault tolerant electrical system and supplied to the various loads. The system will have the capability to sense faults or damage and reroute power to the highest priority loads,. Extensive built in test capability can be utilized to ease maintenance actions, and crud parts items such as electrical connectors and wiring will be addressed. In the far term, the generators can be buried in the main engines to eliminate the engine and airframe mounted gearboxes. A switched reluctance type generator can be used because of its solid core, fault tolerance, and higher temperature capabilities. It is planned to have the power controls mounted outside the rotating engine core, so that the generator core and windings inside the engine will have a mean time existing components and to define new components which will be needed by More Electric Aircraft.

For lightweight metallic structures, this demand is driving the use of aluminum to higher and higher temperatures. Naturally, with the high demand for increased readiness, sustainability, reliability, and decreased workload maintenance, unreliable aircraft structures resulting from fabrication of component assemblies using incompatible materials and fastener systems cannot be tolerated. Incompatibilities result from a difference in thermal expansion coefficient, galvanic corrosion characteristics and the like. This enhances the likelihood of unreliable, leaky structures as well as reduced durability and fatigue induced failures. The results of a Phase I and II small business innovative research (SBIR) effort, ""Development of an Aluminum Fastener System for Use at Moderate Elevated Temperatures,” indicated that it was feasibly to make a 600 F aluminum fastener which compared structures at higher temperatures due to improved compatibility and high temperature fatigue resistance. The aluminum material temperatures are achievable for aluminum. A number of mechanically alloyed systems using inter-metallic dispersions of A14C3, Al203, Al3Ti are presently being developed to move the service temperature for aluminum up to 900 F.

These doors and panels are frequently removed to service subsystems and the airframe. The majority of these doors and panels are attached using traditional mechanical fasteners including bolts, screws, and rivets. In addition heavy doublers, nut-plates, and collars are required to build up the structure to lower stress concentrations in the fastener holes. The problems with traditional fasteners are well documented. Door and panel removal requires removal of all the fasteners and the reinstallation of the fasteners when the door or panel is put back in place. Removal and installation of the fasteners is time consuming, and often time leads to maintenance induced damage (MID) from tool slippage, over-torquing, use of the wrong fasteners, use of the wrong tool, etc. In harsh environments the removal and installation problems are compounded. The entire process is costly and reduces system readiness and sortie generation capability. For stealthy vehicles fasteners increase signature. This program will develop a hook-loop (analogous to the trade name Velcro material) fastening concept which uses no traditional mechanical fasteners. No holes, doublers, nut-plates, and collars are required in the airframe and panel. Doors and panels held with hook-loop attachments can be removed and installed in one simple step. The hooks and loops are permanently attached to the faying surface of the airframe and panel, and cannot be dropped or lost, leading to foreign object damage (FOD).

These LRMs consist of electronic components, printed wiring boards (PWB), cold plates, connectors, and thermal clamps. The connector, which is the electrical interface to the rack, attaches to the cold plate. The PWB’s containing the components attach to this plate. The connector, which is the electrical interface to the rack, attaches to the cold plate. This plate is also the thermal interface to the rack. The cold plates in today’s systems are typically 1/8 thick aluminum. This is a heavy material and has a high thermal resistance. More importantly, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) for aluminum is substantially different from that of PWB material used in the construction of circuitry. This CTE mismatch is a significant cause of avionic failures due to interconnect separation and PWB delamination and cracking. Also, aluminum adds avionic weight to the aircraft system and allows the electrical components to run at a high junction Temperature (TJ). For example, the junction temperature for a 50 watt, dual sided PWB will increase by about 120 C due to the aluminum plate alone. This increased temperature reduces the life of many circuits by almost a factor of 2.

First, utilization of the classical all-aspect angle, medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) look-down waveform results in the requirement for target detection in the presence of directly competing, diffuse side lobe clutter, which can mask or obscure low radar cross-section (RCS) targets. Secondly, the number of side lobe clutter discrete, that are capable of producing false alarms in conjunction with either the regular antenna side lobe structure or a radome reflection lobe, will increase in direct proportion to the reduction in threats RCS. Finally, orders-of-magnitude reduction in target RCS will result in corresponding orders-of-magnitude reduction in threat signal-to-side lobe jammer ratios unless adaptive side lobe cancellation (ASLC) is employed. However, the presence of side lobe clutter can greatly degrade the performance of conventional ASLCs and, conversely, ASLC operation will reduce directly competing side lobe clutter in a medium PRF or alternative transmit waveforms, and significantly more sophisticated guard antenna false alarm reduction concepts. These will be effective to a degree. However, radar antenna installation under a radome can negate much of the potential performance gain. More exotic approaches, such as design or calibration of the antenna/radome assembly to result in lower installed rms side lobe levels have yet to be developed, and are likely to be costly. With the tremendous increases occurring in digital signal processing technology, airborne radar adaptive processing is rapidly becoming practical and affords the potential of mitigating the side lobe clutter. The Phase I activity will investigate exploiting adaptive processing to solve the all-aspect angle look-down radar mode diffuse and discrete side lobe clutter problems and the ASLC/side lobe clutter signal processing compatibility dilemma.

Past hybrid simulators have been designed as clones as individual threat radars to ensure simulation fidelity. This approach limited their availability since it required extensive hardware development for each system and a separate simulator for each threat system of interest. It also gave rise to inaccuracies in the simulation fidelity due to the significant development time needed to update the design to match frequently changing intelligence assessments. The alternative to the hardware implementation was normally non real-time digital simulation. This approach, while more responsive to change than the hardware implementations could not normally provide the level of fidelity desired without computation times much slower than real time. This topic area seeks to exploit the technology opportunities presented by recent developments in high-speed digital processors, parallel processing architectures, fast digitizers and programmable analog devices to develop a truly reconfigurable, real time, threat radar simulator to perform simulation testing and evaluation. A successful design needs to address all aspects of radar processing functionality: waveform data extraction, angle data extraction and tracking function. Additionally, the design needs to address the real-time performance issues associated with the design.

Much work is already being performed towards producing low loss passive microwave components such as delay lines for signals with power levels well under 30 dBm. Higher power levels, bandwidths, low microwave loss contacts and switches for delay lines are just now beginning to be considered. Initial results are extremely promising, showing there is no intrinsic property in the HTSC materials preventing power levels and bandwidths to be increased with development, especially in short delay lines needed for high power, wide band phase shifters for EW active array transmitters. Polarization control networks for EW applications currently use 8-bit ferrite phase shifters because of their wide bandwidth and low loss. But ferrites are large, requiring they be placed before the corporate feed network of the antenna array. It would be desirable to implement the polarimeters in GaAs Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology and place them directly behind each antenna element of the active array to reduce system size, increase reliability and improve performance. Unfortunately, high resolution GaAs device losses can be as much as 15-16 dB, making them impractical for this application. With development, HTSC will enable practical, high resolution, low dispersion phase shifters which exhibit the low loss of ferrites while maintaining the small size of GaAs MMIC technology.

Both these options, though superior to accelerated testing alone, have significant drawbacks. Correlating accelerated test data, with a small sample of real time data, still does not provide a high degree of statistical reliability. Real time testing requires a significant period of time to develop a statistically significant data base, usually a minimum of 5 years to calculate 7 to 10 year operational life in LEO.

SRM designers/analysis want to see processes that range from the normal case to the effects of defects, and in particular how closely reality parallels their computer models. Currently, the only feedback on the events occurring within the motor during a test fire is very indirect or nonexistent; such information derives from either strain gages or embedded thermocouples, the latter being very indirect or nonexistent; such information derives from either strain gages or embedded thermocouples, the latter being very expensive and requiring implementation during SRM component manufacture. An approach to provide data is Real Time X-Ray Computed Tomography. Real Time CT can provide transverse cross sectional images of the burning motor as a function of time. Cross-sectional images of density as a function of time are a major step forward, but the SRM engineer is more interested in longitudinal cross sectional images. With currently available CT technology, it is possible to obtain a series of contiguous transverse slices so that longitudinal scans are partly realized. Another approach involves cone-beam CT but this approach is far less mature. During Phase I, the contractor will determine the requirements of a CT system capable of providing real time longitudinal scans of a burning SRM, and shall design a system meeting those requirements. Some issues key to making longitudinal CT practical are: access to very high intensity x-ray sources; access to high speed x-ray detectors and corresponding circuitry for data acquisition; ability to configure a CT system to obtain the necessary data without unduly complicating the test procedure, fixturing, or safety provisions; cutting edge algorithm development that allows for reconstruction of images, particularly from incomplete data, cone beam CT, or a combination; and familiarity with SRM analysis requirements including an understanding of the density/strength implications of various materials, and an understanding of bond line problems.

One of the most suitable and reliable platforms from which such remote sensing objectives can be achieved is the low Earth orbiter. One of the most suitable and reliable platforms from which such remote sensing objectives can be achieved is the low Earth orbiter. Improved efficiency and accuracy in the deployment, operation, and versatility of such monitoring platforms will require new capabilities in space based navigation, tracking, and attitude control. Current operations rely on a panoply of ground tracking, attitude sensing, and navigational systems which by the nature of their diversity make it costly to integrate them and difficult to achieve an optimal synergism. As an alternative, much analysis and diversity make it costly to integrate them and difficult to achieve an optimal synergism. As an alternative, much analysis and several programs are in progress to exploit the Global Positioning System (GPS) of satellites to perform some of the navigation, tracking and attitude determination objectives for space vehicles. Receiver developments for space application currently build on conventional technology and methodology designed for Earth bound user systems and adapt this to the space environment. For example, the Miniature GPS Receiver chipset developed with funding from Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is a small, lightweight, and low power receiver suitable for manifesting on virtually and satellite, but it has only conventional navigation capabilities. There is a need to depart from conventional receiver architecture in order to address specifically unique operational frame of space, the dynamics of spacecraft, and the potential for high precision, real time, and multifunction application in navigation, tracking, and attitude control. The ability for one GPS receiver to perform the functions not only of a precise navigator, but also of orientation and pointing, normally accomplished by star trackers, or horizon and sun sensors, would translate into savings of weight, power consumption, integration costs, and computer requirements, in addition to potential improved operational accuracy. Therefore, non-conventional, innovative, and novel approaches are solicited for technological concepts and designs of GPS receivers to accomplish high precision spacecraft navigation, tracking, and attitude determination. Simple proposals include the following, but responses should consider going beyond these basic approaches: modifying the tracking loop bandwidth; providing output frequency in addition to delta phase; and exploiting multiple antenna configurations. Emphasis will be on measuring the GPS carrier signal, but utilization of the coded signals should be considered. All approaches should be oriented toward real time or near real time navigation/attitude control of spacecraft in 160 km to 10000 km altitude orbits and possible integration with on board inertial measurement units for autonomous application. Technological design should emphasize application accuracy, but package weight and power requirements figure significantly in the applicability to and success of space mission objectives.

Limiting the observations to cloud returns should allow simplification in hardware and signal processing and, it is hoped, easier adaptation to existing or planned space platforms. Work under this effort is to concentrate on simulation, sensitivity, and general hardware issues; other efforts currently under way will evaluate how data limited to cloud returns will apply to weather predication models.

While the expected effects can be estimated once a solar flare has been detected, flare onset is unpredictable with present telescopes, both because of image degradation caused by the earth’s atmosphere, and limitations of current solar vector magnetographs. One way to avoid the former limitation and to develop effective flare forecast methods is to make high resolution observations from space or near space. This could be accomplished with a balloon borne vector magnetograph, an instrument capable of mapping all three components of the solar magnetic field. Several flights of the magnetograph should lead to significant improvements in understanding solar flare physical processes and preflare signatures. The instrument should be capable of sub arc second spatial resolution with a magnetic sensitivity of 10 gauss in the line of sight component and 50-100 gauss in the transverse component. The instrumentation should also be capable of measuring the transverse flows that drive the magnetic field. Phase I of the effort is for design of a magnetograph, including a telescope of 90 to 120 cm aperture, that can be operated on a balloon borne gondola at 85,000 – 100,000 feet. To achieve the desired sensitivity the magnetograph must be able to detect partial circular and linear polarization at 250 parts per million over a field of view of at least 3 arc minutes. Spectral resolution must be better than 0.12 Angstrom, achieved, for example with a tunable band pass filter. Provision should be made for recording and storing or transmitting at least three magneto grams per hour for flights of 10 – 50 hours. The instrument must be able to make several flights per year, with minor refurbishment after each flight. Phase II of the effort is for construction and assembly of the magnetograph including the mechanical support structure and optics for the telescope and specialized optics and image detector . A fine pointer must be provided to stabilize the solar image to better than 0.05 arc second.

Water vapor in this region is important because of the effects it has on the absorption of infrared radiation and its effects on surveillance system. This payload would seek to quantify the levels of water vapor and variability as a function of altitude, and seasonal and latitudinal variability, between 15 and 90 kilometers. Other trace gases such as methane, Nox, and CFCs are also of interest because of their possible effects on atmospheric chemistry and climate. Also of interest is the possibility of detecting atomic oxygen, CO2 and NO in the region between 90 and 140 kilometers. The use of solid state lasers, detectors, and diode pumping should be strongly considered in the design of this system because of the limited power and weight capabilities of the anticipated Nike-Orion launch vehicle. If measurements of atomic oxygen, CO2, or NO appear feasible consideration to using a Black Brant vehicle, if require, will be given. Conventional Raman, differential absorption, and heterodyne lidar measurement techniques should be considered. Different system viewing geometries should be evaluated to maximize the system sensitivity. Use of eye safe wavelengths is not necessarily required. It is expected that the measurements will be performed during the descent portion of the flight. Once a design has been developed a comparative evaluation of its sensitivity with other existing sensors such as frost point hygrometers, spectrometers, radiometers, and cryogenic samplers will be performed. Tradeoffs between onboard data storage versus telemetered data should also be evaluated. Recovery and multiple launches of this lidar payload are planned.

However, the requirement to measure density above 75 km with current lidar systems has demanded a large receiver and/or a powerful transmitter and thus ruled out the use of a trailer platform. It is envisioned that new alterative lidar techniques with large backscatter cross-sections could be developed to overcome this limitation. Requirements for the lidar system are as follows: the receiver aperture to be used should have moderate dimensions, the transmitter laser should not require more space than is available in a 8 x 25 ft trailer, and density and temperature profiles in the region from 80 to 110 km should be specified to an uncertainty better than 10 percent for vertical smoothing of 3 km and a temporal resolution of 15 minutes.

The problem has received considerable theoretical study and has been the subject of field experiments using various dissipation schemes. To date, all amelioration efforts have had very limited success in terms of operational techniques for avoiding the closing down of airfields during dense fog episodes. The evaporation of airborne water droplets by directed infrared irradiation has been demonstrated in the laboratory environment. This proposal is to investigate the feasibility of transitioning the technology into an airfield environment, specifically, the energy needs and component requirements for an operational directed infrared energy fog dissipation system. The minimum capabilities of the DEFDS are to maintain runway visual range (RVR) of at least 400 m within the volumes of the approach, touchdown and roll out height x along runway length in meters. Phase I is a research effort to quantify the dimensions of the problem and to explore design options for DEFDS. Given present and forthcoming directed infrared energy hardware, the research must address the system architecture options, the energy requirements, the power levels, the fog characteristics, the wind conditions, costs, reliability, aircrew safety, aircraft safety, and environmental implications. The Phase I report must include all these considerations in addition to the general design specifications for DEFDS. Phase II is a developmental effort which requires the construction and demonstration of a prototype subscale DEFDS. Subscale means that the prototype DEFDS must maintain RVR > 400 m within an environment having RVR > 400 m. The volume to be so maintained will be commensurate with the employment of a single moderate power, commercially available directed energy device.

In addition, at 10 GHz, the electrical size of such sensors is becoming large enough to cause a significant perturbation of the field being measured. It is also quite possible for the field to couple to any conducting leads or cables that are present which can not only perturb the field but also introduce error into the voltage/current signal being carried on the conducting lead. There is a growing requirement for more precise diagnostic capability with an upper frequency carried on the conducting lead. There is a growing requirement for more precise diagnostic capability with an upper frequency response approaching 100 GHz to support planned testing activities in the mw/mmw frequency spectrum. Phase I: This effort will be directed toward identifying a physics principle which can be used as a basis for high frequency electromagnetic sensor operation. Several physics principles are used as the basis for existing electric/magnetic field sensors which can function for making measurements at frequencies as high as 20 GHz. This research is directed toward development of approaches, which directly measure the field magnitude, and not toward methods, which only detect the envelope of the field component. The principle to be applied could be previously or newly identified but would have to have supporting analysis, which would explain the operation of an EM sensor using it as a basis. The sensors to be developed should be capable of detecting a continuous wave field produced by radiating sources of 10-200 watts and should have a dynamic range of 60 dB. Pulse waveforms with one nanosecond rise times and one mill joule of energy in a high noise environment need to be detected. The sensor should be able to be placed inside a cube approximately 30 cm on a side without appreciably disturbing the field. The sensor should have a response bandwidth of one octave or more. They should be polarization sensitive with the ability to combine two to detect both polarizations. New sensor concepts proposed under this program do not need to satisfy all of the above requirements; significant improvements in any area will warrant serious interest. The effort should eventually lead to a demonstration by laboratory measurement(s) of the ability of the physics principle to function as an EM sensor. The potential sensor to be derived from a successful physics principle must be of such a nature that it is a candidate for practical operation in the field. The operating parameters required of a field operational sensor include small size, minimal perturbation of the field component to be measured, reasonable detecting/recording electronics and acceptable calibration procedures. Approaches, which require exotic very expensive materials or very cumbersome support equipment, are not likely to be acceptable. On the other hand, and principle which offers capability not currently available will be evaluated. The problem of transporting the signal from the sensor to the recording device with minimal perturbation must be addressed. Phase II: This effort will be directed toward the fabrication and test of a working model of a sensor and identification of problems associated with construction field worth models. Phase III: This effort would be directed toward the design of an operational sensor if the problems identified in Phase II can be resolved. The final step would be a demonstration of the functioning sensor and identification of any special operating procedures or constraints. Successful sensors developed under this program would find use in diagnostics performed under the Air Force Tactical Microwave Effects program and the SDI space system susceptibility testing program.

These applications, however, require sources which operate at high temperature and efficiently. Currently, there are several candidate material systems including compounds and alloys of the II-VI, III-V, and IV-VI families; the latter being the lead-salts. Each of these systems requires increased development of the materials technology for fabrication of suitable laser diodes. The lead-salts are a superior choice in the Auger recombination of free carriers, which detracts from efficient laser operation. There are several areas, however, in which further study is required to ultimately formulate an optimized laser design from which an appropriate device may be fabricated. These areas include: - Current substrates, upon which epitaxial active layers are grown, and are beset with large concentrations of defects. In addition, it is difficult to cut, polish and otherwise process lead salt materials without damage. - The materials have poor thermal conductivity and there have been instances of unstable interfaces and contacts. Thus, it has been difficult to successfully cycle lead salt devices. In addition, there are problems with the electrical conductivity of these materials including the effect of alloy scattering. - Differential quantum efficiencies of existing lead-salt diode lasers are rather low. Possible contributing factors include leakage currents and non-radiative free-carrier recombination at dislocations and interfaces. Phase I of this program is to conduct an analysis of current state of the art lead salt materials technology. This analysis should highlight the previously mentioned areas of concern and other possible deficiencies which may limit the ultimate performance of a lead salt laser diode device operating in the 3-5 micron wavelength range at or near 300k.

This excited state of oxygen is then used to both dissociate molecular iodine and collissionally excite the atomic iodine lasing species in oxygen-iodine lasers. Presently, singlet delta oxygen is produced in generators that operate at relatively low pressure though it has been produced at pressures up to 100 torr. It is suggested that if singlet delta oxygen can be effectively produced at much higher pressures, then the pumping requirement for chemical oxygen-iodine laser systems will be considerably reduced. Higher generator pressures would also allow for higher pressures in the oxygen-iodine laser cavity. Higher cavity pressures would have the added effect of forcing the oxygen-iodine laser to saturate homogenously. A homogeneously saturated laser would allow for efficient coupling to fiber optics used for potential remote applications of oxygen-iodine lasers. The goal of this effort is to determine the feasibility of producing steady flows of singlet delta at generator pressure approaching one-atmosphere and cavity pressures approaching 50 torr. Then, if feasible, the development of efficient, high-pressure, chemical oxygen iodine laser. The end product of Phase I will be a feasibility study of methods for high pressure singlet delta oxygen production, a design for a high pressure singlet delta oxygen generator and, if feasible, a design of a high pressure oxygen-iodine laser.

High Energy Density Rechargeable Batteries: The Air Force currently uses rechargeable lead acid batteries of conventional design for emergency power and high energy, lithium, primary batteries for long term survival power in Minuteman and Peacekeeper silos. In the future, these batteries may be replaced with improved rechargeable batteries if performance and cost can be enhanced. Significant performance parameters of the desired batteries include energy storage capacity of up to 10,000 amp hours for a 28 volt system, a minimum of 100 cycles over a ten to 15 year time period, minimum maintenance requirements, and a storage life of ten to 15 years under float charge if necessary. Additionally, high hardness of the battery for nuclear weapons environments is also desirable. During Phase I, anode, cathode, and electrolyte systems should be explored and cells of up to 100 amp hour should be tested. In Phase II, a 1000 amp hour cell should be demonstrated and battery designs provided that establish the feasibility of scale up to at least 4000 amp hours capacity. b. Bipolar Lead Acid Technology: Secondary battery systems offer advantages for systems which have long stand times but also require periodic operations in test cycling models. The lead acid battery offers high energy density, mature chemistry/material technology, and high cycling life. Basically, this battery capability incorporates over 100 years of product fine tuning. The bipolar construction offer improved power/energy density, and more rugged construction. Sealed operation projections indicate the bipolar construction offers smaller, more compact, battery design with a possibility of missile sized rechargeable units. Phase I of this effort would investigate designs of sealed bipolar lead acid batteries for two sizes of a USAF missile platform i.e., RV and decoy sized flight vehicles. Phase II would consist of the fabrication and testing of 40-50 test batteries in each of the two sizes design in Phase I. Ten units of each design would be delivered to BMO for independent evaluation. c. High Voltage Cathodes: Cathode couples for voltage cells operate in the range of 1.5-2.5 volts, although some proposed lithium based designs promise voltages approaching 4 volts. For operation as a battery vs. cell, a string of cells must generally be connected to achieve desired operating voltage levels. Concepts are sought which explore new cell cathode/electrolyte approaches which give a minimum of 4 volt. The objective is to investigate the design of a high power short lived battery capability where packaged minimum cell voltage ranges from 4-6 volts. Battery voltages desired for missile systems would range from 12-40 volts. Phase I will investigate designs of cathode/electrolyte chemistry offering a 4-6 volt cell in the packaged configuration. Designs must show battery capability of 10-40 amps over a 30 second discharge with 12-40 volts.

A vital component in such systems is the fiber optic cable connector used to join one optic cable segment to another. Serious power loss through the connector is frequency experienced after relatively few functional test cycles. Analysis has shown that the causes the power and/or attenuation losses are varied: 1. Input cable to connector mismatch 2. Improper preparation of the end of the input cable that interfaces with the connector: improper cut off; improper polishing cracked or split cable 3.

A need exists to enhance fiber optic cable connector design, producibility, manufacturability and functionality to a point that will insure extremely high reliability over a minimum of 10-30 operational cycles. The firing systems that relate to this SBIR solicitation requires each fiber optic cable, to handle 500-1000 millijoules of pulsed laser energy with an optical loss of less than 1.0 db per fiber through the connector.

Although this promise has remained largely unfulfilled, it has developed out of the realization that the variety of organic compounds with a wide range of both optical and electronic properties is unlimited, with several thousand compounds being readily available. In spite of these difficulties, considerable progress has been made in the last decade in realizing practical, active electronic and optoelectronic devices where an organic material forms an integral part of the device structure. One promising approach employs an organic film that is layered onto the surface of a conventional inorganic semiconductor substrate such as Si, GaAs, or InP to form an insulating or conducting layer that controls the distribution of electric fields and hence the transport of charge within the device. An attractive feature of such devices is that the composition of the organic film can be altered only slightly to effect large changes in its optical and electronic properties. Furthermore, the cohesive forces that bind molecules are somewhat soft and can be layered without inducing strain onto a variety of semiconductor substrates. Thus, the organic/inorganic semiconductor growth process need not be limited by the constraints of lattice matching.

Flying at high speeds, the HVV will be able to collect data at very high rates and will need a high bandwidth data link, e.g., a laser link to a satellite, which then relays the information to the ground. In order to support laser communications and the electro-optical sensors on board an HVV, an optical window must be developed. The window must be able to withstand the external stresses of hypervelocity flight, be transparent to the optical signals, and cause a minimum of distortion and attenuation. During Phase I, the contractor will formulate a test procedure to evaluate candidate designs for an optical wavelengths and data rates required. The contractor will analyze how the candidate windows distort the beam intensity, phase front, and direction. Since the external environment varies greatly over the surface of the aircraft, the window shape and location must be considered. In Phase II, the contractor will design, fabricate, and test at least three different window designs in a representative environment.

The interest continues in hope of producing DC pumped rare earth doped solid state lasers, optoelectronic applications for silica and non silica based fiber optics, impact devices and the possible use of rare earth doped devices for frequency standards. In recent years erbium doped silica fibers have been successfully applied toward the amplification of optical signals in transmission over long distances; applications of integrating the fibers with active elements on III-V semiconductors are being considered. Other possible applications are rare earth ion laser materials, optically pumped by heterojunction emission in the host m material; or materials demonstrating high ratios of inhomogeneous to homogeneous optical absorption line widths, permissibly at cryogenic temperatures, for persistent spectral hole burning memories and tunable filters. The key to many of the studies has been the proper incorporating of the rare earth ion into the semiconductor host and to excite the internal luminescence transition not only for optically, but also electrically. The preparation of pure semiconductors by doping with rare earths continues to be a problem. There is a need to develop the capability to grow thick and high concentration rare earth doped semiconductor layers such that fundamental experiments and device developments can be performed. Furthermore, for optoelectronic integration the growth technique necessitates good concerns, it is therefore advisable to consider growth of such structures by such methods as Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) or Metal organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE). Phase I research should explore the development of productive growth techniques for doping technologically important semiconductors such as Group III-V and silicon-based materials. The growth should demonstrate good control of growth parameters to allow for growing heterostructures and epitaxial layers with an overall thick total layer.

However, HSI issues and problems are not normally considered until late in the acquisition cycle when design changes are difficult and costly. The proposed computer program requires prototypical research in applying AI and fuzzy decision logic to develop an integrated approach for HSI analysis.

Develop an airborne monitoring system for pilot incapacitation. Numerous subsystems have been developed for physiologically monitoring pilots while they are flying. At least 18 pilots have lost consciousness, crashed their aircraft and died as a result of G-induced loss of consciousness, or G-LOC since 1982. Likewise, over 70 Air Force pilots have been killed during peacetime due to crashes related to spatial disorientation. The system, ideally should be noninvasive, one hundred percent accurate, and lightweight such that it can be retrofitted into aircraft with minimal cost and downtime. In Phase I all work that has been done to date on such incapacitation monitoring systems should be assimilated, investigated, and those that appear the most promising developed. In Phase II the system should be developed, tested on a centrifuge, and then flight tested. The end product will be a prototype airborne physiological monitoring system for pilot incapacitation. b. Develop an overall control system for the COMBAT EDGE equipment that can be interfaced with the aircraft’s 1553 mux buss, which would allow such systems as the Automated Missile Evasion System (AMES) to drive the pneumatic system controlling the OCMBAT EDGE ensemble. The Air Force is developing OCMBAT EDGE, a new acceleration protection system for pilots of high G aircraft. This system currently incorporates the standard anti-G valve in combination with an oxygen regulator in order to deliver both anti-G suit counter pressure jerkin/vest and positive pressure breathing air supplies. A digitally-based Breathed Regulator Anti-G (BRAG) valve has been developed for this system but not tested to date. It does not interface with the 1553 mux buss of the aircraft. Such a system would be programmable and tailored to each pilot’s G tolerance and comfort; by interfacing the system with the aircraft’s flight control system, evasive maneuvers could be anticipated by the system rather than just reacted to, as they are now. The COMBAT EDGE is programmed to have several preplanned product improvements over the next 5 years; such a digital control system could be developed in parallel with other improvements. Testing could be accomplished on the Dynamic Environment Simulator centrifuge of the Armstrong Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB OH. Phase I will investigate the feasibility of interfacing the system. The Phase II product will be a prototype digital breathing regulator anti-G valve for positive breathing ensembles such as COMBAT EDGE. c. Effective voice communications, crew safety, and human performance in acoustic environments mandate optimum utilization and matching of the human operators with their systems and subsystems. Emphasis is on establishment of natural, intuitive interfaces utilizing innate abilities and requiring no learning/training for efficient operation. Intuitive interfaces facilitate operator task performance, significantly reduce workload, minimize operator fatigue, and improve personal safety. Intuitive interface technologies are conceived and developed individually, proven, and integrated with other technologies for application to both specific and generic situations. The development of natural audio interface technologies as well as measurement metrics are critical elements in these enhancements efforts. Basic and applied research opportunities are numerous in the human interface technology areas because they are so frequently overlooked in developmental efforts. Human audio interface technologies include, but are not limited to the following: auditory systems modeling and neural networks for robust signal processing of the speech signal; digital audio technology to allow advanced auditory technologies such as 3D audio and interactive voice to be integrated into aircraft systems; voice communications countermeasures/counter countermeasures providing voice jamming and jam resistant technologies; noise exposure, hearing loss and sound protection principles, guidelines and devices; active noise reduction development and applications to personal equipment systems and to occupied areas; 3D auditory display development and applications to spatial awareness and communications; analytical and measurement methodologies and models. Phase I end products will prove the feasibility of recommended improvements to human audio interface technologies. Phase II end products are methodologies and hardware to reduce effects of noise and to enhance voice communications effectiveness.",651,4553,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65142/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65142/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:31:05,,,,,AF92-022_65142,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C1_AF92-022,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:14.109855+00

By capitalizing on the human judgment and the robot’s ability to operate in conditions lethal to humans, the advantages of each system can be exploited. Human operator awareness of the robot’s work environment adds significant flexibility to mission capability. The challenge is to develop quality feedback from robot to operator. There are two specific challenges: a. Fine manipulation using human sized robotic hands requires human sized exoskeletons for intuitive control. Force feedback to these small exoskeletons requires small volume, high efficiency, semi linear, actuator mechanisms. Actuators are needed to provide human range forces to exoskeleton systems used by operators of fine dexterous manipulators. Phase I will explore the feasibility of the concept. Phase II product could be miniaturized actuators; b. Sensor technology advances now yield exceptionally high resolution measurements. A key element in human controlled robots is to provide quality feedback without overwhelming the operator with excessive detail. The challenge is to define reasonable limits of information feedback to the operator. Successful completion may require reductions in sensor resolution, smaller matrices, or the reduction techniques. Phase I should explore test methods and criteria which need to be developed to verify and validate the Operator-Robot Interface sensory feedback specifications.

A requirement exists for development of a photocathode/focal plane array material sensitive to a greater portion of the near-infrared spectrum. Critical parameters include cost, spectral response, sensitivity, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio. Phase I will investigate approaches that consolidate the fusion of thermal and image intensification. Estimated size, weight, and cost of peripheral support equipment is critical to the advanced photocathode development strategy. A 25mm diameter cathode design is recommended as optimal. The minimum sensitivity requirement is 1000 micro-amps per lumen, and the minimum resolution must exceed the current Night Vision Goggles (NVG) specification of 36 line paris. The ultimate goal is to incorporate the advanced photocathode as the integral component that can replace the Aviator’s Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) third generation photocathode. Correct form, fit, and function would be ideal, but not required. A Phase II product would incorporate the advanced photocathode in a helmet-mounted night vision device to give the aviator increased spectral response, sensitivity, field of vision (FOV), and resolution. b. Miniature Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs) presently are used to inject computer-generated data and/or sensor-based imagery into helmet-mounted optical systems. The disadvantages with this technology are low brightness, limited contrast and resolution, length and weight, and high voltage requirements. An improved display device is desired which is capable of presenting alpha-numeric and continuous scene displays. The displayed image must be bright enough to be viewed against a bright field. Phase I will consist of a feasibility study, conceptual design, and preliminary performance analysis. The Phase II program will design, fabricate, and evaluate a prototype device. c. Design and demonstrate a helmet-mounted virtual image display. A virtual world employs an electronically generated all aspect virtual image display. A VID is similar to the aircraft mounted head-up display but mounted on the helmet so the information displayed is always within the viewer’s field of view. By taking into account the viewer’s line of sight, the VID becomes an interactive control/display system within a panoramic display. This new virtual interface system concept requires a helmet mounted VID that permits displaying superior graphics and pictorial information. This Phase I effort will design; using innovative hardware/technology, a helmet-mounted VID for supporting virtual Man-Machine Interface (MMI) research activities. Two monochromatic image sources are required in order to display a true 3D world. Whether monochromatic or color image sources are used, achromatized display optics will be required. Initially, the resolution requirements for the VID is video graphics adapter (VGA) compatible; eventually, the virtual environment will include high-resolution engineering workstation Computer Aided Design (CAD) graphics. The proposed VID display approach should have a plug-in capability for future image source improvement products and optics should be free of geometric distortions, pincushion, keystone, etc., so that pre-distortion of the input images is not required. The goal for field of view is 120 degree horizontal by 90 degree vertical with at least 40 degree stereo overlap region: the minimal requirement is 80 by 60 with at least 40 degree stereo overlap region. The system must be lightweight and sufficiently rigid to qualify for centrifuge usage as an out the window scene simulator. The Phase II will assemble three fully functional laboratory breadboards for performance verification.",533,3715,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65123/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65123/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:31:06,,,,,AF92-024_65123,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C1_AF92-024,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:14.109855+00

Flow resistance offered by current USAF aircraft oxygen systems limits the rate at which breathing gas is delivered to the crewmember. High breathing resistance adds work stress, discomfort and distraction to an already high workload, stressful, flight environment. High aspiratory resistance may produce reduced G-tolerance by reducing the effectiveness of anti-G respiratory maneuvers. It may also contribute to episodes of hypoxia and abnormal respiratory gas exchange. Identification of the flow resistance contributed by each of the component parts of currently deployed oxygen systems will enable us to identify the components which are the best candidates for redesign. Current systems fall short of meeting the standards set down by the Air Standardization Coordinating Committee for aircrew breathing systems. Suggested design changes and prototype low resistance components are needed to advance future development of these systems toward meeting these standards. Phase I efforts would identify the flow resistance in each of the components and suggest design changes for the components which are significant contributors to breathing resistance. Phase II would produce a brass board low-resistance breathing system, from the regulator to the coronial mask, for standard aircrew operations. b. Operations in both advanced, high altitude aircraft and in space have the potential for accidental human exposure to hypobaric environments in which the ambient pressure is less than the vapor pressure of water. Under such conditions the water in human tissues may vaporize, causing considerable expansion of the affected tissues. Body containment garments, in combination with positive pressure breathing systems, have been suggested as one possible means of protecting aircrew in these environments. Such a garment would be designed to passively restrict the swelling of enclosed tissues in the event of accidental depressurization. The envisioned garment, which would be incorporated into the aircrew clothing ensemble, should be lightweight, comfortable, and allow adequate freedom of movement.

Air Force bases are required by current laws and regulations to monitor base wells and aquifer systems for organic contamination. Current techniques involve collecting a sample and sending it to a laboratory for analysis. Time required for analysis as well as chemical changes and losses during this time period are of extreme concern. Possible instrumental systems that could be investigated include the following: Raman Spectroscopy, Forier Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer, Gas Chromatogram/Mass Spectrometer, and Liquid Chromatography, all possibly using some sort of fiber-optic sampling system. During Phase I develop a prototype instrument that has the capabilities to detect parts per billion contaminant levels of chlorinated solvents in potable waters and show its application to a field monitoring type utilization. In Phase II further develop this instrumentation into a portable, field type instrument that could be set up at a base well to monitor daily contaminant levels of chlorinated solvents. b. Current methodologies of environmental analyses for organic species, such as pesticides and herbicides, generate large volumes of hazardous waste solvents which have characteristics that make them hazardous cause storage and disposal problems, and cause potential exposure risks to analysis. Current approved technologies include extracting environmental samples with large amounts of organic solvents and concentrating the extracts into a small volume. For Phase I demonstrate viable alternate analysis techniques for pesticides and herbicides that drastically reduce the amount of waste solvents generated. Such techniques may employ some sort of solid phase extraction or special enclosed, low volume solvent extraction. During Phase II develop the best of those demonstrated methodologies and provide recommendations to appropriate federal agencies for approval of such methodologies as acceptable methods. c. Current techniques for identification of organic components in hazardous waste solutions is very time consuming. Analysis time of these complex samples becomes a problem when there are many samples to be analyzed. Bases can only legally store these wastes for a short period of time and need quick chemical analyses to characterize the waste before disposal.

This research will investigate and demonstrate the use of advanced computer-based interface and authoring technologies to support the design, development and delivery of instruction. Within this topic we invite proposals which address one of the following areas: a. Enhanced Human/Computer Interfaces for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Poor design of user-friendly interfaces seems to be a limiting factor in many of today’s computer based training aids. Recent advances in human computer interaction (HCI) technology provide a variety of approaches to the design of input/output mediums in software and hardware development. Digital video interactive displays, touch-sensitive input screens, speech synthesis, speech recognition, virtual world interfaces and many other interactive display concepts can have a significant impact within the ITS environment. Phase I, therefore, should cover the specification, design, and implementation of a proof-of-concept ITS built in an Air Force domain which takes advantage of these advanced human interface and display technologies. Programming language should be ADA. Phase II will extend the existing range of the prototype Its and extract from the design experience a methodology and toolset for rapid integration into any software/hardware compatible ITS for potential dynamic training applications. b. Digital Video Interactive (DVI) Technology. More so than ever before DVI technology makes possible affordable technical training that is both scenario and simulation based. This capability should contribute to greater efficiency in the production and delivery of courseware for computer based instruction (CBI). Additionally, DVI technology should aid in increasing learner comprehension as well as retention and transfer of learning to the work place. This research is to design, develop and evaluate a DVI based work environment for CBI authoring. The work environment may comprise single or multiple work stations for graphical, textual, and video productions. Phase I will produce the concept and functional characteristics of the work environment. Phase II will involve actual construction and testing of the multimedia DVI work environment. c. Automated Guidance for Designing, Developing and Delivering Computer based Training (CBT) Courseware. As computer hardware and software have become more sophisticated, designing and developing effective courseware has become an increasingly complex problem. An automated tool which has the capability to incorporate existing theories of instruction, learning, and knowledge into instructional strategy designs is desired. The environment should be capable of guiding novice instructional designers through the process of developing instruction prescribed by the particular instructional strategies.

The CALS goal is the application of computer technology to the creation, management, and use of technical data from weapon system concept, through design, manufacture, operational use, and logistics support, to retirement and disposal. Emphasis on CALS technology development has accelerated, but technology alone will not achieve the CALS vision. Ultimately, any such technology must be successfully incorporated into and accepted by the organization it is designed to serve. This transition has proven notoriously difficult and has often resulted in unintended organizational and human consequences. Thus, there is a pressing need for knowledge based strategies for inserting advanced technologies into existing organizations and for predicting the effects, both negative and positive. CALS implementation via Air Force Logistics Centers (ALCs) and System Program Offices (SPOs) represents a timely opportunity for addressing this widely recognized problem. Relevant considerations would include possible cultural and organizational barriers to CALS implementation in ALCs and SPOs, strategic alternatives for overcoming such barriers, and projected net efforts of a recommended strategy on productivity and other organizational consequences. Phase I requires investigation to define the nature and scope of the problem, identify promising solution strategies, and propose an approach for evaluating such strategies. Phase II requires execution of research proposed and development of a solution incorporating the above relevant considerations. There would be products resulting from Phase II: a.

Thus when a second beam impinges on the back side, the percent reflected depends upon the intensity of the input beam at that corresponding location. However, these devices are not capable of performing real-time pre-processing of input images for operations such as edge enhancement, or noise suppression. To overcome this limitation, simple circuit elements can be added to the focal plane. However, to successfully perform the intended operations for a broad class of input images and signal to noise variations, some means of real time pixel by pixel control of electronic gain and thresholding is needed. This control can be provided optically if auxiliary detectors are added to each pixel. Quadrant detectors are one example that work well. In order to illuminate each of these detectors with minimum optical crosstalk, some form of optical signal spatial separation, for example a lens array, must be permanently integrated onto the chip. Such an integrated opto-electronic focal plane processing chip would revolutionize optical signal processing and optical computing and can be realized by combining existing technologies, specifically OASLMs, VLSI and microlens array technology.

An order of magnitude of purification must be achieved in order to render phosphorus as purse as the arsenic sources available for GaAs technology. Silicon and sulfur must be eliminated from phosphorus source materials.

Antenna test ranges often contain objects that scatter or reflect UHF/SHF waves from the transmitting antenna into the receiving antenna, thereby creating a multipath channel. Very large measurement errors of low side lobe regions can result from this multipath propagation. Development of a system to operate in real time with antennas under test on an azimuthal/elevation pedestal to suppress indirect components and permit accurate pattern measurements is required. The system should utilize a reasonably small bandwidth and be able to suppress multipath by 20dB to 40dB in real time for a 100 wavelength antenna that is mounted on a pedestal rotating at an azimuthal rate of up to 30 degrees per second. This system is to operate without any additional antennas and without modification to the antenna positioner. It will display and record in real time the time delay and amplitude of each multipath component for every orientation of the antenna under test. Goals for multipath measurement accuracy are plus or minus 1 nanosecond for time delay and 0.2dB for amplitude.

Furthermore, if the network is allowed to continually monitor the antenna’s input settings and output radiation and re-train when inconsistencies occur, the neural network should be capable of re-learning the behavior of a degraded antenna and using this new behavior to optimize the antenna’s remaining performance capabilities.

They are required in imaging systems to remove distortions caused by the atmosphere. They are required in laser propagation to insure a good quality beam is transmitted through the atmosphere. The design of these systems uses many, perhaps well over a hundred, actuators which dynamically shape a mirror surface to compensate for the atmosphere. These actuators require an equal number of control loops to maintain their position. Further, these control loops are coupled to each other due to the mathematical equations used in the loops and due to the mechanical coupling of the mirror surface. The area of multiple-input-multiple-output control theory is directly applicable to this hardware implementation. The techniques of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) have been developed to help designers evaluate the design of a MIMO system. The problem is that techniques to systematically test this type of system have not been developed. The Bode Plot has been the most used tool of single input single output (SISO) control design and testing for the last 40 years. However, this approach is not feasible for testing large MIMO systems for two reasons: it takes too much to implement and run hundreds of simple tests, and the Bode plot does not yield stability measures for coupled MIMO systems. The need is to develop testing techniques and testing hardware that can be used toe valuate an adaptive optics systems. The solution must develop performance measures and stability measures that unambiguously describe MIMO system performance. Phase I will demonstrate that the contractor completely understands the techniques necessary to measure stability and performance of a MIMO system, specifically an adaptive optics system. The contractor will use simulation tools to show that a math model of a system can be tested and evaluated using the contractor’s proposed techniques. The contractor should be able to conceptually describe the required testing hardware and demonstrate the performance and stability tools a the end of Phase I. Phase II will build a MIMO system in hardware and built the testing hardware to demonstrate the performance of the system. An adaptive optics system can be reasonably demonstrated with a beam, or plate, to represent the mirror, with small piezoelectric actuators, to represent the mirror actuators, ad with displacement probes, to represent the wave front sensors used in adaptive optics system. The contractor shall then design and build the test hardware to fully characterize this surrogate system.

Typically, simply diode lasers are cleaved-facet, edge-emitting devices in which the coherent output power is limited by gain stripe width and catastrophic facet damage. Advanced structures, such as grating surface emitters, both distributed feedback and distributed Bragg reflector on-chip unstable resonators; non-regenerative diodes in external resonant cavities; master oscillator/power amplifier configurations; and antiguided, leaky, wave arrays have led to increased coherent output power by avoiding high intensities on device facets and/or coherently coupling several lower power emitters together into a single, high power beam. Basic diode laser structures are also being developed to emit in the 2-5 micron range utilizing materials. Although excellent results have been achieved, it is readily apparent that the potential utility of these mid-IR sources for Air Force applications will be greatly enhanced via the development of advanced laser structures. Phase I of this effort shall study the implementation of advanced diode laser structures in mid-IR materials. Study of new and innovative structures, in addition to those mentioned above, which address the dual requirements of high power and good beam quality, is highly encouraged.

As a result designers have failed to fully explore the superior material properties that are available using composites. This is due in part to the cost and complexity of conventional composite manufacturing techniques. Greater use of composite materials is needed to enable more ambitious missions to be undertaken, all of which require large, precision-built, space structures. A reduction in overall structural component weight would realize significant launch cost savings in this area. Pultrusion is a low cost automated manufacturing technique capable of producing constant high quality cross-section structures.

Presently, the body of data available on cell failure mechanisms is very limited. Understanding of cell failure mechanisms could lead to more robust cell designs. The Phase I effort will be to engineer and construct a prototype secondary solid state lithium polymer electrolyte cell, of sufficiently consistent morphology, such that reproducible energy density, power density and voltage characteristics are achievable. Based on the evaluation and testing of these prototype cells, any other cell criteria which can be optimized to yield a more robust design, as well as enhanced cell performance, should be defined. During Phase II based on knowledge obtained from Phase I studies, the contractor will engineer and construct a bipolar secondary cell that incorporates these new improved characteristics. This cell should exceed the typical performance values for bipolar secondary hi-polymer electrolyte cells. The contractor will test and evaluate the performance of the bipolar secondary cells. All designs, engineering criteria and performance testing results will be delivered to the USAF.",261,1729,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/64748/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/64748/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:31:26,,,,,AF92-078_64748,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C1_AF92-078,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:14.109855+00

Current methods of suppressing such instabilities through the addition of baffles and acoustic cavities, require time consuming empirical cut and try procedures, and design compromises. New and create approaches for controlling and eliminating combustion instability in liquid rocket engines are sought. The following examples are presented to stimulate ideas and are not meant to be limiting in their scope. In solid rocket motors, certain types of instabilities can be suppressed by the addition of small amounts of additives. The use of fuel or oxidizer additives in liquid rocket engines to control instability does not appear to have been explored. A creative and innovative search for compounds which can favorably alter the combustion of liquid propellants is warranted at this time. Since spray and pressure should have significant effect on the combustion process. In addition, other compounds may play a favorable role similar to that of tetraethyl lead antiknock suppression in internal combustion engines. Active control is currently used or considered for a number of combustion applications to impact both performance and stability. Active control of the injection/atomization process should provide new avenues to explore in the quest for improved liquid rocket engine stability. During the Phase I effort, the feasibility of potential approaches would be examined and an experimental procedure for demonstrating their effectiveness would be conceived and designed. In the Phase Ii effort, laboratory scale tests would be conducted to explore the effectiveness of proposed approaches. The effect of promising suppression techniques on engine and system performance would be examined to ensure there were no deleterious effects. Reliability and maintainability issues would be considered at the propulsion system level. Cost effectiveness would also be addressed.

Two 100 ft. x 135 ft. off axis parabolic reflectors will concentrate solar energy into a thrust cavity, located at the two reflectors’ focal point. Mis-focused solar energy is normally the reason that an optimum ratio cannot be achieved. When this occurs, the mis-focused energy spills out of the thruster cavity and either is lost, bounces off unprotected materials and equipment, or is absorbed/often with destructive results. The focus of this project is to develop a subscale, secondary solar concentrator which will maximize the system concentration ratio, given a primary concentrator size; while minimizing the secondary concentrator mass, it will still have a significant impact on the guidance and control systems. A prime, space environment requirement for the secondary concentrator demands design simplicity and manufacturing ease to interface with the total solar concentrator-thruster concept. The Phase I project will be used to determine the most suitable candidate concept for further development and a preliminary design of the chosen concept. Phase II of the project will consist of a preliminary design, a detailed design, and the fabrication of a small scale dimensional version; which will fit into or onto the rhenium tube cavity thruster and in front of the fluxmapper system.

Space debris levels are continuing to increase with each new space launch and with collisions between existing debris. This is of particular concern at certain favored low earth orbits which are used by defense satellites and the shuttle. Extensive passive optical and radar measurements are being made, but these are not particularly sensitive to debris of smaller sizes. Even very small millimeter size debris can be extremely damaging at orbital velocities, as demonstrated by the pitting of the shuttle view ports. In-situ measurements of space debris are sought by using the proposed lidar system to obtain statistically useful data to help validate current space debris models. The Phase I effort will be to study the feasibility of the concept given the current and expected, near-term, state-of-the-art, lidar technology. The Phase Ii effort, if awarded, will seek to develop sensor designs which may meet the proposed objectives, identify specific required key technologies, and identify and address high risk factors through further study and/or development. The fabrication of a scale brass board system leading to the final design of the space qualifiable hardware for launch will be considered. Candidate approaches should consider use of compact, solid state, laser transmitters utilizing efficient laser diode pumping. Tradeoff studies of the merits of using different detection schemes such as coherent, incoherent, quadrant detectors, or focal plane arrays should be done.

The backscatter contains neutral density particle and aerosol information as a function of range from the lidar system. Lidar systems operate at any number of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths, and either stare to record the temporal behavior of the atmosphere as it passes or rapidly scan a region to obtain an atmospheric snapshot. Scanning or staring systems, especially those operating at nonvisible wavelengths, are not well suited to locate and track targets or atmospheric features which subtend relatively small solid angles as viewed from the lidar system.

Such a development would provide a means for triggering and investigating a new realm of plasma phenomena predicted by theory. These include the creation of dense columns of free electrons and positive ions in the ionosphere, lower mesosphere and upper stratosphere, which could scatter electromagnetic radiation. Such a capability could lead to the development of new diagnostic techniques to investigate ionospheric properties such as electron attachment, recombination, and diffusion times; winds and shears in the lower ionosphere and upper atmosphere; and the determination of atmospheric constituents and pollutants, including their relative concentrations.

Errors in thermospheric density models at altitudes of 90 to 1000 km are believed to be the cause of this problem. Currently available computer-efficient models are of two types: spherical harmonic models such as Hedin’s MSIS and Killeen’s VSH; and static diffusion models such as those developed by Jacchia and Slowey, which employ analytic approximations. The VSH model, which is derived by fitting spherical harmonics to the output of a first principles Thermospheric Ionospheric General Circulation Model, provides horizontal winds in addition to density and composition. An empirical model of neutral winds has also been developed by Hedin using techniques employed in the MSIS model. The main difficulty with first-principles models and fast models derived from them is that they require knowledge of all the sources and sinks of energy, some of which are rarely measured or unknown. For example, the Thermospheric Ionospheric General Circulation Model and the VSH model lack the semiannual variation, though it has been in empirical models for 30 years. Empirical models have the ability to fit the actual data. We solicit innovative thermospheric models which possess improved accuracy and speed and are suitable for use on digital computers.

As a result, strategic guidance and navigation systems relying solely on inertial instruments for navigation are difficult to acquire, maintain, and service.

New concepts for mapping or imaging mass and electron densities of turbulent flow field boundary layers remains a challenge for acquiring a database to explore RF degradation under these conditions. Laminar flow fields physics has explored non-turbulent flows with much success. With advances being made in maneuvering reentry vehicles, a through understanding of this phenomenology is required for improving communications and guidance. Much of the ground testing of this phenomena takes place in shock tunnels with short experimental durations which calls for time resolved diagnostics. Survivability or low cost repeatability in a shock tunnel environment is necessary for acquiring data over a series of ground tests. Ideally, a 3D time resolved tool would provide an in depth understanding of turbulent boundary layer conditions. Phase I should investigate one or more advanced diagnostics or innovative concepts and include technical feasibility and performance improvement analysis. Phase II should consist of actual data acquisition and mapping of models at ground test facilities. b. Turbulent flow during reentry produces modulation of the plasma produced in the boundary layer of the hypersonic vehicle. This plasma modulation can degrade the ability to perform target finding missions, perform a position update or even communicate due to decorrelation of the microwave signals. The degree of plasma modulation and the spectral content of such modulation during turbulent boundary layer flow needs to be investigated. Additionally, the effect that this plasma modulation has on electromagnetic transmission over the frequency bands from S- to Ka band should be addressed. Phase I would determine the feasibility of the effort and Phase II would develop the analytic techniques necessary. c. A number of both flight and ground tests have been done over the years to measure the plasma conditions during reentry and to address electromagnetic transmission through this plasma. However, in a number of cases these data have not been thoroughly analyzed to determine all of the elements necessary to compare these data with flow field/plasma models. This data base needs to be analyzed in depth and sufficient information obtained to validate existing state of the art flow field codes.

Although reserve lithium thinly chloride batteries offer very high energy densities, safety and reliability have become significant issues. The advantages provided by high rate reserve lithium batteries are often negated by additional safety and operational concerns. For example, a requirement for effluent gas containment and neutralization is necessary to protect missile assets during abort. In addition the traditional approach has been the use of a centralized instrumentation power supply, either reserve or manually activated. This has stimulated the development of progressively higher energy density batteries to meet this requirement. Since power has been consolidated in a central supply, safety and reliability can become an issue, especially for high energy density lithium battery systems. One approach is to develop high energy silver-zinc batteries. Another approach to mitigating these concerns is to provide instrumentation power via smaller, lower power, dispersed primary batteries. Each component in such an instrumentation and telemetry system would contain its own primary power supply and cabling. The use of primary batteries would simplify functional testing and reduce safety and reliability concerns relative to the centralized power system. Silver zing batteries have many advantages over lithium batteries such as high reliability, prior successful use in other strategic missile applications, and reduced safety concerns. Improvements in current state of the art silver zinc technology would allow increased energy density and improved voltage regulation which would therefore make the technology more viable for strategic missile applications.

Over the last few years, much effort has been expended on technical efforts which address better ways to perform these functions. These development efforts have met with varying levels of success. Technical deficiencies still exist in the areas of Kalman filter robustness and navigation system fault detection and isolation. Enhancing the performance of these functions would result in improved consistency of the navigation solution, better enabling combat aircraft to successfully complete missions even under instrument meteorological conditions. Proven benefits of neural network technology suggest that this field may prove beneficial for improving the performance levels of these navigation/reference system functions. Among these advantages are the capability to detect and adapt to new classes of failure signatures, the capability to exploit massively parallel computing architectures, the ability to recall information based on content, and the ability to generalize from previous examples. Thus, this study will focus on applying neural network technology to such integrated navigation system functions as Kalma filter related diagnoses, fault detection, isolation and compensation for individual sensor failures, discrepancies, and degradation as well as system level failure/degradation detection. The emphasis of this program will be to assess the feasibility of applying neural network technology to perform navigation system integration, management, and diagnostic functions within a combat aircraft multisensor navigation suite. The PENANT program is to achieve statistically significant improvements in the consistency of the reference solution. The safety of flight goal is less than or equal to 1.3 aircraft losses per 100,000 flight hours due to integrated reference system failures. This goal is based upon a review of the current state of the art as represented by the F-16 system wide integrity monitoring analysis of outer loop flight control. Phase I of this program will consist of an assessment of neural network approaches, the strengths and weaknesses of each, and an examination of all levels of functionality within an advanced multisensor navigation suite. The purpose is to select representative navigation system functions which show the most potential for improved consistency/reliability if performed by neural network methods. Function will be selected for application of neural network and comparison with traditional techniques. Phase II will consist of in depth analysis of the selected functions, the identification of appropriate neural network techniques, the development and training of the identified neural network, and evaluation of the capability of the neural network to perform the selected function.

These broad system goals are achievable only when sensor observations are available from which to create a unified picture of object position and identity. This estimation process, called multisensor data fusion, leads ultimately to an accurate situation assessment. A sensor management function is present to automatically coordinate and prioritize requests for sensor service from the various system components. Also, the sensor manager must allocate the sensor service load to produce the best observations possible while dealing with problems like these: time varying demands for service, objectives that change with mission phase and unpredictable enemy actions, overlapping sensor capabilities, restricted emission regions, and variable sensor performance arising from physical randomness and perhaps enemy countermeasures. The interaction of the forward multisensor fusion process and the controlling sensor management function constitutes important feedback loop within this system. Phase I will examine the viability and structure of various formal or semiformal mathematical techniques that could satisfy the sensor management function in the feedback process just described. Semiformal structures are those that permit some very limited heuristic or symbolic processes as part of the overall algorithm. However, the emphasis of this effort is on formal numeric methods and the extent to which they can be applied.

These aircraft may employ low observable technologies, advanced launch and leave missiles, and face LO threats which dictate fire control radar designs that may require multiple, integrated, ESA or even conformal radar architectures. A critical and pacing ingredient of these advanced architectures will be the need for side coverage, which due to aircraft installation considerations, may result in a relatively small planar or conformal aperture to supplement the primary forward looking aperture. Attainment of significant detection and tracking ranges, in difficult ECM and ground clutter interference environments, will be technically challenging. First, the low resolution radiation pattern of the small side aperture, together with the large side hemisphere Doppler frequency gradients, will result in main beam clutter spreads that create large target blind velocity intervals. Second, the side array power/aperture product necessary to search extensive solid angular sectors at the required ranges will be difficult to achieve. The pulse compression techniques, used to obtain high average power with low peak power X-band transmit/receive module active arrays, can yield excessive eclipsing losses and large target blind range intervals. These blind velocities and ranges combine, via multiple pulse repetition frequency waveforms, to form a composite range Doppler blind zone map that may be substantially less than the desired 100 percent clear. Third, the all aspect medium PRF look down waveform results in the presence of directly competing diffuse side lobe clutter, which can readily mask small missile and low radar cross section threats. Fourth, significant reduction in threat RCS will result in a corresponding reduction in target signal to side lobe jammer ratios unless adaptive side lobe cancellation is employed. And finally, the presence of side lobe clutter can greatly degrade the performance of conventional ASLCs, and conversely, ASLC operation will serve to raise the antenna side lobe levels thus further aggravating the side lobe clutter problem. With the tremendous increases occurring in digital signal processing technology, sophisticated airborne radar adaptive processing is rapidly becoming practical and affords the potential of solving the above technical challenges. The Phase I activity will systematically investigate exploiting space time adaptive processing radar architectures for mitigation of the limited aperture/main beam clutter spread, reduced range-Doppler map visibility, side lobe diffuse and discrete ground rejection, and joint ECM/clutter interference suppression problems. The scope of the effort includes formulating and evaluating novel side array manifolding schemes that, in conjunction with innovative receiver channelization concepts, offer the potential for a practical implementation. The Phase I output will consist of a STAP algorithm design, radar architecture definition, and digital computer simulation performance predictions including on aircraft effects. The Phase II effort will demonstrate an in house STAP jammer, and main and side lobe clutter mitigation in near real time. Some breadboard digital array signal processors and appropriate radar receiver/antenna hardware/emulations and tactical environment simulations will be used. Phase III will provide the contractor with the ability to commercialize this adaptive signal processing to other DOD applications.

Although some researchers have investigated a few other discrete wavelengths for laser radars, no one has ever demonstrated a laser radar with the ability to tune continuously over any appreciable wavelength region. The ability to tune in wavelength would greatly enhance a coherent laser radar’s ability to exploit target signatures. In addition, a tunable laser radar could be used to build other types of useful sensors, such as a sensor to detect almost any type of vapor or aerosol. The critical technological challenge to building a tunable coherent laser radar is the availability of a source capable of generating a tunable single frequency output. The state of the art in OPOs is now advanced enough to consider developing one as a practical tunable source for a coherent laser radar. We wave selected the 1.5 to 5 micron region because the atmosphere is quite transparent throughout this region. There is a large existing body of passive sensors and research in this region which we can use to calibrate and compare with our measurements, and laser radiation in the region is relatively safe for exposure to human eyes which greatly simplifies testing. Phase I will focus on the design of the OPO and experimental work to validate the design.

Second, the requirements of the devices being evaluated had only minor reliance upon high fidelity of antenna effect simulation for effective performance. Next, the accuracy of signal modulators was a limiting factor on implementations. Finally, the cost of high-speed digital microwave signal modulators was a prohibitive constraint for most organizations. Recent designs of EW systems have incorporated antenna effects as more central elements to system performance. A notable example is the development of antiradiation missiles which use amplitude and phase antenna pattern effects to generate tracking error signals.

Any differences in discrete warning receiver performance between clean laboratory generated signal and actual emitters could be remedied relatively quickly during flight testing. Modern signal environments, however, are significantly denser and more complex. This drives receiver developers to explore faster and more robust methods to sort and identify signals. This is done by using more subtle characteristics of signal waveforms such as pulse shape and unintentional frequency variations that occur with different microwave oscillators and amplifiers. Complexity of the newer EW system designs also serves to drive the need for more realistic laboratory testing.

The intent of Phase I is to create engineering techniques for development and fielding of equipment which can be trusted to deliver both high instantaneous and high sustained performance without attention. Techniques are desired to develop replacements for existing components and subsystems; for complete new subsystems; for conceptual and computational engineering tools for design, development and trade off analyses; for conceptual and computational tools which can be used to calculate and demonstrate the value of PAS in terms of: vehicle mission effectiveness, group mission effectiveness, deployment response time, peacetime, and wartime costs, etc. Note that construction of a complete avionics suite is likely a job suitable for a large prime contractor but scores of smaller efforts are required to build the technology base which makes PAS possible. Efforts under this program will be to develop the techniques for adequately specifying and verifying sustained performance and the development of practicable PAS warranty requirements, measures, and remedies.

Experience with gas source based epitaxial techniques has demonstrated the utility of carbon as a source of acceptor atoms. Carbon has been found to resist migration during growth of semiconductor materials unlike other candidate dopants such as beryllium. At present, these carbon doping methods are typically based upon organometallic compounds, which introduce the additional complication of large quantities of unwanted gases, and are as such, not directly applicable to solid source MBE. This program seeks a source of carbon, which can be introduced at high concentrations in a conventional MBE environment.

State of the art microelectronic fabrication technology has advanced to the point where devices with submicron dimensions are a reality.

The detection and modeling of corrosion would help the Air Force to maximize the structural safety of its aircraft and keep maintenance costs to a minimum. Corrosion can go undetected in the hidden areas of an aircraft structure for years while it initiates and propagates structural damage. Although programs are in place to reduce corrosion, it will never be eliminated. Currently, there is no sensor that reliably detects the onset of corrosion. The detection and treatment of corrosion before it creates major structural damage would save the Air Force a significant amount of money and maintenance man-hours. The structural integrity of aging aircraft is of major concern in both the commercial and military sectors. An accurate fatigue life analysis is necessary to ensure the structural integrity of aging aircraft. Analytical deficiencies currently exist primarily due to the inability to account for the effects of corrosion on the fatigue behavior of aging aircraft. Corrosion effects each fatigue phase in the total structural life of a component. For example, fatigue crack growth behavior is influenced not only be the presence of a corrosive environment at the crack tip, but also by the presence of corrosion in front of the crack tip which causes accelerated growth. Corrosion particularly influences the total fatigue life when multiple site damage is present. It is necessary to obtain a fundamental understanding of the fatigue phenomena in the presence of corrosion to preclude the occurrence of excessive structural problems in aging aircraft.

A recent trend in aircraft avionics is the use of Common Processing Modules to simplify maintenance, reduce spare parts requirements, and lower system life cycle costs. Common modules have not been proven practical for flight control because of the myriad of I/O interfaces currently required for flight critical systems. However, advances in Digital Signal Processing technology are enabling the development of flexible and programmable I/O interfaces not previously possible. DSP software can replace complex analog circuit designs and allow a DSP module to replace a variety of specialized I/O modules. This makes possible a common I/O modules. Phase I will examine flight control sensor and actuator interface requirements and will investigate the applicability of DSP technology towards creating common I/O modules. A design of an adaptable common I/O module will result. Phase II will develop a laboratory brass board to demonstrate the ability to interface with typical flight control sensors and to adapt to changing interface requirements. Phase III would extend the ability to interface various I/O devices, as well as the capability for adapting to changing interface requirements. This capability would significantly simplify the implementation of System management techniques.",248,1722,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65026/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65026/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:31:41,,,,,AF92-119_65026,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C1_AF92-119,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:14.826234+00

Intrinsically, optical fibers provide a smaller target than most electrical cabling. With the smaller size, fibers can be routed to take advantage of structural shielding. But to increase the protection, it may be feasible to embed the fibers in fuselage and wing skins. Optical fibers have also been demonstrated at a laboratory level for their ability to be embedded into glass and carbon-carbon composites, cast aluminum, and cast titanium. In the future, embedded fiber could be feasible in sheet aluminum, fiber-reinforced metal matrix composites, and aluminum/composite laminates. The embedding techniques need evaluation to determine the positive of negative battle damage effects. Fiber optics are inherently immune to electromagnetic threats. Their employment is the optimum solution to EM vulnerability of flight control systems. Ballistic threats cause the major source of vulnerability to fiber optic systems. With electric cabling, a certain amount of damage can be sustained, causing an impedance mismatch, but data communication can still occur. With optical fiber, the damage usually results in fractures, shutting off data communication. So, in comparison to electric cabling, fiber is more vulnerable to shell fragmentation due to its fragility. But since optical fiber is smaller than electric cabling, protective techniques such as embedding in skins and structural shielding become more feasible. The approach is to investigate the favorable characteristics of fiber optics that will reduce the flight control system vulnerability and to develop techniques to provide protection to distributed optical data busses. Phase I will examine techniques to enhance the survivability of the fiber-optic data bus. These techniques will include structural shielding, adhesion, lamination, and embedding optical fibers to minimize their susceptibility. This phase will examine the state of the art technologies in fiber embedding/adhesion and evaluate them for applicability. This phase will examine the state of the art technologies in fiber embedding/adhesion and evaluate them for applicability. The most promising technologies will be combined into a viable set of protection techniques: technology maturity issues, structural issues, manufacturing issues, and maintenance/repair issues. Phase II will gauge the relative merit of the techniques by using test evaluation. Samples of the promising techniques will be fabricated. To optimize the test and evaluation, a test plan will be prepared for each sample. The ballistic, fragmentation, and fire testing will be done, evaluated and compared to a survivability assessment. Phase III would extend the survivability concepts demonstrated to increase the reliability of electronically directed systems.

The older metallic aircraft have serious problems with fatigue cracks due to fatigue and corrosion. Current Air Force Damage Tolerance Design Methodology requires that an aircraft be designed with assumed initial flaws. These assumed flaws, coupled with knowledge about the aircraft’s flight history, help set conservative inspection intervals. Inspections that are manpower intense, decrease the operational readiness of an aircraft and can result in damage where none existed previously. Newer aircraft using composites are over designed to compensate for scatter in material properties and possible undetected delaminations. Consequently, the benefits to be achieved through weight reduction are not as great as first expected. As with metallic components, they also have to be inspected periodically for damage. Metallic and composite structures would benefit from the strategic placement of fatigue crack, corrosion, and delamination sensors. These sensors would not only reduce the frequency of required inspections but also reduce the aircraft downtime required for the inspections.

Active magnetic bearings represent an innovative approach to aircraft engine rotor support with the potential of providing significant benefits not possible with conventional rolling element bearings. The successful application of magnetic bearings would result in engines with no oiling systems, high rotor speeds, reduced blade tip and seal clearances, reduced weight, and enhanced rotor dynamic control. However, technology for advanced, fail-safe auxiliary bearings has been identified as a critical factor in successfully achieving an operational aircraft engine magnetic bearing system. In an aircraft engine configuration wherein the primary support for the main shaft rotor is provided by an active magnetic bearing system, the auxiliary bearings would serve as a fail safe support mechanism. The unalleviated rotor will be statically supported by the auxiliary bearings. Additionally, in t he event of a power failure in the magnetic bearing control circuit or during excessive bearing loading conditions caused by the loss of turbine or compressor blades or due to a severe aircraft maneuver, the selected auxiliary bearings must be capable of withstanding these high loads so as to prevent contact between the magnetic bearing rotor and stator. The auxiliary bearings, under these conditions, must have sufficient life to enable the pilot to fly his aircraft safely to the nearest airbase.

The typical aircraft, so equipped, will now have a smaller number of individual instruments in the cockpit than required in the era of the old, dedicated analog, needle and dial instruments. However, controlling the luminance of these new multifunction instruments, under all operational conditions and flight maneuvering possibilities, becomes significantly more complex. This is because the legibility threshold of these displays under the very broad range of cockpit ambient light conditions must now be dealt with on an individual display basis. Not only must the fidelity of portrayed alphanumerics, graphics and video be preserved, but also intended color and grey shades must be maintained under the changing ambient.

The Phase I effort will include the development of a technique/methodology, a definition of the sensors and the electronics required to accomplish the desired results automatically, and a basic demonstration of the concept. This effort should consider various aspects: - The control of display instrument brightness over the range of 0.01 to 10,000 ft. lamberts with a sufficient number of gradations so as to not cause brightness changes that are noticeable and distinguishable to the pilot throughout this range. - The capability to handle up to 5-6 primary flight display instruments concurrently. - The capability to relate the individual light sensor locations to the locations of the primary flight display instruments in the cockpit. - Timing constraints, as related to day and night operations, and reaction times needed for the system to respond to ambient light changes – considering the adaptation characteristics of the human eye. - Capability of the system to sense speed and direction of moving shadows across the cockpit instrument panel and, using these outputs, to influence the ABC. - Built in Test (BIT) - The same design should be practical and economical to install in a variety of military aircraft types, to promote standardization. - Design should lend itself to standardization of component parts. - Making use of existing on board aircraft computer for some of the functions, where practical The Phase II effort will design and fabricate the necessary unique sensor components, and three breadboard ABC systems will be assembled for test and experimentation in static and dynamic simulators.

Associate systems perform functions previously thought to require human judgment, knowledge, or intelligence, using heuristic, search based techniques. Conventional software verification and validation techniques do not apply to associate systems because the system is both a piece of software and a model of human knowledge and reasoning, and, like all models, will never be perfect. Even if the software is completely valid and reliable, the embodied model may be in error. In addition to the problems generated by the model characteristics, associate systems employ both numeric and symbolic information, which make traditional numeric verification and validation techniques in feasible. Unless compelling evidence can be adduced that such associate software can be trusted to perform its function without error, it will not be used, or may not perform up to expectations. In either case, the decisions generated by the associate system may be inappropriate or wrong, and, if relied upon, may result in considerable damage to the user of the system. Therefore, the verification and validation of associate systems is a critical task. Phase I work will identify specific verification and validation issues concerning the current implementation of the Pilot’s Associate software. The Pilot’s Associate is a knowledge-based, decision-aiding system being developed to support tomorrow’s single-seat fighter. The unique aspects of the Pilot’s Associate software will be used to determine the real issues surrounding verification and validation of associate systems. Based on these issues, appropriate verification and validation requirements for associate systems will be identified. After requirements determination, the effort will concentrate on research into the integration of existing applicable verification and validation techniques and the design of new techniques to address requirements not covered by the existing techniques.

Therefore, a decision support system capable of identifying acquisition supportability options and their associated costs is needed. An analytical methodology and tool capable of assessing and providing premilestone I logistics LCC estimates is required to aid key weapons system program decisions such as defining the operational scenario, establishing quantitative performance requirements, specifying deployment locations, and selecting the system maintenance concept. The analytical methodology should define integration of emerging technologies into total system/subsystem logistics support planning and LCC cost models. Examples of emerging technologies to be addressed in development of the analysis methodology are USAF logistics research, development and acquisition strategic plans programs (PRAM) and RAMPTIP Programs and AFLC Technology Application Program Management (TAPM) programs. The logistics supportability analysis methodology should also be capable of assessing LLC impacts of the emerging technologies individually or in combination for a specific system application. Additionally, assessment of the integration of the emerging technology into the AFLC Weapon system Master Planning and Modification Requirements Review Board processes should also be identified and the LCC impacts determined. In the area of logistics supportability analysis methodology, the decision support system should also be able to determine the cascade effect of changing system requirements as they effect DOD 5000.1 defined integrated logistics support elements of weapon system supportability. For example, as the range requirement for the system is changed, what effect does that change have on maintenance activities, manpower and training requirements, safety, facilities, support equipment, etc. During Phase I the contractor will study feasibility of developing flexible supportability decision support methodology and provide a detailed development plan with supporting technical analysis, identification of data sources, and analytically appropriate documentation, and deliver a usable IBM-AT based system to the government.

The drogues fly in a position depending on the drag and weight of the drogue/hose/coupling and the flight airspeed/altitude. These drogues become unstable in air turbulence and are also affected by the receiver aircraft bow wave. Currently, the receiver pilot must make vertical, lateral flight control corrections and make speed corrections with his throttle to engage the drogue/coupling. Drogue movements/perturbations can result in a missed hookup, which is time consuming, and can prevent the receiver aircraft from a making a hookup, which can result in aborted missions. In some cases, the perturbations can cause damage to the receiver aircraft; e.g. canopy/windshield flight controls, instrumentation, pilot tube; with a loss of aircraft a distinct possibility. A drogue which eliminates the lateral and vertical receiver aircraft flight movements and automatically seeks the probe tip position in the last 20 feet of receiver aircraft closure can eliminate aircraft damage, significantly reduce pilot workload, and reduce time consuming drogue misses.

Also, since the facility has limited length, the launcher must be compact. In conventional two stage light gas gun design, compactness and low launch accelerations are usually mutually exclusive. However, it is believed that during the past few years, some unique designs and concepts have been proposed which combine these two very desirable features. Some of these concepts also include other desirable features such as a cartridge case which contains stacked propellants, piston, and light gas.

A LADAR scene projector is a key component in providing the Air Force with the ability to evaluate seeker performance in laboratory tests and hardware in the loop (HIL) simulations. An HIL simulation consists of a test unit mounted on a flight motion simulator with a LADAR scene simulator providing high fidelity target scene. The LADAR scene simulator consists of a scene generation system and a LADAR projector. The LADAR projector converts the output of the scene generator into a radio metrically correct representation of the scene.

This SBIR is to investigate the complexities of applying KBP and NN to five levels of ATR discrimination. Discrimination levels are defined as the location in the decision hierarchy for detection, classification, recognition, identification and characterization with detection being the least complex. Detection is defined as the discrimination level at which targets are distinguished from nontargets. Classification is defined as the level at which a target class is declared, aircraft or vehicle. Recognition is defined as the level at which target subclasses are declared, fighter, bomber, truck or tank. Identification is the level at which the target type is declared. Characterization is the level at which the detailed physical characteristics of the targets are determined, with missile of M1A1. Phase I will apply KBP and NN techniques to classical image processing and develop paradigms and algorithms for each discrimination level or images in the visible range. Knowledge specifications and decision procedures will be determined for each level. The targets of interest in Phase I are buildings, vehicles, and people. The resolution requirements for R and LADAR images should be expressed in terms of pixels on target, pixel area, and grey scale. Phase I will construct the discrimination methodology for Phase II. Phase II will extend the effort to developing hardware and software by investigating the effectiveness of paradigms and algorithms with near IR, medium wavelength, and long wavelength infrared images, and millimeter wavelength images.

The present production process of TNAZ requires five separate synthetic steps. First epichlorohydrin and t-butyl amine are combined to produce the intermediary alkyl-azetidel. The azetidol then is combined with methanesulfonyl chloride to yield the corresponding mesylate. The mesylate group is then displaced by sodium nitrate producing the mononitro salt in the third step and further nitrated to the dinitrosalt in the fourth step. In the fifth step a final nitramine is added using nitric acid. Overall yield of the process varies from 10 to 25 percent. Improvements in yields, optimization and control of reaction conditions, reduction of waste production and substitution of costly reagents are essential to develop a commercially feasible synthesis process. The Phase I effort should examine and define suitable alternatives to the present reaction pathways to increase yields especially the troublesome second step formation of the mesylate. Laboratory scale work would identify optimum reaction conditions, stoichiometry, reagents, solvents, and provide plans for waste elimination or recycling. In addition, techniques and instrumentation will be developed to enable accurate monitoring and control of all reaction processes. The goal of the effort is to achieve an overall yield of at least 60 percent, while reducing waste by products by half.

Tip-mounted IR sensors in front of an RF Antenna result in undesirable impacts to antenna patterns and very high drag penalties for the overall missile. Side mounted or pup up IR sensors minimize impact to the RF sensor performance, but still add considerable drag and also place other restrictions on the missile control system. The technical challenge for this effort is the development of innovative approaches for implementing a dual mode IR/RF sensor with application to seven inch diameter class medium range air to air missiles. Successful approaches would maintain missile radar and kinematic performance while not imposing significant constraints on endgame trajectories.

Maintaining compliance with environmental regulations also affects air force operations. All chemicals discharged to the environment have some level of impact. The major impacts of the current deicers are toxicity to aquatic organisms, the oxygen demand they impose in surface waters as they degrade, contamination of groundwater used for drinking water supply, and in the case of nitrogen containing deicers such as urea, the eutrophication of surface waters by their nutrient loading. When many deicers such as glycols are degraded by microorganisms, oxygen is usually consumed; stated differently, a biochemical oxygen demand (bod) is exerted. In general, most deicing chemicals such as glycols and urea rapidly biodegrade in the environment exerting a high bod. The result is the depletion of oxygen in the aquatic environment and mortality of organism such as fish and invertebrates. An even more serious problem with urea is that it degrades to ammonia which is highly toxic to fish. Low temperatures and dilution from heavy runoff (snowmelt) during periods of use tend to minimize the immediate and future impact on surface waters. However, the potential for exerting bod remains until warm temperatures return and microorganism metabolism increases. In cold environments, the potential of surface runoff containing these chemicals to enter the groundwater is also high since they will not be degraded. Once the chemical is in the groundwater very little degradation will occur and the primary mechanism reducing the toxicity is dilution. Due to these problems many regulatory authorities are requiring airports to control these wastewaters for subsequent treatment or disposal. Runway deicing chemicals containing ethylene glycol and urea are being phased out of use in the air force due to the environmental impacts. In the environment there are organisms and plants that can withstand freezing by preventing critical fluids from forming ice crystals. This is analogous to anti-icing. Microorganisms that inhibit ice nucleation have been used to prevent frost from forming on fruit crops. These biological mechanisms that prevent the nucleation process that initiates the formation of an ice crystal(or the derived biological agents) may have application to runway anti-icing. Phase I: Will provide proof-of-concept of developed anti-icer having similar ice preventing performance as urea and ethylene glycol without the environmental impact.

Present flight control design practices result in unduly restricted operational capabilities, a lack of flexibility, and an overall system whose performance is not sufficiently robust to unusual events such as failures and damage. The desire for peak performance under all conditions usually introduces gain scheduling to transition between controllers. This gain scheduling is often complex and is rigid, and must be redesigned for each new circumstance. A continuous, real-time, on-line, self designing approach could yield the benefit of continuous optimal control. The optimization could be extended to the outer loop, such as guidance and trajectory control, so that inner and outer loops can be optimized together. This is crucial in applications such as hypersonic aircraft and missiles where the inner and outer loop cannot be separated. The self designing controller is applicable to a broad array of military as well as civilian applications, including robotics and autonomous vehicles. Advances in onboard computing power, sensor technology, adaptive materials, and nonlinear adaptive control theory have put the possibility of intelligent, high performance, self designing flight control systems within reach. The research goal is to understand how these advances can be integrated in a practical way to develop a self designing control system which continuously optimizes performance and which can accommodate events such as failures, anomalies, and damage, as well as maximize the aircraft flight envelope, maneuverability, and changing mission requirements.

The interest continues in producing DC-pumped rare earth-doped solid state lasers, opto-electronic applications for silica and non-silica based fiber optics, impact devices, and the possible use of rare earth-doped devices for frequency standards. In recent years erbium-doped silica fibers have been successfully applied to amplify optical signals for transmission over long distances; applications which integrate the fibers with active elements on III-V and Group IV semiconductors are being considered. Other possible applications are rare earth ion laser materials, optically pumped by heterojunction emission in the host material. The key to many of the studies has been the proper incorporation of the rare earth ion into the semiconductor host and exciting the internal 4f-4f luminescence transition not only optically, but also electrically. There is a need to develop the capability to grow thick and high concentration rare-earth doped semiconductor layers so that fundamental experiments and device developments can be performed. For optoelectronic integration, the growth technique necessitates good control of heterostructures and epitaxial layers and an overall thick total layer combination.

Optical and opto-electronic approaches can ameliorate the resulting bottlenecks by providing spatial parallelism and high temporal bandwidth. Employing optics' spectral breadth provides an alternative access to its temporal capacity; device researchers have exploited the spectral domain to implement both processing and memory. This extra dimension can be embodied in a material that supports spectral hole burning. That is, in a material whose absorption spectrum is in homogeneously broadened. Every known material that demonstrates spectral hole burning is inadequate in some of the various characteristics important for either memory or processing. Depending on application, features that can be important include: persistence time of spectral holes (in excess of 10 minutes is required for many memory applications; extremely low temperatures may be required); ratio of inhomogeneous to homogeneous linewidth (greater than 10,000 is desirable); optical absorption cross-section, and practicable dopant density of active species (near or exceeding 1%); and correspondence of the absorption wavelength band with the emission wavelength of a diode laser source (generally, between 700 and 1600nm). In addition, some mechanism for gating the simulation or relaxation of the atomic transition can enhance efficiency and prolong persistence. Current materials generally require extremely low temperatures to retain their persistent spectral hole burning character; although cryo-coolers to provide this environment reliability and efficiently are under development, materials that function at a temperature nearer to 77K than 5K are desirable. The materials of interest in providing these attributes comprise various host materials doped with rare earth elements or, conceivably, with transition metals. Opportunity exists for developing the capability to grow and supply these rare earth and transition metal doped hosts, many of which may require very high process temperatures. Various oxides such as yttrium aluminum oxide and yttrium silicate may be considered among candidates for active species host. Other prospects include semiconductor materials, diamond or other carbon structure, yttrium oxide, calcium tungsten oxide, and various halide salts. Indicated dopant densities of rare earth or transition metal active species exceeding 1% should be realized to warrant extended investigation. Phase I: The objective is to identify, rationalize, and evaluate candidate persistent hole burning materials (very low temperature operating environment is allowable). Identification of the growth procedure capable of producing the material in reasonable specimen sizes and quantities, at reasonable cost, is expected (thin films on substrates may be considered). Prototype growth to demonstrate actual capability will provide a stronger basis for continued support into Phase II. Phase II: The objective is to optimize growth procedures for selected materials, ensure reproducibility, and demonstrate controlled incorporation of dopants into the host material.

At the present time there is no existing technology to detect such defects reliability in flight-line operations. Present commercial eddy-current techniques have insufficient sensitivity to give unambiguous information on the structural integrity of aircraft at depths of about one inch below the surface. Yet, small cracks and corrosion are often present in older planes at such depths, especially near rivets and similar fasteners. Recent research with helium temperature (LTS) SQUID magnetometry in a laboratory environment has indicated that the increased sensitivity of this instrumentation (down to very low frequencies) enables it to detect even very small cracks at depth. While it would be difficult to adapt an LTS system to a flight-line environment, it should be possible now to develop a compact, portable HTS SQUID system which can be oriented in any direction. It is only recently that HTS SQUIDs and coupling coils operating in the range of liquid nitrogen temperature could be manufactured reliably with sufficiently high sensitivity. At the same time a new generation of reliable, efficient, small-scale cryocoolers has emerged for operation down to 65 degrees K. By combining a cryocooler (or small liquid nitrogen dewar that can be used in any orientation) with HTS SQUIDs and other HTS elements, it should be possible to build a small, self-contained unit for routine aircraft maintenance operations and with a sensitivity to detect small cracks at a depth of about one inch in aluminum structures.

Flow resistance offered by current USAF aircraft oxygen systems limits the rate at which breathing gas is delivered to the crewmember. High breathing resistance adds work stress, discomfort and distraction to an already high workload, stressful, flight environment. High inspiratory resistance may produce reduced G-tolerance by reducing the effectiveness of anti-G respiratory straining maneuvers. It may also contribute to the episodes of hypoxia and abnormal respiratory gas exchange. Identification of the flow resistance contributed by each of the component parts of currently deployed oxygen systems will enable us to identify the components which are the best candidates for redesign. Current systems fall short of meeting the standards set down by the Air Standardization Coordinating Committee for aircrew breathing systems. Suggested design changes and prototype low resistance components are needed to advance future development of these systems toward meeting these standards. Phase I efforts will identify the flow resistance in each of the components and suggest design changes for the components which are significant contributors to breathing resistance. Phase II will produce a brassboard low-resistance breathing system, from the regulator to the oronasal mask, for standard aircrew operations. b. Develop advanced decompression/denitrogenation computer systems for real time and predictive decompression sickness risk assessment. High-altitude exposures in aircraft, hypobaric chambers, and with extravehicular activity (EVA) in space result in an inherent risk of decompression sickness (DCS). In the past, general guidelines for safer altitude exposures have been developed through costly time-consuming studies, each specific to unique altitude exposure scenarios. The results of these studies are often difficult to apply to new altitude requirements. Therefore, new, time-consuming studies must be undertaken. Rapidly changing technology in aircraft design dictates improved decompression risk assessment capability. Data bases exist for the development of a standardized altitude decompression/denitrogenation model, such as exists on altitude decompression computers. These computers are needed for both real- time DCS risk information as well as DCS risk predictive capabilities. Utilization of such hardware is anticipated in aircraft cockpits, or hypobaric chamber control stations, in EVA suits, as high altitude mission planning computers. Phase I will develop the software program for the decompression model, and Phase II will provide a hardware prototype for further operational development. c. Operations in both advanced, high-altitude aircraft and in space have the potential for accidental human exposure to hypobaric environments in which the ambient pressure is less than the vapor pressure of water. Under such conditions the water in human tissues may vaporize, causing considerable expansion of the affected tissues. Body containment garments, in combination with positive pressure breathing systems, have been suggested as one possible means of protecting aircrew in these environments. Such a garment would be p73 designed to passively restrict the swelling of enclosed tissues in the event of accidental depressurization. The envisioned garment, which would be incorporated into the aircrew clothing ensemble, should be lightweight, comfortable, and allow adequate freedom of movement. Phase I efforts will identify and evaluate existing and emerging garment materials and conduct proof of concept demonstrations with the most promising materials. During Phase II a variety of prototype garments will be designed, fabricated and tested to produce a design specification suitable for full-scale development efforts.",536,3830,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58001/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58001/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:32:14,,,,,AF93-024_58001,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C1_AF93-024,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:14.826234+00

Many stressful events encountered by military personnel are manifested in the body by physiological events. For example, cortisol is released to generalized stress; melatonin levels may indicate the extent of circadian dysrhythmia; and glucose measures suggest rate of energy and oxygen utilization. Since time and techniques are usually limited in field assays, measures are sought which will rapidly provide a reasonably close approximation of more sophisticated measures. Although test kits are available for many of these assays, they involve sampling from blood. Since blood assays are invasive and require extensive preparation and handling, they are unacceptable. Phase I will involve a monitoring system that uses saliva or perhaps urine or sweat to register more than one physiological parameter. Phase II will adapt the size and durability of the system for operational use. Such a device must allow operational military personnel to quickly determine and document their level of physiological stress (fatigue or otherwise). The device would have civilian applications in that it would allow patients to better administer their medications with greater awareness of their current physiological state. b. Numerous life-threatening events exist for military personnel that could be attenuated with accurate chemical intervention. For example, the biological damage produced by nerve agents can be reduced by precisely timed pre-treatment drugs. Similarly, incapacitating fatigue can be alleviated with stimulants. Timing the bioavailability of these medications to the threat is crucial to their effectiveness. A distinct advantage of a user-controlled active patch infusion system is that is would allow the user to speed up, to slow down or to terminate drug administration if the threat no longer or never existed; these options are not available with oral administration. For example, a fatigued pilot may find it necessary to ingest a stimulant to complete the mission. Rather than experiencing the side effects associated with the brief, peak plasma concentrations after an oral stimulant bolus, a square wave-like steady state could be achieved more rapidly by a patch infusion system. Phase I will involve an infusion device that uses electrophoretic or chemical means to actively promote the transdermal administration of a wide variety of defensive drugs. It is distinguished from the passive diffusion systems found on most patch devices which oftentimes requires excessively large patches because of the slow absorption of some molecules. Phase II will involve a system designed for operational use that would be smaller, more durable and would allow for the timed administration of preventive medication closer to the onset of a threat and the termination of the infusion at any time. Civilian applications would also exist since it would allow patients better control over the steady-state kinetics of their medications. For example, older people with difficulty in remembering to take their medications would benefit because the slow, steady drug levels or the timing of multiple drugs could be automatically administered by a small microchip-driven system.",486,3250,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57181/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57181/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:32:14,,,,,AF93-025_57181,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C1_AF93-025,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:14.826234+00

A requirement exists for effective voice communications, crew safety, and human performance in environments that are based on natural, intuitive interfaces using innovative abilities and requiring no learning or training for efficient operation. The intuitive interfaces facilitate operator task performance, reduce workload and fatigue, and improve personal safety. These intuitive interface technologies include but are not limited to: 1) auditory system modeling and neural network for robust signal processing of speech; 2) digital audio technology to allow integration into aircraft systems; 3) voice communications countermeasures/ counter-counter measures; 4) noise-induced hearing loss sound protection; 5) active noise reduction; and 6) 3-Dimensional auditory display for spatial awareness and communications. Phase I efforts would provide an assessment of the state-of-the-art and an approach to develop an appropriate intuitive interface technology. Phase II efforts would provide a demonstration and validation of the intuitive interface technology. b. Provide concepts for human control of robots in hazardous environments that combine the cognitive abilities of the human with the robustness and physical capabilities of robots. Feedback or human operator awareness of the robotics work environment expands the mission capabilities. Challenges are to develop quality force feedback from the robot to operator via exoskeleton and fine manipulation of human-sized robotics hands. Phase I effort should explore test methods and criteria for operator - robot interfaces and sensory feedback specifications or investigate novel feedback mechanisms. Phase II products should be small force feedback exoskeleton that incorporate small volume, high efficiency controlled actuator mechanisms. c. A requirement exists for an analytical method to quantify the aerodynamic and inertial forces acting on a crewmember during emergency escape from ejection seat equipped aircraft. Efforts to improve open ejection seat performance by minimizing windblast injuries have led to various seat-mounted design concepts. Wind tunnel testing has been our primary technique for evaluating these systems, but this method can be expensive and time-consuming. Computations Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has typically been used to study the forces acting on a streamlined, aerodynamic body. Application to a bluff body ejection seat/crewmember combination has not been explored. By using CFD to evaluate different windblast protection concepts, we could essentially conduct trade studies on several windblast protection systems prior to conducting an extensive wind tunnel test program. Phase I will produce an assessment of the current state-of-the art in CFD development to determine the best approach to develop the codes necessary to predict the aerodynamic loading and aerothermal heating of an ejection seat/crewmember combination. At a minimum, CFD must allow us to predict the aerodynamic loading on the crewmember's arms, legs, and head/neck and develop an overall surface aerothermal loading profile for the crewmember. If CFD cannot currently be applied to the emergency ejection (non-rigid, bluff body) scenario, the contractor must identify and outline the CFD development efforts necessary to use CFD as a computational aid for escape system h83 development. Phase II will identify the development efforts and methodology necessary to demonstrate and validate this computer simulation capability.

The following requirements reflect Armstrong Laboratory's commitment to optimizing the use of these technologies in intelligent training systems applications. (Specify subtopic by letter) a. The successful application of artificial intelligence in the instructional arena has produced automated instructional systems with the capability to generate literally hundreds of hours of instruction. For many kinds of complex skills, performance continues to improve over very long learning curves. However, it is difficult for trainees to maintain motivation and focus in the long run, especially since performance improvement per time increment goes down significantly after initial learning occurs. One approach to generating and maintaining motivation is to introduce fun and competitive games into the training regime. These games might involve competition against a computerized opponent, against other humans, or against oneself. Phase I proposals for this topic should build a prototype Intelligent Tutoring System in a domain of mutual interest to the respondent and the Air Force, where the intelligent tutoring system uses a gaming approach to providing practice. Phase II projects would expand this prototype to a full-scale instructional system. Appropriate domains for consideration might include, but are not limited to, air traffic control, electronic troubleshooting, mathematics, and orbital mechanics. b. Develop a flexible and efficient speech processing capability for use in conversational tutoring systems. Level of interactivity is a critical aspect of intelligent training systems. Speech recognition and generation is a new technology that can greatly improve interactivity in computer-based instruction by making student-system interactions more natural and conversational. The primary purpose is to enhance student interactivity in computer-based learning environments. Phase I will result in a set of specifications and an initial prototype which can be trained to recognize 100 words by an arbitrary speaker in less that ten minutes. Phase II will produce a fully operational speaker- independent prototype for speech recognition and processing in training applications. The Phase II prototype should be trainable to a vocabulary of 500 words in five minutes. c. Develop a cost-effective simulation authoring capability to augment efforts to develop an intelligent instructional design advisor which can be used by subject matter experts who have had little formal training in instructional technology. Phase I will result in a concept paper with a set of specifications and an initial prototype which allows a computer-literate subject matter expert to create an object-oriented qualitative simulation in a technical training domain of mutual interest. The Phase I prototype will contain a library of a least 100 objects. Phase II will produce a fully implemented prototype which can run in an 80386/80486/80586 environment.

The Armstrong Laboratory has developed and is now implementing the Basic Attributes Test, which will be used to select Air Force pilots. Classification, i.e., aircraft assignment, will be based on individual preference, performance in undergraduate pilot training, and aircraft availability. We want to explore the possibility of a new test battery that could be used in the classification process. In particular, there is a need to identify and measure the aptitude and personality traits that predict which pilots will develop the highest levels of combat skills. (Specify subtopic by letter) a. This requirement is for the aptitude component of the test battery to focus on the perceptual motor abilities, attentional capacity and processes, information coordination, processing speed, decision making under stress, spatial orientation, situational awareness and other performance abilities that a pilot must use in fighter and attack aircraft. Phase I of this effort will result in a set of recommendations concerning the content, i.e., psychological constructs to be measured, and design of a new human performance abilities test battery. The test battery design should build on and extend (not duplicate) the Basic Attributes Test. Phase I will also demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed test battery in the form on one executable performance test that measures one of the proposed psychological constructs. Phase II of this effort will result in a computerized test battery that has undergone initial administration, reliability analysis, and factor analysis. Proposals should assume that the battery will be hosted on a 486/33 microcomputer. Additional equipment to be used as input devices, e.g., joysticks and rudder pedals, may be proposed if necessary for the measurement of a particular psychological construct. b. This requirement is for a computer administered battery that uses state-of-the-art developments in computer technology and psychological theory to measure personality traits associated with effective performance as a combat pilot. Past efforts to include personality measures on screening batteries such as the Basic Attributes Test have consisted of traditional self-report personality inventory items and indirect assessments through performance of a task designed to elicit particular types of behavior, such as risk-taking or decisiveness. To date, the results of these efforts have not fully utilized the potential of computer-administration such as stratified adaptive testing, opportunities for response verification, presentation of dynamic stimuli, and recognition of patterns of personality characteristics using neural network analysis. Computer-administration has several advantages, because of computational speed and also because of the use of sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence. Using fairly simple algorithms, for example, the computer can check for random responding and evidence of response set while the subject is taking the test. Items can then be readministered as necessary. At a more sophisticated level, the computer can iteratively develop a model of the subject's personality, that can be refined and elaborated through presentation of appropriate stimuli in a dynamic, flexible format. In a sense, the advent of p73 computer-based personality measurement combines the advantages of an in-depth interview by a subject matter expert with the scientific rigor of a structured inventory. Phase I of this effort will result in specifications for candidate measures. Phase I will also produce sample items of inventory measures and sample demonstration forms of proposed performance-based tasks. Phase II will result in a battery of personality tests suitable for administration on a 486/33 microcomputer.",570,3939,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57793/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57793/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:32:16,,,,,AF93-030_57793,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C1_AF93-030,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:14.826234+00

Air Force bases are required by OSHA to monitor work areas for asbestos fibers. The present method requires that filters used to collect air samples be cut into a small wedge and prepared for fiber counting. The fiber count is manually done by phase contrast microscopy as directed by NIOSH 7400 method. The wedge must be moved at random 100 times and fibers counted in an 0.0785 mm calibrated area. The method is labor intensive and requires much time. Armstrong Laboratory requires an automated method to count asbestos fibers as per NIOSH method 7400. It is proposed that this be accomplished with a video analyzer and high resolution video camera. Image analysis could be done by computer to differentiate between asbestos and nonasbestos fibers. A multi- slide stage could be used for unattended counting. Phase I will be to investigate the possibility of this approach. Phase II will be to assemble and test such equipment to perform the automated analysis. This procedure will be of interest to other federal agencies such as the EPA. b. Current methodologies of environmental analyses for organic species, such as pesticides and herbicides, generate large volumes of hazardous waste solvents which have characteristics that make them hazardous, cause storage and disposal problems, and cause potential exposure risks to analysts. Current approved technologies include extracting environmental samples with large amounts of organic solvents and concentrating the extracts into a small volume. Phase I will demonstrate viable alternate analysis techniques for pesticides and herbicides that drastically reduce the amount of waste solvents generated. Such techniques may employ some sort of solid phase extraction. Phase II will develop the best of those demonstrated methodologies and provide recommendations to appropriate federal agencies for approval of such methodologies as acceptable methods. c. Current techniques for identification of organic components in hazardous waste solutions are very time consuming. Analysis time of these complex samples becomes a problem when there are many samples to be analyzed. Bases can only legally store these wastes for a short period of time and need quick chemical analyses to characterize the waste before disposal. Phase I will show the development of such instrumentation is possible, and demonstrate such quick and sensitive analyses.

With disposal costs for these wastes increasing at an ever faster rate (expected to reach $500.00 per cubic foot or more by 1994), it is imperative that the services reduce the volume of radioactive waste generated to the maximum extent possible. One method which shows some promise of separating depleted uranium from sand is a method (Patent Number 4,894,134) which uses high power, variable frequency RF energies in selective or rarefied atmospheres to eliminate unwanted impurities from a variety of nonconductive base materials. Phase I would be to explore the feasibility of applying this method to large volumes of sand/soil contaminated with depleted uranium and possibly plutonium.

This system gives the Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) position/airspeed information on all flying aircraft within the controllers' airspace. Currently, there is no interface of this system to any recording device. If the spatial position information provided by the PIDP could be synchronized with the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) or Beacon code and time of event, and downloaded to a personal computer, software could then be developed to automatically identify the aircraft type and translate positional data directly to a microcomputer for subsequent analysis. This database could be used to derive nominal aircraft flight ground tracks, flight profile altitudes, airspeeds, and track dispersions. This information along with operational statistical data could be input to BASEOPS, a computerized operations input module for airbase noise analysis. Such an automated aircraft operational data record would significantly improve the reliability of inputs presently used for the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) and the Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) program. This same aircraft operational database could also be used for particulate and gaseous emissions reporting required in air quality analyses. This new capability would certainly lead to more accurate and defensible noise and air quality assessments that are presented to the public.

(Specify subtopic by letter) a. In 1976, personnel assigned to the USAF Radiological Health Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, (now Armstrong Laboratory at Brooks AFB TX) designed and produced a calcium fluoride, europium doped, (CaF2(EU)) based scintillation probe for use in making field measurements of low energy radiation from the 17 keV L X-rays from plutonium and the 60 keV gamma rays from americium-241. Several of these probes were subsequently produced. These original probes are still in use, and have proven to be highly sensitive and rugged under all types of field conditions. The goal of this research will be to redesign these probes using state-of-the-art electronics and thereby improve the overall detection sensitivity of the probe. Phase I will develop a specific proposal for improving the original design (original specifications available from AL/OEBSC). Phase II will be to construct and test a prototype of the proposed design using as a minimum ANSI N42.17A standards, and if testing is satisfactory, provide 20 complete probes for use by the Air Force Radiation Assessment Team. b. Although a probe and system for temperature measurement in Radiofrequency Radiation (RFR) fields are commercially available, there is no interface to standard laboratory computers. The computer interface will provide an easily implemented method for accurate temperature measurements which are used for two purposes in RFR experiments: 1) The temperature of the preparation is, of course, needed to document experimental conditions 2) Initial temperature increase at the onset of RFR is used to determine specific absorption rate. The interface will be constructed using standard hardware components and have associated software written for its use. It is anticipated that the connection to the probe will be an appropriate analog-to-digital converter. However, a search must be performed to identify devices which facilitate communication with IBM PC compatible computers. Phase I will be a search for appropriate technology to allow computer interface between commercially available temperature measurement systems and standard computer systems. Initial designs will consider direct connection of a converter to the computer, such as the Intersil ICL7109. The search will also identify the most appropriate sensor board for a PC expansion slot. Phase II will produce an interface between temperature probe and computer. This product would be commercially viable in Phase III.

The structure of a data model provides additional information about the data, i.e. a semantic context. It is often necessary, due to changing requirements, information sharing needs, or performance considerations to replicate information from one database to another. This requires a schema translation capability that preserves the semantic context of the data as well as the data. Traditional approaches to schema translation require the development of specialized application software that is brittle and inflexible. Preservation of semantic context is left to the programmer's implementation skills. More approaches map data models to a ""canonical"" representation which is reverse mapped to the target data model. Both approaches are inadequate. Semantic context is often lost on completion of the translation process, and the application software developed is extremely expensive and difficult to maintain.

The trend in electronics at the component and system level is for ever increasing density. As electronics devices get smaller, they consume less power, but since they are smaller, more of them can fit into a unit area, and hence the power consumed by an integrated circuit does not necessarily decrease with time. With the advent of two-dimensional multi-chip modules (MCMs), and the increasing interest in three-dimensional MCMs, the power density of a system in area and volume is expected to grow quite dramatically. Of course, the heat density goes up approximately at the same rate the power density goes up, so thermal management becomes an inhibiting factor. Two solutions include (1) the introduction of various apparatus to improve the heat removal ability of as-built electronics and (2) lowering the power of the electronics components. While much attention is beginning to be placed in the first approach, relatively little attention has been placed toward the reduction of power in electronics components themselves, other than that which comes about naturally through feature size reduction. We seek more innovative solutions that go beyond, and most eagerly sought after are those solutions which minimize impacts to existing semiconductor fabrication processes. If one could build logic devices, for instance, in an existing process that consumed five to ten times less power, then the dissipated heat generated would be reduced by a similar factor. On a system level, where millions of such devices would be employed the savings translates into improved size and weight and therefore cost due to the reduction of power and heat. In some cases, these ultra-low power devices would enable systems to be built that were previously inconceivable due simply to the inability to place all of the components within proximity due to the heat dissipation problem. Phase I: A successful Phase I proposal will address the aforementioned concerns in the form of analysis, design, and tests to the maximum degree possible. The groundwork for lower power devices that achieve approximate density parity to devices built in the current state-of-the-art must be clearly established. Phase II: In Phase II, we will request that a demonstration system be constructed to prove that ultra-low power device technology is possible.

The number of signals and power conductors required to service single and multi-chip packages has grown steadily since the inception of the integrated circuit itself. Contemporary solutions for military electronics are limited to those which provide a hermetic barrier separated the components from the environment. The associated packaging approaches, which are usually based on peripherally distributed pins or pin grid arrays, are inadequate in addressing the growth expected in pin count over the next five to seven years. Even pin grid arrays, which are currently used to achieve pin counts of nearly 400, create more problems than they solve at pin counts much higher than this. As such, superior packaging approaches are required, ones that provide the ability to hermetically enclose electronics and still provide large numbers of high-performance signal (to 3000 Mhz and beyond) and power interconnections between the enclosed components and the next higher level of packaging. At the same time, to preserve the density advantage of two- and three-dimensional multi-chip modules, this superior package must support highly efficient thermal transfer and ""tile packaging"" (the ability to arrange packages in avery spatially efficient manner onto a planar wiring board). Needless to say, these packages must endure ground, air, and space environments, and perform reliably in mechanically and thermally rugged environments. The package should in no way compromise the radiation survivability of the components enclosed. And, believe it or not, this package should also be economically effacious, as much as one would expect based on the cost trends of packaging since the 1970s. Phase I: Clearly address the aforementioned issues through a superior package design with as much groundwork in analysis and test as possible. Leveraging into the infrastructure is important, and as such the package features (size, for example) should comply, where reasonable, to existing and emerging government and industry standards. Phase II: The Phase II program will construct and comprehensively test prototype packages that are expected to closely resemble (if not coincide with final products). The packages shall be evaluated with thermal simulation substrates (package mockups with distributed heat elements) for thermal performance.

The ability to modify the onboard information base for expert systems is needed to enhance space systems autonomy and expand the flexibility provided by expert systems. Management of onboard resources is mission and mode dependent; e.g., satellite users may choose to accept a shortened useful lifetime in order to obtain maximum performance in a high level of conflict situation. Autonomous spacecraft must be able to adjust space system performance for various mission critical modes by managing available spare resources and expendable even in the presence of faults. The software supporting this capability must be reprogrammable from the ground in the event of depletion of expendable or subsystem failures to maximize mission performance within remaining resources. Techniques for reprogramming should address less than total update of rule bases or cases verification and validation of uplinked code, use of existing telemetry capabilities of the Air Force Satellite Control network, and operation of there programmable computer module within the 1750A architecture.

Insulating surfaces in many such devices, such as current feed through insulators, dielectric wave guides, and microwave windows, are often exposed to ultraviolet, x-ray, or particle radiation, high electric fields, or contact with high temperature plasma. The resultant electrical breakdown, ionization, and erosion of the insulator surface often terminates proper current delivery, limits device lifetime, or introduces undesirable impurities into the system. A CVD polycrystalline diamond surface may, in such applications, be the ideal choice for such insulators. Diamond has the highest dissociation temperature of any material and the material that does ablate (carbon) has a low atomic number (Z), lessening the effects of impurity radiation energy losses for hot low Z plasmas. Diamondlike surfaces, though less refractive than true diamond coatings, may be applied over larger areas and to a wider variety of materials, such as plastic, so should be considered a viable alternative. Two devices used by Phillips Laboratory (PL) whose longevity may be increased by the technology are ignitron and spark gap switches. One experiment whose performance may be enhanced by a reduction in high Z impurities is PL's Working Fluid Experiment (WFX). Large plastic current feed through insulators, such as those used on PL's MARAUDER compact toroid acceleration experiment, could benefit from a diamondlike coating in terms of longevity and contaminant evolution. Phase I: Phase I will involve the measurement of fundamental properties of diamond coated surfaces pertinent to the application. The maximum surface electric field prior to the breakdown of a coated cylindrical insulator sandwiched between electrodes when exposed to various levels of ultraviolet radiation and background gas pressure could be measured using techniques which have been applied to more conventional materials (for comparison). The effects of commonly used surface conditioning techniques such as high temperature baking and glow discharge etching on these properties could be determined. Surface erosion rates and properties such as ablation species and susceptibility to tracking could be studied by spectroscopy, microscopic examination, and weighing, for example. Phase II: Phase II could involve the fielding of coated insulators in actual devices whose performance or longevity are known to be effected by insulator properties. Device candidates selected for testing will be based on which show the most promise for improvement, based on Phase I results.

This proposed process is intended to provide synergistic information that will substantially help answer possible questions about the satellite such as geometric configuration, orientation, surface temperature, and material properties.

The typical plastic material model commonly used in predictive structural models, such as that of Johnson and Cook (Ref 1), assumes isotropic hardening. That is, the yield stress in any direction is the same and increases the same amount in every direction due to plastic flow. The assumption of isotropic hardening for nonhomogeneous material is an over simplified assumption which clearly contradicts the Well-Known Bauschinger effect (Ref 2). It can be shown that, alternate tensions and compressions do not result in isotropic hardening. A tension results in the material being softer to a subsequent compression, not harder. In turn the material is softer to the following tension, not harder. The Bauschinger effect is quite relevant to assessment of response of materials to hypervelocity impact and orbital collision phenomena. In a hypervelocity impact event, a shock wave first produces a compressive pulse in the target and impactor. The compressive wave changes to a tensile wave upon reflection from a free surface, and therefore, the conditions for the Bauschinger effect are fulfilled in impact problems. Most material response codes do not allow the Bauschinger effect. Research efforts in viscoplastic (Ref 3) flow models have explored the effect, but not systemically, and not for materials and parameter regimes of interest to impact problems. To realistically predict the response of materials used in space structures, it is imperative to develop a realistic and experimentally verifiable plastic flow model.

These signals are transmitted to recording systems in well shielded enclosures located several hundred meters from the test object by means of wideband analog fiber optic links. These links are currently capable of operating over a frequency range from a hundred kilohertz up to one gigahertz with a signal to noise ratio or dynamic range of thirty to forty decibels. Related work in the telecommunications industry has developed laser pumped Erbium doped fiber optic repeater amplifiers for long haul fiber optic transmission lines. The purpose of the Phase I effort is to investigate and demonstrate in the laboratory the feasibility of using the repeater amplifier technology as a means to provide analog modulation of the fiber optic link from an external signal rather than the current method of injection into the fiber. The goal is to improve the performance both in frequency response as well as overall dynamic range. An alternate application would be amplification of the injected signal to produce a higher gain with reduced noise levels. The external modulating signal could consist of a single pulse or multiple pulses. The frequency range of interest is from approximately one megahertz to five gigahertz.

This method must demonstrate the ability to meet the USAF's need for a way to calculate time-dependent response of an aerospace asset's electronics when exposed to a fast rise-time pulse of radio-frequency (RF) energy from the outside. An asset's susceptibility to high power RF energy is determined by several factors: the nature of the incident energy (pulse length, total energy, pulse shape, etc.), the loss or gain of the energy as it leaks into the asset (due to physical coupling through slots and holes and the characteristics of antennas or other sensors that give the energy a path in), the loss or gain of the energy as it couples onto circuit boards or cables inside the asset, and finally the response of circuits and individual devices to the energy as it finally reaches the electronics. These gains and losses can be summed up in a general transfer function that is dependent on the characteristics of the incident HPM. Currently the USAF does not have a way to simulate both this coupling and the response of the electronics at the same time. Much of an asset's susceptibility can be tied to the response of a few components that are connected to antennas directly or that are vitally important to its operation. While simulation cannot replace asset experimentation, it can reduce costs by predicting trends that can aid test planning and shorten experiments, and by simulating the application of expensive hardening techniques to judge their effectiveness without actually placing them on the asset. Phase I: The Phase I effort will consist of researching possible methods and down selecting to the best approach in combining HPM coupling and circuit analysis computer simulations. Phase II: Phase II will implement the demonstrated method into a usable code for the government. The code must be able to model different assets, including missiles, aircraft, sensor pods and external ordinance. Coupling paths should include antennas and other sensors as well as physical apertures like hatches, slots, and radomes. As part of this effort, comparison with simple experimental results is necessary to further validate the computer simulation technique.

These lasers are made from the InGaAsSb, HgCdTe, and pb-salt material systems and typically have double-heterostructure (DH) active regions. Because of the narrow band gaps and valence band structures of these materials, losses due to non-radiative processes, such as Auger recombination and free-carrier absorption, are high. Therefore, MIR semiconductor lasers currently have very limited power output. Once those problems have been addressed, the power will still be limited by gain stripe width and catastrophic facet damage. One solution to this problem is to use a low-power MIR laser as a master oscillatory, then amplify the output via a separate power amplifier. Broad-area semiconductor optical amplifiers have been successfully demonstrated in the GaAs/AlGaAs material system, where nearly diffraction limited outputs of 12 Watts were reported. Because of the absence of feed backing these devices, large areas of the amplification medium can be used to amplify the output of the master oscillator. Phase I: This effort shall explore the implementation of a MOPA configuration in MIR materials. The investigation shall address both high power output and good beam quality, as well as identifying any limitations to these goals. Once a suitable material system and design are identified, all growth, fabrication and material processing requirements necessary to implement the MOPA device (including both the master oscillator (laser) and the power amplifier) shall be addressed. Any unique optics necessary to implement the design shall also be identified. Phase II: Phase II shall implement the Phase I design and develop a MIR diode laser MOPA device. This development will include the growth or purchase of epitaxial material, processing, testing and characterizing the devices.

These lasers are made from the InGaAsSb, HgCdTe, and Pb-salt material systems and typically have double-heterostructure (DH) active regions. Because of the narrow band gaps and valence band structures of these materials, losses due to non-radiative processes, such as Auger recombination and free-carrier absorption, are high. QW lasers have been demonstrated which have lower thresholds and higher operating temperatures than their DH counterparts, which is due in part to the reduced Auger rates in the QW compared to the bulk. The reduced Auger rate in QW's is related to several factors, such as: (1) the reduction of allowed intraband transitions which conserve energy and momentum, and (2) the narrowing of the spectral gain curve as a result of the step-like density of states (DOS), which reduces the number of carriers above the threshold energy for the process. In quantum wire (quantum-well wire, QWW) or a quantum box (QB), the energy- and momentum-conserving transitions will be limited further by the additional quantization in the additional dimensions. Also, the one-dimensional DOS of the QWW will also reduce the spectral gain curve further because of the high density (infinite in the ideal case) at the bound energy levels. Likewise, the QB DOS is singular at the bound levels, so the width of the gain curve is infinitesimal when broadening mechanisms are neglected. All these factors should resulting lower thresholds and higher operating temperatures in QWW and QBlasers due to lowered Auger recombination probabilities. The fabrication of QWW's and QB's is a problem that is currently being addressed in two general ways, namely lithography and controlled growth. The former is accomplished by either etching the structure to form small lateral dimensions, which results in surface problems that are difficult to deal with, or the lateral structure can be defined by selective intermixing of the QW's. In this technique, impurities or other defects are introduced to the QW's in regions outside the QWW/QB regions where they induce disordering of the QW's during an annealing step. In controlled growth, the QW material is grown on a patterned substrate which causes thickness variations in the lateral dimensions, or vicinal growth of the QW material is done on and off-axes substrate. These techniques have been studied using GaAs-based materials with varying levels of success. Phase I: Select a material system in which quantum structures can be fabricated, define a technique to realize quantization in the lateral dimensions, and model various laser diode structures using QW's, QWW's, and QB's in the active regions. The lasers shall be designed for room-temperature operation in the 2-5 micron range, and modeling of the device shall include the effects of QW's, QWW's, and QB's on the Auger recombination rates well as other parameters (such as other non-radiative effects, threshold current, output power, etc.). The emphasis in Phase I is on the theoretical modeling of QW, QWW and QB diode lasers in MIR materials. Phase II: Apply the concepts and designs of Phase I to the QWW fabrication. The lateral quantization technique shall be supported by experimental verification. The models developed in Phase I shall be refined as experimental data is acquired from the fabricated QWW's and QB's. The actual computer model will be deliverable at the end of Phase II.

This can typically be accomplished using a scanning spectrometer in conjunction with a conventional imaging system. Instead a tunable Fabry-Perot filter may be placed in front of a detector array. This design can offer a compact non-inertial system design. Single element liquid crystal Fabry-Perot filters have been produced for this task. We require a multi-element spectral filter for more sophisticated spectral imaging applications. Such a multi-element filter would afford parallel processing capabilities in image processing applications. This filter would afford parallel processing capabilities in image processing applications. This multi-element filter may be based on liquid crystal or semiconductor technologies. A liquid crystal or quantum-well based phase shifter can be sandwiched between two broadband highly-reflective coating stacks to construct this filter. A device which has an operational spectral bandwidth of at least 20% of its center frequency is required. The device should operate in the visible to near IR wavelengths. A Finesse of 50 is required to afford adequate spectral resolution. The optical thickness of the Fabry-Perot cavity should be no more than 20 waves at grand center in order to afford adequate rejection of other in-band frequencies. A throughput at line center of at least 30% is necessary for a successful candidate. The device should have an extinction ratio of over 100: 1. Actuation speeds of 20 Hz or more are desired.

At the present time there is no available software to support processing the data from these MIMO hardware systems. Approaches such as Singular Value Analysis and Eigen value analysis are presently being developed by control theorists to evaluate MIMO system performance. Optical characterization techniques that use Zern like polynomial decompositions have been used for many years to characterize optical system performance. Fourier Transform techniques are widely used to evaluate single input/single output and multiple input/single output control systems. A logical and needed effort is to design and develop software that can process hardware data to evaluate MIMO system performance. One function of this software might be to decompose sets of measured data into singular value modes and then calculate magnitude and phase versus frequency functions for the modes based on the gathered test data. Another useful function of such a program might be a transformation between singular value modes and Zern like polynomials. This would permit comparing electrical errors measured with the control loop to optical errors measured with interferometer instruments. Other useful analyses functions would be Strehl ratio plot computed from control system errors, and rms phase error calculations. It would be beneficial if the software could run on a PC such as a 486. Phase I: The software package architecture design would be the Phase I objective. The successful small business would need to understand both optical system characterizations and MIMO control systems, in order to plan & design the software package.

At these power levels, many USAF applications, such as infrared countermeasures (IRCM) and optical communications exist for such a compact, robust source. These applications, however, require sources which are wavelength tunable or, at least, operate at a non-absorbing wavelength in the atmosphere. The current semiconductor materials suitable for high-power diode lasers do not contain bandgaps which allow this. A solution to this problem is to use an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with the diode laser as the pumping source. The output of this device would be tunable through either temperature- or incident angle-control of the nonlinear crystal. Although OPO's have been demonstrated with several other laser sources, none have been demonstrated with diode lasers. Reasons for this are: (1) High intensities (MW/cm2 range) are required for the nonlinear process of the OPO to occur. The output power of a single laser diode is typically in the MW range; (2) Since the OPO requirements cannot be met with single devices, diode arrays must be used. OPO's also require a clear, nearly diffraction-limited beam over the nonlinear interaction length. The output of such arrays only approaches the diffraction limit when coherence of the entire array is achieved; (3) The beam must be focused to a very small spot to achieve the required OPO intensity level. Focusing the beam this tightly shortens it's Rayleigh Range and, therefore, the effective interaction length. This impacts the overall gain of the OPO since it is a function of the intensity-length product. However, possibilities exist to develop an OPO in nonlinear fibers and waveguides, both of which presently exist. Phase I: Phase I of this program is to design an OPO which is driven by a diode laser source. The nonlinear crystal requirements to be used per diode type (i.e., 0.7-0.9-micron AlGaAs or 1.2-1.6-micron InGaAsP) will be determined. Examples of such requirements are the transparency wavelength range and the phase-matching wavelength range. Once these parameters have been determined, the appropriate nonlinear materials will be researched, and the proper material or set of material will be determined. Also included in Phase I will be the design of the OPO cavity and any required optics. Phase II: Phase II should apply the design of Phase I and physically develop an OPO driven by a laser diode source. The development is to include quantification of such figures of merit for an OPO as intensity threshold of the nonlinear process, gain of the device, conversion efficiency from the source wavelength to the desired wavelength, and temperature- and/or angle-tuning parameters of the device. Such an OPO device will be deliverable at the end of the Phase II period.

An appropriate technology must also meet many performance requirements such as pulse energy, repetition rate, size, weight, and reliability. There is currently no clear choice for a fully satisfactory device technology for this application. It is anticipated that the eventual solution will be solid-state lasers pumped with diode laser arrays and perhaps frequency shifted by means of nonlinear optical phenomena, it is not clear that even in the long term NLO techniques will be sufficiently rugged to survive the military environment. However, the compactness, low weight, and higher efficiencies associated with solid-state lasers will make these devices leading contenders for many military applications for years to come. One approach to the 3-5 and 8-12 micron applications are laser-pumped molecules or atoms as a source of infrared laser light. This technique has been shown to be useful for generating laser radiation in specified spectral regions from the visible through the far-infrared. Numerous laser lines in the mid-infrared have been produced using standard lasers to pump common molecules in the gas phase such as CO2, HcO, and NH3. The wavelength range of diode-pumped solid-state lasers can be extended to the 3-5 micron region by using them to pump appropriate molecular gases. Other standard lasers and optical wavelength conversion techniques could be used as well, but size, weight, and efficiency must be considered.

There exist methods, such as Holography and Interferometry, which directly measure phase, but they provide only a ""snap-shot"" view, or are slow enough relative to flow time-scales so as to inaccurately reflect the temporal characteristics of the flow. Past research in turbulent flow has revealed a great deal of temporal and spatial structure; progress in the understanding and design of aero-optical systems depends on accurately determining the effect of the flow structure on light transmission. Thus, the characteristics of aero-optical instrumentation must match those of the aerodynamic flow-field. Flows of immediate USAF interest involve convective velocities of up to 300m/s ans spatial scales down to 0.01m. Thus, the instrumentation must be capable of sampling, without aliasing effects, events with time-scales on the order of 30 microseconds. The instrumentation must be compatible with wind-tunnel experiments and must provide digitized data for computerized post-processing and analysis. The end results are the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow-field. These can include, but are not necessarily limited to, spatial correlations, phase-maps, jitter, and bore-site error. The system must be capable of being integrated with fluid mechanical diagnostic instrumentation (e.g., cold or hot-wire probes) so a direct link of high temporal resolution may be made between the fluid mechanics and the resulting optics. Beam diameters, scaled by the flow-field dimension (z) range from z/10 to 10z, and the electromagnetic spectrum ranges from visible to IR.

Phase II: Phase II will be the demonstration of the system on high-subsonic flow about a cylinder, with and without a trailing edge splitter plate. Phase III would provide a follow-on system for transition to wind-tunnels for use by program offices, laboratories, and other organizations such as NASA. This topic is important because of the renewed emphasis that aero-optics is receiving in Air Force Research and Development.

Ongoing or previous R&D efforts at or on behalf of the PL often result in specific state-of-the-art technological innovations which, due to USAF priorities, are not developed to maturity. Many of these technologies, if properly developed and refined, may offer truly innovative solutions to a great many DOD and commercial requirements. The following subtopics describe specific immature technologies with potential military and commercial applications. Contractors may contact the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) for technical information packages which support these subtopics. This topic and the specific subtopic must be identified by topic number and title on all related requests submitted to DTIC and on contract proposals submitted to the PL. Phase I: An in-depth assessment of potential commercial and military applications will be required. As a result of this assessment, determine and design the initial necessary refinements. Phase II: Based on the original PL immature technology, the commercial/military applications assessment, and the design refinements, build or fabricate, test and validate a laboratory demonstration model or prototype. A. ADVANCED FIBER COUPLED SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS; HIGH POWER DEVICES: Numerous applications including illumination, countermeasures, friend or foe identification, medicine, and materials processing can be significantly improved by using high power laser arrays with fiber optic output couplers. Devices capable of delivering 50-100W in 800 -900nm at the fiber output are required. The Phillips Laboratory (PL) has developed unique expertise in the field of ""diode lasers"" and that expertise will be placed at the contractor's disposal. The Phase I technical effort should concentrate on developing designs to reach high powers in compact packages, with a proof of concept demonstrator, at the 10W level, delivered upon completion. In Phase II a 50-100W demonstrator shall be developed and delivered for field evaluations. B. ADVANCED FIBER COUPLED SEMICONDUCTOR LASERS; ALTERNATE WAVELENGTH DEVICES: Numerous applications including illumination, countermeasures, friend or foe identification, and materials processing, can be significantly improved by using advanced sources providing visible and min-infrared light from fiber optic coupled semiconductor lasers. The Phillips Laboratory has developed unique expertise in the field of ""diode Lasers"" and that expertise will be placed at the contractor's disposal. Phase I technical efforts should include developing designs for visible, blue-red, laser arrays providing 10W fiber output and mid - infrared 2-5 micron laser arrays providing 10W fiber output. The proof of concept demonstrator at1-2W/2Microns will be delivered. Phase II should develop and deliver a 10W, 670nm red demonstrator and a 10W, 2 Micron infrared demonstrator4for field tests. C. PASSIVE WIDEBAND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD SENSORS: There is an interest in devising RF sensors, for use in low power microwave (LPM), high power microwave (HPM), and ultrawideband (UWB) applications, that will perform at higher frequencies and wider bandwidths (at least 10GHz)than what are currently available. Alternatives, to the traditional multi-gap and asymptotic conical dipole geometries for detecting and monitoring continuous-wave and transient electromagnetic phenomena, are desired. In addition, schemes employing direct modulation of diode lasers are not desirable because of their bandwidth and dependence on embedded microwave circuitry at the sensor. Ideally, the sensors will be physically small and will be fabricated/assembled from materials that will minimally perturb the fields to be measured. The transmitter, data link, and receiver should have minimal insertion loss. Presently, efforts are underway to explore and develop sensor alternatives to the technologies mentioned above. Pending the results of current in-house research, manufacturing and fabrication techniques29 and methodologies will need to be identified and implemented. The prototype envisioned will most likely incorporate various optoelectronic and related technologies. Modifications may be made to sensing schemes with regard to packaging considerations. However, an emphasis on novel configurations employing LiTaO3 or LiNbO3 should be given serious consideration. It is also expected that performance characteristics will be maintained. Typical bandwidths will exceed those mentioned above with dynamic ranges of at least three decades or more. Typical power densities might be micro W/sq. cm to mW/sq. cm for LPM and tens of W/sq. cm to several kW/sq. cm for HPM.

However, an integrated simulation more than often requires large amounts of overhead support. This support includes items such as data file preparation, data entry and verification, large run times on large systems, interpretation of results, and feeding of interpreted results to a different system for display. Thus, it takes weeks of work and a significant amount of manpower just to run one simulation. As a result, both time and costs of such systems make them impractical for rapid concept exploration use. Moreover, data interfaces probably do not support easy information exchange. In rapid concept exploration situations, a user must be able to perform rough order system level trades quickly and pass on the results to the interested community by way of a working model. Consequently, a stand-alone and easy to use simulation package with the following characteristics can provide an extremely useful tool in the area of rapid concept exploration. Characteristics: 1. User can interactively run many simulations with the ability to vary the parameters without any overhead support. 2. Combines orbit analysis, sensor performance estimation, and utility analysis. 3. Provides immediate display and hard copy of usable outputs. 4. Supports easy and standardized information exchange.

The most technically mature electric rocket is the low- impedance ammonia arcjet . However, its performance is limited to a maximum specific impulse of 820 seconds and an efficiency of 35 percent. This project will examine the potential of using methane as an arcjet propellant instead of ammonia. Methane holds great promise as a propellant because it has the same store ability properties which make ammonia attractive with a high thruster performance potential close to hydrogen without the storage problems associated with hydrogen. Phase I: This SBIR will determine if there are any sooting problems associated with the use of methane and to provide innovative techniques to eliminate the sooting caused when the arcjet uses methane as a propellant. Suggested techniques for determining if sooting is a problem are using an arcjet adapted to use methane or using a simplified electrode configuration which simulates an arcjet. Proposals are not limited to these suggested approaches, but will be required to prove that any proposed approach accurately simulates an arcjet's operating conditions. The reference arcjet for this evaluation shall be the 26-kilowatt ammonia thruster developed by the USAF's Phillips Laboratory.

Clouds are frequently sited as one of the DOD areas requiring a significant amount of new research. To truly understand how clouds affect AF Electro-Optical (EO)systems, it is necessary to fully understand cloud radiative properties and their radiative interactions with the surrounding environment. This understanding will only be obtained when we can fully describe the cloud spatial, temporal, microphysical, and optical properties. The use of infrared focal plane array technology to develop a day and night time all sky imaging capability should be considered. The infrared imaging system is not restricted to the long wavelength infrared atmospheric window spectral region. The possibility of using specific infrared spectral band information in either of the two broad band atmospheric windows to obtain cloud microphysical and optical properties should be considered. Phase I: Phase I of this SBIR effort should investigate the feasibility of developing an automated all sky infrared imaging system and the feasibility of using infrared all sky imagery to obtain cloud microphysical, optical and/or radiative properties. Phase II: Dependent upon and based on the Phase I results, a prototype all sky infrared imaging system will be fabricated and the algorithms to analyze the infrared imagery to obtain the desired cloud properties will be developed and delivered to the Air Force in Phase II.

Multipath(reflections) from objects near the receiver antenna can cause substantial errors in the receiver's measurement of ionospheric total electron content and satellite range. The multipath errors can exceed the ionospheric errors which the second GPS frequency was incorporated to correct in satellite range measurements. Such multipath errors can have a detrimental effect on GPS precise positioning, ionospheric measurements, surveying, and other applications. GPS multipath is particularly insidious, in that it will degrade system performance while giving little indication of the source of the problem without use of specialized tests. What is desired is a system approach that will automatically correct for multipath to a level of accuracy and antenna coverage much greater than existing approaches, without requiring any specialized knowledge on the part of the operator. Application of such an approach in ionospheric measurements, for example, could extend low elevation capability from 15 degrees nearly to the horizon - nearly doubling the geographic coverage, allow regular use of inexpensive antennas, and greatly simplify siting requirements. Such an improvement would be a significant benefit to the Air Force effort to use GPS technology to measure ionospheric range errors for making corrections to space surveillance and early warning radars. An example of acceptable performance would be a technique that within a short time of GPS receiver installation, for example 3 days, would automatically acquire knowledge of the local multipath and would then correct multipath in real-time for all subsequent data. One present technique, limiting antenna sensitivity at lower elevation angles, is effective at reducing the strength of many multipath signals - but at the expense of unacceptably reducing the receiver's spatial coverage (by one third or more). Other techniques that combine average differential carrier phase and differential group delay to reduce multipath in ionospheric electron content measurements typically provide good correction only when a long period (more than 1 hour) of data is averaged. Such an approach cannot be effective for the half of the low-elevation coverage where the satellite is rising. Phase I: Efforts in Phase I should result in the development of the proof-of-concept of the approach. Phase II: In Phase II the contractor shall design an engineering model system and demonstrate the concept. Potential exists to incorporate innovative approaches in GPS receiver firmware, or in an adjunct PC/notebook computer that could be transparent to users of GPS receiver's data output.

Sheath and wake plasmas associated with re-entry and hypersonic vehicles, jet engine exhaust, and rocket plumes both in the atmosphere and in space are examples of high temperature plasmas that can interfere with radio wave propagation (e.g., communications blackout) and can significantly alter the detectability of the vehicle (e.g., radar cross sections). The properties of these plasmas, in particular the electron density, are typically calculated with chemical kinetics computer codes that are based on kinetic data taken at laboratory temperatures lower than the plasma temperature. Ion composition data from the actual high temperature plasmas are essential as a benchmark for the validation of the code predictions and for development of alleviative measures. Proposals for innovative techniques for sampling the ion composition of these high temperature plasmas are solicited. A list of design goals for an instrument or technique is given below. To insure overlap with existing research efforts , proposals for small, quadruple type mass spectrometers that could easily be adapted to a variety of environments (ground-based tests of flames, plasma arcs, jet and rocket engines, and space-based tests on sounding rockets, satellites and the space shuttle) are particularly encouraged. Proposed techniques need not be limited to quadruple mass spectrometry. The design and construction of an instrument to sample ion composition in the severe environments outlined in the ""design goals list"" obviously involves solutions to many challenging technical and scientific problems, including miniaturization of the mass spectrometer or other diagnostic, heat shielding, differential pumping, ion transport and reactions through shock waves, debye sheaths or pressure/temperature/plasma density gradients, calibration, and so on.

Development of techniques for employing advanced sensors and guidance in the hypersonic reentry environment meets with many significant challenges. At a minimum, antenna window heating and the resultant changes in the electromagnetic properties, antenna material ablation and local plasma are all key factors in the operation of a sensor. Approaches are sought which would lead to methodology or compensation capability which could alleviate the effects of reentry on RF transmission. a. For example, employment of a strong magnetic field around an antenna window might be feasible with room temperature super conductor materials. Other techniques including material ejectants or alternate concepts may also be candidates. b. Another approach which may be included in the sensor system concepts is the compensation for the environment that accompanies hypersonic reentry. Options for local environment sensing might be integrated into a sensor system allowing for real-time compensations to be included sensor updates. Options to be considered should include the ability to compensate for temporal as well as spatial effects of the hypersonic reentry environment over the sensor aperture. c. Development of sensor systems for hypersonic reentry will need to be supported by effective and cost efficient ground test capabilities to support test and evaluation short of full scale flight test.

As a result, strategic guidance and navigation systems relying solely on inertial instruments for navigation are difficult to acquire, maintain, and service. If this reliance on purely inertial reference is reduced, a potential savings in cost and complexity arises. Several techniques have been proposed to this end, including stellar, radar, and satellite navigation updates; however, new and innovative sensors are still being sought.

Phase II: Involves further investigation, exploratory testing, or simulation as necessary to demonstrate the proposed concept. B. Guidance And Navigation Signal Processors: With the inclusion of update information, as described above, the load on the guidance computer becomes markedly increased. Efficient algorithms are required to incorporate navigation updates, making best use of processor capability. More efficient processing of update and inertial sensor data is also of interest.

Phase II: Includes further investigation, testing, and simulation demonstrating the proposed concept. C. Optical SAR Processing: Future ICBM reentry systems may incorporate advanced SAR sensors. These sensors must be able to process data in real-time in order to be useful in a hypersonic vehicle. SAR processing is characterized by transforms that are well suited to optical or hybrid processors. These processors must survive and operate in the harsh, high temperature and acceleration environment of a reentry vehicle when used in an ICBM application. Phase I: The objective shall be the definition of an optical or hybrid processor tailored to ICBM applications. The proposed architecture should show significant advantages in processing speed, processor size and power requirements over conventual architectures. Options for processor architectures and their technological maturity must be assessed. Phase II: Provide proof of concept along with sizing and power issues as applicable to future vehicle configurations. D. Micro-Inertial Systems: Micro-machine technology advances have shown the potential for producing arrays of accelerometers and gyroscopes in a 3-axis assembly. These devices may provide inertial guidance in a range of military and civilian systems. Currently, these devices are limited by the precision inherent in the instruments themselves, hence limiting options for their use in long range, unaided strategic systems. Due to the small size of these instruments, several may be packaged in an array. The individual sensor output in the arrays can be statistically combined to eliminate uncorrelated errors. Phase I: Identify algorithms and combining techniques to meet this end. Detailed analysis must show the feasibility of these techniques given the micro-instrument production and packaging technology available. Assess potential precision of such configurations.

Likewise, jam-resistant communications and data links are necessary if navigation information is to be transferred for precision targeting of high value targets. Retrodirective antennas can be important keys for transmitting and receiving in these threatening environments. The advantages of these antennas include higher directive gain, automatic tracking, lower probability of intercept and detection, and jam immunity. This effort would be directed towards the development of airborne and ground based phased arrays with full duplex capability. These arrays could contain 8 to 16 elements and would have the capability to receive and transmit pseudo-noise code waveforms. Undesired signals would be suppressed by up to 30 decibels (Db). Because of the high dynamic environment of the airborne arrays, the cost of adding new aircraft antennas, and the expendability of the ground based arrays, these designs need to track quickly through low cost means.

The genetic ability distinguishes ontogenic neural networks from traditional neural network paradigms which require the user to become an integral part of the learning algorithm. As a result, ontogenic modeling approaches result in true machine learning strategies. There are several avionics applications where the development of a robust ontogenic modeling algorithm may afford substantial benefits. These include, but are not limited to threat response and countermeasure recommendation, pilot aiding, sensor fusion, target identification, and signal processing. During this effort, the benefits of an existing ontogenic neural network paradigm will be demonstrated for a specific avionics problem. The ontogenic paradigm, as a minimum, will have the following characteristics: completely self-organizing without any human intervention; the ability to learn quickly, the ability to represent extremely high order relationships, and the capability to represent conditional relationships at the node travel (i.e., nodal interaction among inputs). In addition, potential areas of algorithm improvement (e.g., increased automation, tailored modeling criteria, global optimization) shall be identified and preliminary algorithm enhancement will be performed. Also, the potential use of modeling heuristics, possibly in the form of a production-rule system integrated with the ontogenic learning algorithm, will be investigated. These areas of algorithm improvement will be documented as part of the Phase II technical approach. Phase I will identify an existing ontogenic or near-otogenic neural network paradigm which meets the above requirements, develop a feasibility demonstration for a contractor selected avionics problem and perform an initial investigation of the enhancement of the paradigm as described above.

Of the total cost to develop the software, the majority of cost is spent in the post-deployment/maintenance phase of the software life cycle. More effort needs to be spent in the earlier phases of the software life cycle in order to produce more maintainable software and to reduce development cost. One measure of software maintainability is the complexity of the software design. The ability to objectively measure the design complexity of the software (which would result in a means of comparing software designs), would be advantageous to the software developer. Currently, metric analysis is performed at the implementation phase on the code itself, if at all. If a change in the design is necessary, the entire design and development effort would be repeated, possibly resulting in endless iterations of design/code redevelopment. This effort will serve to shorten this ""iterative"" process to the point where the design of the code is what is analyzed, not the resulting software. Additionally, the effort will provide the Air Force benefits in terms of a shorter software development life cycle, a quantitative measure of software design complexity, which in turn will potentially reduce maintenance costs. Work for this effort will be divided into two phases. Phase I will identify what is currently available and applicable to avionics software in terms of design complexity measurement and defining what is not covered by the currently available measures.

In such a signal environment, which may be corrupted with noise and interference, tracking individual users with limited prior knowledge of their signal is a very difficult task.

Systems can also have commonality in electronic technologies used, such as analog or digital and synchronous or asynchronous logic.

Traveling wave tubes have the need to connect SiC or diamond films to copper and other materials for use in heat sinks. In phased arrays and other systems requiring modules, several materials are often bonded and require thermal, electrical, and mechanical continuity. In the case of SiC and diamond semiconductors, the electronic properties of the material still function long after the bonding and interconnects have failed. A series of recent developments show how dissimilar materials may be strongly bonded over a very wide temperature range without compromising thermal conductivity, electrical continuity, or mechanical integrity. For some using a single step brazing method can fasten dissimilar materials from 0-1000 degrees Celsius, even under the most severe thermal shocks. For large area thermally-cyclic systems, methodologies have been developed to minimize stresses for the best possible bonding. Much of the work in this area has already been demonstrated for the materials of interest, but little has been done to apply it to specific systems. It is mainly a question of identifying where problems presently exist and determining if these new bonding methods can be applied. Phase I: In Phase I emphasis will be placed on identifying which type of packaging and interconnect problems exist presently which can be remedied by the new bonding methods. Phase II: Phase II will focus on demonstrations of improved bonding and interconnects for a variety of targeted problem areas.

This capability will allow strain and displacement comparisons to be made between manufacturers, construction type, and operating conditions. There is no efficient way of measuring and quantifying tire strains and displacements during static and dynamic conditions. This capability is a significant technology breakthrough for designing and evaluating extended life tires which will enable the Air Force to achieve its goal of doubling current aircraft tire life. Annual Air Force savings if this goal is achieved is projected as $9 million per year for the F-16 fleet. Phase I: Will determine the applicability of such equipment using (Shadow Mooire, Shearographic, Holographic or Other) methods. The necessary requirements include that the system must not impede normal dynamometer operations, the system is desired to be remote (at least 10 ft from the dynamometer) and the dynamometer be 120 inches in diameter with a maximum tire rotational speed 80 Hz. The system should contain capabilities to store the test data to play back strain histories during the dynamometer test cycle.

Due to the high velocities and small dimensions of hypersonic wind tunnel shear flows, fluctuation frequencies reach several hundred kilohertz or even the megahertz range. The high frequencies and high temperatures associated with hypersonic flow place an extreme burden on measuring systems. The only systems currently used to measure hypersonic fluid fluctuations are constant-current hot wire anemometers, which suffer a number of drawbacks. The hot wires must be small in size to reduce their thermal capacitance and must be heated above wind tunnel stagnation temperatures. These factors make the probes extremely fragile and difficult to handle. Calibration and interpretation of the signal is difficult, and the probe output must be frequency compensated to correct for its finite thermal inertia. Optical diagnostics which rely on scattering from seed particles or air molecules are non-intrusive, but current systems are incapable of measuring at useful frequencies due to low photon capture rates. Some systems permit essentially instantaneous measurements, but the measurement repetition is too slow to obtain spectral resolution in frequency range of interest. An innovative measurement system is sought which would allow measurements at frequencies up to 1 megahertz, at Mach numbers up to 14, and at dynamic pressures up to 6 psi. The system may be intrusive or non-intrusive, and the output should be reducible to thermodynamic properties or velocity. Phase I: Will analyze the proposed system and demonstrate its feasibility.

For analyzing complex geometries with advanced CFD codes, grid generation is complicated by the requirements for a single zone grid. Some advanced CFD codes have grid blocking where a single grid can be split into multiple sections; however, the grid lines must continuously pass through the block boundaries. Other CFD codes have arbitrary zone interfacing; however, the interfacing is rarely done in a conservative manner making the results suspect.

Copper has traditionally been the leading choice of directed energy warhead liner material because of ductility, ease of production and effectiveness. Although copper has been a successful liner material, requirements dictated by today's targets necessitates new choices which are more dense with higher dynamic properties. There are other metals which are higher in density and posses low work hardening properties at room temperature. These metals must be investigated to determine their dynamic mechanical properties and optimal initial crystal orientation (textures) and how these parameters affect the final penetrator deformation path and effectiveness. This effort should result in the selection of a higher performance liner material. Phase I of the SBIR task is expected to discover an optimal crystallographic orientation for one promising new liner material. The final selection should demonstrate both the feasibility and efficacy of the material choice.

During the same period, cost effective and accurate computational continuum mechanics codes (hydrocodes) have been developed for detailed weapon/target interaction issues. These developments have been possible due to the availability of more powerful computational resources at reduced cost and enhanced understanding of the behavior of materials under extreme loading conditions. The complexity of targets, changing delivery conditions, smart weapons, precision guidance, and an increasingly broad range of possible kill mechanisms frequently stretch the empirical data bases that are the core of many current vulnerability codes beyond their credible limits, requiring extensive and often prohibitively expensive additional testing. The technical challenge is to integrate, through links with hydrocode technology, as much fundamental physics into vulnerability methodologies as is necessary to achieve accurate assessments of weapon concepts being analyzed. Modified vulnerability methodologies relying on a computational data base to augment existing experimental data need to be explored. Such an approach, for example, might recognize that fracture characteristics of a target material for an armor penetration process fall outside the range of materials used to develop point burst models being used, and lead to a sequence of hydrocode calculations to build a data base in a format usable by the analysis code. Compatibility of data structures, and capacities to communicate between codes with minimal degradation of technical content is essential. Proposals should be limited to one of the following classes of engagements with its perspective target characteristics: air-to-air, air-to- ground fixed hardened targets, or air-to-ground heavy armor mobile targets.

It has been demonstrated that in-line fuze circuit modules can be coupled inductively as opposed to ordinary physical connection via conventional means. Ferrite pot cores have been used for increased inductive coupling efficiency, but their brittleness makes them undesirable for hard target penetrator fuze applications. Blending ferrite powders with polymers greatly improves pot core ruggedness, but coupling efficiency suffers since there is no ferromagnetic contribution from the polymer matrix.

These materials must be able to contain high-temperature, high-pressure hydrogen without severe leaking or excessive degradation of mechanical properties while surviving highly oxidized and reducing combustion products.

Surface mounted sensors are highly desirable for these measurements, since they are relatively nonintrusive and easily mounted. Such surface mounted sensors as hot films and microphones have been used successfully for these measurements in subsonic flow, but no such measurement capability has been demonstrated for hypersonic flow. A number of sensors, including optical, hot film, pitot pressure, surface microphones, etc, exists for detecting transition locations in hypersonic flow. While these instruments give some indication of where a hypersonic boundary layer transitions from laminar to turbulent, they return little, if any, information about the instability growth leading to transition. There are two primary reasons for this. First, instability waves in hypersonic flow possess maximum energy at the edge of the boundary layer and, in contrast to subsonic flow, there is little coupling between the waves and the wall variables. Mass flux variations caused by hypersonic instability waves can be several percent at the boundary layer edge, but their surface footprint may be extremely small in magnitude. Second, the frequency range of traveling instability waves in hypersonic flow stretches or exceeds the frequency response of existing instrumentation. The detection of stationary (cross flow or Goertler) instability waves is also problematic, since it is necessary to look for small variations in the spatial distribution of the mean measurement quantity. The measurement of hypersonic instability waves is the most demanding test of such instrumentation. If the instrumentation has enough sensitivity for this task, it should in principle be usable at lower Mach numbers and in turbulent flow. The Phase I effort will analyze the proposed measuring system and demonstrate its feasibility. In Phase II, the system will be installed and demonstrated at Wright Laboratory. In Phase III, the technology demonstrated in the first two phases will be commercially exploited. ??",341,2314,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57054/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57054/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:33:15,,,,,AF93-188_57054,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C1_AF93-188,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:16.003513+00

Surface coatings that equal or exceed the heat transfer characteristics of the substrate of the arc heater segments and that are electrically non-conductive are needed. The use of smooth ultrahard thin films without any intermediate bonding material offers the potential to meet these needs. Mechanical loading of the segments (compressive stress) and thermally induced movement require any coating to be compliant with the copper substrate. The extremely high arc temperature (above 15,000K) and high pressure air (200 atmospheres) combine to form a highly oxidizing environment. Conventional thin film application methods result in a rough surface that is subject to high temperature oxidation and is a source of microcracks that weaken the coating.

In the ground testing required in the development of both military and commercial turbine engines there is a need to measure essential parameters of the airflow distributions entering engines at the compressor face in ways that do not disturb these flows. The flows are atmospheric air. There is to be no flow ""seeding"" of any kind: No addition of gas, liquid, or solid in even minute amounts. The measurements are to be made through the sides of a circular duct delivering air to the compressor face of an engine under test. The measurement apparatus is to be non-intrusive: there can be no material protrusion into the ducts in which measurements are to be made. Any transparent material used in the wall of the duct must maintain the smooth circular interior surface of the duct. Individual proposals are to be submitted to address the individual sub-topics (specify subtopic by letter) except if it is a selling point that one instrument system can address more than one of the following subtopics. a. Structure of the time-averaged velocity of the inlet distorted flow field at the compressor entrance face is required to meet vital aero-mechanical needs. b. Measurement of rapidly fluctuating velocity components in the inlet flow at the compressor entrance face is required for engine operational stability testing. c.

This requires the ability to make measurements of small high-frequency or transient loads. Re-entry vehicles using pulsed jets for control, fighter aircraft wanting enhanced point and shoot capability, and vehicles maneuvering in space near other vehicles need fast response balance measurements for their operating systems. Such measurements require a balance system with a fast response (high natural frequency) and a high sensitivity (low natural frequency). A traditional strain gage balance can not be made sensitive enough to measure small loads of less than a pound-force (lbf) accurate to within 5% and also have a natural frequency of 100 hertz (Hz).

The balance must also be less than two inches in diameter, less than six inches long, and support at least 200 lbf of normal force. Phase I: Phase I should develop the concept for the fast response balance and demonstrate at least two (normal and pitching) components of the balance in a laboratory environment.

Now the microcomputer and user friendly software are beginning to bring this tool to the individual user in the field, which has tremendous implications for improved efficiency at all levels.

Existing modeling languages that overcome these deficiencies such as GAMS, AMPL, and LINGO are too cumbersome for typical users. The introduction of a new class of multidimensional spreadsheet by two major software firms, Improve from Lotus Development Corp. and Compete from Computer Associates, appears to overcome these drawbacks and enable the development of software that is both mathematically powerful and usable by people who are not technically trained. Phase I: The project will develop software to translate a model in Improve or other comparable software into one or more of the mathematical modeling languages cited above and to return the results of the optimized model to the underlying modeling language. Phase II: Improve or other comparable software will be extended to be functionally equivalent to one or more of the languages above. Alternatively, new software combining the properties of a multidimensional spreadsheet and a special purpose language for the specification of mathematical programs can be developed.

The modern occupational environment is such that a worker may encounter novel electromagnetic fields produced by either microwave or laser devices.

When the environmental fields are constituted by continuous wave radiation, the amount of energy entering various living tissues and organs can be estimated using numerical algorithms that run smoothly on modern digital computers.

The technique is powerful because it is rapid, repeatable, relatively simple, and allows differentiation of bacterial isolates at the sub-species level. The Polymerase Chain Reaction is used to generate a pattern of amplicons from purified bacterial DNA and a random oligomer primer. The pattern is dependent upon the distribution of annealing sites for the primer within the bacterial genome. The pattern is readily established by agarose gel electrophoresis, and it is different for even closely related species of bacteria. It can be used as a means of identifying environmental or clinical isolates in much the same way as human fingerprints are used in forensic science. The limitation of the technology also parallels that of forensics; the establishment of a data base is critical to the broad use of the technology. The initial development of the technology requires the establishment of AP-PCR patterns for a large number of bacterial strains which can subsequently be used to identify unknown microbial isolates. Phase I: Phase I work should address the collection of strains, the classification of those strains (if not already established) by well-established methods, and the compilation of AP-PCR data. Priority in establishment of the data base should be given to those organisms with known or suspected biodegradative capabilities. Proposers must have demonstrated competence in microbial systematics and propose innovative methods for the coding, storage, and retrieval of AP-PCR pattern data. Once this data base is compiled, bacteria isolated from contaminated sites on non-selective culture media or by selective enrichment on specific carbon sources could be rapidly fingerprinted and identified in order to predict the degradative capability in-situ. Such information would be valuable in determining the remediation processes to be used at a given site. Phase II: Phase II will involve the direct isolation of nucleic acids from groundwater sediment samples in order to assay for the presence of bacteria without the use of culture techniques. The establishment of methods for the production of community-based patterns or individual patterns from next DNAs should be considered only after establishment of the data base the pattern comparison protocols.

By capitalizing on human judgment and the robot's ability to operate in conditions lethal to humans, the advantages of each ""system"" can be exploited. Human operator awareness (feedback) of the robot's work environment adds significant flexibility to mission capability. The challenge is to develop quality feedback from the robot to the operator. Two specific current challenges are: (Specify subtopic by letter) a. Force Feedback to Small Exoskeletons: Fine manipulation using human-sized robotic hands requires human-sized hand exoskeletons for intuitive control. Force Feedback to these small exoskeletons requires small-volume, high-efficiency, semi-linear actuator mechanisms. Actuators are needed to provide human range forces and velocities to exoskeletal systems used by operators of dexterous manipulators. Phase I: Phase I could result in actuator technology demonstration prototypes. Phase II: Phase II product could be miniaturized actuators on prototype hand exoskeleton. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Small-volume, high-efficiency, semi-linear actuators can be applied to many commercial products. These actuators could power miniature robots, servo mechanisms, human hand prosthetics, manipulation aids for handicapped people, etc. Any actuation technology that can meet the size, speed, and power requirements of the small exoskeletons, can be scaled upward to improve the design of a plethora of larger applications. b. Force Feedback from Synthetic Environments: Current human interfaces to Virtual Reality and Synthetic Environments consist of audio and visual feedback only. The next dimension to operator immersion in Synthetic Environments for training and simulation is to generate synthetic forces that represent the ""feel"" of the objects in the synthetic environment. Algorithms and methodologies must be developed which allow existing computer systems to fabricate realistic forces from graphical models in real time. Phase I: Phase I could result in algorithms that synthesize interaction forces for geometry primitives. Phase II: Phase II product could be a computer program that displays graphical simulations and computes interaction force vectors between simulated objects. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: The algorithms used to model force interaction among synthetic objects in a synthetic environment will be directly applicable to training and entertainment industries. Once we can make a person feel the simulated objects that they can now see in virtual reality systems, the usefulness of simulation for training will increase by an order of magnitude.

This requirement is for the development of a software system which will correct/remove artifacts from ambulatory psychophysiological data. Phase I: Phase I will result in a plan to identify and correct physiological artifacts from psychophysiological data. Phase II: Phase II will result in a software system, written in transportable code, that can be used to produce ""clean"" ambulatory data. The collection of ambulatory data from operators performing their daily tasks is becoming more common and the largest problem remaining is artifact contamination of the data. Ambulatory recording of physiological signals is used for monitoring the effects of workload, situational awareness, fatigue, and other factors. The main source of data artifacts is physiological in origin and is produced by movement, muscle artifacts, eye blinks, heart beats, etc. These ""physiological"" artifacts contaminate the signals of interest, brain waves, heart rate, eye blink, and respiration. On-line removal is required in systems that provide in-the-loop physiological data. By developing methods to detect and correct the physiological artifacts, it will be possible to create on-line systems for the monitoring of operator workload and state. The elimination of these artifacts will permit the widespread use of physiological data to monitor operator state and workload. Several off-line methods are available, but an on-line system for dealing with all types of physiological artifacts must be developed. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: This software would be very useful in several commercial applications including clinical and research neurology and psychiatry and test and evaluation. b. This requirement is for the development of analysis methods and the format for the development of a functional atlas of cognitive brain electrical activity. Multichannel brain wave data is currently being collected in a number of aircraft and simulators. New and validated methods are required for the analysis of the huge amount of data produced which permit meaningful interpretation with regard to cognitive brain function. However, very little laboratory data exists from controlled multi-task laboratory experiments. An analysis system is required that will permit the development of a database of brain activity in multitask situations so that the flight data can be properly interpreted. This includes research in the areas of human cognition and workload. A system is required which uses all aspects of the available brain wave data and permits the development of normative data. Methods must be developed which are mathematically valid and physiologically meaningful. Phase I: Phase I will result in the development of a strategy for data analysis and database development. Phase II: Phase II will result in a system for the analysis of brain topographic data and the beginning of a database for a functional brain atlas based on brain wave data.

Frequently this requires an elaboration of design rationale, the uncovering of design histories, and the progressive deepening of knowledge. These design activities are highly contingent on design context, vary with individual team member perspectives, are highly dependent on situated memory, tend to undergo rapid shifts that are not linear in nature, and are subject to much disagreement when tradeoffs or other forms of decision making are transacted in group settings. Although design rationale may be useful for developing policy decisions, issue exploration, compromises, and tradeoffs, it typically only exists in a single member's mind and thus is not available for other member's use. When multiple perspectives are available to examine design problems from differing viewpoints, there is a basis to translate design requirements into workable design solutions. A case-based reasoning/retrieval product for design groups would provide a distributive design environment to afford team members the means to distribute ideas, engage in group-centered policy decisions, discuss issues, capture concepts and designs, and generate multimedia representations; all of which are important considerations for the Computer-Aided Systems Human Engineering and Collaborative Design Technology projects at the Armstrong Laboratory. It would allow design teams to engage in collaborative case-based reasoning about particular design situations. Satisfying the objective requires software capable of providing: a) design apprenticeship, b) intelligent retrieval of design cases, c) conceptually-indexed design cases, d) case-based reasoning using indexed cases and learning classification techniques, and e) design brainstorming/editing methods. This captures the emerging collaborative design process, then supports this process by merging intelligent retrieval/search technology with computer-supported cooperative work functions. The major research challenge involves development of ""design cases"" which improve as a function of their use by multidisciplinary design teams. The usefulness of design case models is based on the premise of transforming design team members' characteristic errors (i.e., misconceptions which represent members' initial conceptualization about how they think they can explore the design space to get to the information they need) into potentially constructive learning experiences. Phase I: Phase I work must contain: real world knowledge/design cases for the development and testing of the product; perspectives involving machine learning, computer-supported collaborative work, and conceptual indexing; an operational design of the product; an electronic storyboard documenting the use of the product; and a research plan for in situ evaluation involving design teams working on a specified human engineering design problem. Phase II: Phase II work requires the actual development of the case-based/retrieval technology as a product for design communities. Once the product has been developed for operational utility, it may be validated in accordance with the test plan developed in Phase I. Based on evaluation of the performance with an actual collaborative design group, feedback can be used to propagate additional design changes as required. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: At this point the general architecture of the product may be elaborated for use in other design domains. Case-based Reasoning/Retrieval Technology will be useful for commercial applications as it will provide a basis for business/industry to intelligently retrieve, distribute, index, and transfer design knowledge across a number of remote geographic locations involved in real world design processes.

Combat pilots in fighter, attack, and bomber aircraft each require situational awareness for their unique missions. Our working hypothesis, however, is that there is a core process of attaining and maintaining situational awareness common to all combat missions, and that pilots acquire skill in situational awareness with experience, and vary in asymptotic skill level. We are interested in identi- fying the cognitive and perceptual abilities that enable some pilots to develop the highest levels of situational awareness. This requirement is for a microcomputer-based synthetic task capable of training flight-naive subjects to pilot a simulated general purpose combat aircraft and perform various missions under multiple threat environments. The synthetic task should record and evaluate the appropriateness of the pilot responses to events built into each mission's scenario. The ideal system would employ multiple measurement procedures, each designed to measure a subject's performance in terms of situational awareness. The end product of this research will be a PC-based synthetic task requiring approximately 40 hours to complete, that assesses a person's aptitude for developing situational awareness. The synthetic task will be used as a criterion measure in laboratory studies of the cognitive and perceptual correlates of situational awareness. Phase I: Phase I will result in the preliminary design of the synthetic task and an executable prototype. Phase II: Phase II will be the full-scale development of the synthetic task, and proof of concept of the synthetic task's reliability and validity as a measure of situational awareness.

First, the synthetic task could be sold to Allied and friendly nations for use in pilot selection programs in combat training programs; this would require a minimum of system modification. Second, the synthetic task could be tailored to the commercial airline and transport mission and marketed as either a selection or training system. Third, the synthetic task could be marketed as a performance assessment battery. Performance assessment batteries are used with increasing frequency to determine if the operators of vehicles or heavy equipment are psychologically fit for duty. They are also used in scientific research to determine the effects of acute changes, e.g., drugs or stress, and of chronic changes, e.g., aging, on performance.

Flow resistance imposed by current aircraft oxygen systems limits delivery of breathing gas to the crewmember. High breathing resistance adds stress, discomfort, and distraction to the high workload flight environment. Inspiratory resistance may reduce high acceleration (G) tolerance by decreasing the effectiveness of respiratory straining maneuvers. Current systems fall short of international standards and produce abnormal respiratory gas exchange which may also contribute to episodes of hypoxia. Design changes to include low resistance components are needed to advance development of these systems toward adequate breathing gas delivery and compliance with these standards. Phase I: Phase I efforts will identify design changes for components which contribute to breathing resistance. Phase II: Phase II will produce a brassboard low-resistance breathing system including components beginning with the regulator and downstream to the protective oronasal mask. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Applications for personal protective breathing systems with reduced breathing resistance include respirators for the personal protection of workers in environmental cleanups and toxic materials waste removal and disposal, as well as others working in toxic atmospheres, such as firefighters. b. Develop advanced decompression/denitrogenation computer algorithms for real-time assessment and prediction of decompression sickness risk. High-altitude exposures in aircraft, in hypobaric chambers, and with extravehicular activity (EVA) in space result in an inherent risk of decompression sickness (DCS). In the past, general guidelines for safer altitude exposures have been developed through costly, time-consuming studies, each specific to unique scenarios of altitude exposure. The results of these studies are often difficult to apply to other operational altitude requirements. New, time-consuming studies must therefore be undertaken. Rapidly changing technology in aircraft design dictates improved capability for decompression risk assessment. In recent years the altitude ceiling of private, general aviation aircraft with unpressurized cabins has been rising, thus exposing the occupants, both pilot and passengers, to the hazards of high- altitude decompression problems. Data bases exist for the development of a standardized altitude decompression/denitrogenation model, such as exists on diving decompression computers. Computer algorithms for altitude are needed for both real-time DCS risk information, as well as DCS risk predictive capabilities. Phase I: Phase I will develop the software program for the decompression model. Phase II: Phase II will provide a hardware prototype for further operational development assessment. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Utilization of such hardware is anticipated in aircraft cockpits, or hypobaric chamber control stations, in EVA suits, in commercial and private general aviation aircraft, and as operational mission planning computers for high altitude.",417,3093,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63056/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63056/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:33:29,,,,,AF94-036_63056,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C1_AF94-036,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:16.003513+00

Operation in a passive mode allows for both covert and autonomous operation which is often important in military missions. As such, IR can be an important adjunct to active radar which will allow for improved system effectiveness and enhanced data collection in battle. Infrared sensor systems need to be developed toward providing for increased survivability of future surveillance platforms and assured detection and tracking of ground, airborne, and theater ballistic missile threats. Most current sensor systems are based on line scanners and require complex optical and electronic support. The next generation of IR sensors must be simpler, driving system designs to staring operation, resulting in improved system reliability, lower cost and enhanced target discrimination. The heart of any IR sensor is the Focal Plane Array (FPA) which has detectors (pixels) in an x-y format. Current technology uses FPA's having more than 300,000 (480x640) pixels that can be fashioned into extremely high definition sensors with a small IFOV. Future FPA's will have more than one million (1040x1040) IR pixels and will be ideal for the long range surveillance mission. Current large format FPA's operate in the Midwave Infrared (MWIR) band, which is suitable for most atmospheric missions. Future growth of these large staring arrays into the Longwave Infrared (LWIR) band is anticipated and enhanced target information will be available from dual band operation. In addition, exploitation of their full capability is subject to the advantageous use of optimizing processing methods such as advanced frame to frame registration and clutter suppression techniques. The innovative concept should show promise of producing a performance improvement over current state-of-the-art. Improved infrared sensitivity, greater signal to noise ratio, enhanced spectral coverage, lower cost and improved MTBF are examples of desired performance enhancements. Areas of interest include but are not limited to infrared sensors, sensor systems, focal plane arrays, signal processing, and data processing. Phase I: Develop the concept for advanced infrared sensor technology in sufficient detail for a feasibility determination to be made, perform an analytical evaluation of the concept, and perform a simplified simulation analysis of the concept. Phase II: Develop a prototype of the concept for advanced infrared sensor technology. Perform detailed analyses of its overall performance and of its performance with respect to the most applicable mission for the concept. Perform an analysis to determine failure modes as well as to determine other, less critical weaknesses. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Infrared sensors have found only limited use for commercial applications because of high cost. New IR sensors based on low cost, staring FPA's will be more affordable and can be used by law enforcement, fire fighters and medicine.

Many of these developments have already found use in operational systems and will be maintained under configuration management as standards. Current effort is in progress to implement cartographic data sets and tools in sophisticated client-server structures on distributed networks to foster efficiency and interoperability. In spite of these successes, problem areas remain to be resolved. One specific area of interest concerns accurate registration of imagery and digital feature analysis data (DFAD) with gridded elevation data. Because of variations in scales, accuracies and formats registration of elevation data to imagery and DFAD, based simply on given coordinate values has not provided good results. The basic problem results from a lack of well defined features and feature prominent points in the elevation data that are common to features in the imagery and DFAD data, and which could be used to obtain accurate registration. This effort will seek to develop software techniques for extracting features from gridded elevation data which are common to imagery and DFAD features and can form the basis for accurate registration of the three data types. This will permit merging of the image grey scale values and vector features with the corresponding elevation data to enable accurate perspective view display rendering. A further goal of this effort will be to develop automated techniques for extracting the elevation features and automated techniques for accomplishing the subsequent registration process. Phase I: Proof of Concept. Develop and prototype approaches for extracting common features in elevation image and DFAD data products for purposes of automated registration of all three products.

The processors which are being developed provide orders of magnitude increase in computational power, while the interconnecting networks are approaching gigabit speeds. To effectively harness this new capability in a cohesive system which can dynamically respond to widely varying conditions it is necessary to abandon many of the current paradigms which treat the computers and the communication as discrete entities, with little or no concept of integrated resource management, and develop new mechanisms.

However, these performance gains are often not up to expectations due to limitations in the way data is accessed and other input/output limitations. In particular, concurrent access to and from files in secondary storage is a critical problem that hinders parallel processing effectiveness due to the low physical bandwidth between the processors and disks, thus creating a bottleneck in the system. Software methods of obtaining high bandwidth data I/O where physical bottlenecks exist, needs to be investigated as one possible solution to the storage access problem currently associated with high performance computing.

Such tools will be capable of assisting the engineer in the decomposition of data into a usable format on single or arrays of disks.

The battlefield theater environment is vastly different from the traditional environment communications networks were initially developed for. Traditionally, networks have existed in stable locations and changes were allowed to the network configuration only after careful consideration of the impact to the overall network. In the war fighting theater of the very near future, elements of a communications network may change locations, transmission media or traffic types as they move about the theater. Such changes will be dictated by battlefield conditions and the network will have no choice but to adapt. As elements in the theater move about (or cease to exist), the network must be able to reconfigure (or ""heal"") itself, without interrupting the integrity of the network. To accomplish this, routing and management schemes need to be developed which can adapt quickly and without human intervention. Phase I: Phase I is expected to investigate the feasibility of implementing self-healing protocols and hardware for the theater environment. Phase II: Phase II should produce actual implementations of demonstrable protocols and hardware that would allow the concept of a self-healing network to be demonstrated and explored in a laboratory environment that simulates the actual theater conditions.

The simultaneous, interactive use of these programs is becoming possible. Also, computer graphics work stations permit the analysis of large scale, optically illuminated scenes and the workstations permit interactive viewing of the scenes with a variety of illuminations and reflecting and refracting surface textures. The use of these same graphics work stations to analyze electromagnetic systems with monochromatic, coherent illumination has been demonstrated (IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, April 1993). This work will explore the marriage of graphics work stations and large scale computational electromagnetic analysis programs to permit more effective computer aided analysis of large, complex antenna and scattering systems. Emphasis should be placed on techniques to permit the design engineer to visualize the mechanical and material properties of the structure or sub-structure being analyzed, visualize the large mass of technical data developed to assess design trends and to focus on effective modeling and analyses of sub-structures in the context of the larger design problem. Methods to verify and validate the design results with novel measurement and analysis techniques will be considered also. Phase I: Identify innovative concepts which can be applied to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and applicability of current computational electromagnetic tools by the use of graphics work stations. Demonstrate the engineering design advantages by creating software to analyze one, limited class of important problems. Analytically estimate the advantages for an extended class of design problems. Phase II: Develop, document and demonstrate an interactive, computational electromagnetic design program for an extended class of problems. Conduct preliminary testing of the design program to include limited testing and commentary with design engineers and experimental confirmation of the accuracy of the design data. The potential exists for joint testing with the Rome Laboratory using Government design engineers and measurement facilities. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Visualization tools are key for effective computer aided design and manufacturing of large antennas and the analysis of electromagnetic interference and compatibility problems in future, high data rate communications systems. Also, the tools developed will be useful in the education of engineers, and in the design of medical imaging systems, non destructive testing of large structures, and in the analysis of electromagnetic interference effects on airplanes and automobiles.",389,2783,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63088/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/63088/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:33:40,,,,,AF94-066_63088,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C1_AF94-066,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:16.703773+00

Although digital HBTs are meeting today's specifications, the viable use of high power HBTs has been diminished by reliability problems. These devices, with the current state-of-the-art fabrication technology, are plagued by thermal problems, caused by diffusion of dopant from the p-type layer at high temperatures. A new low-temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth method is needed to grow highly doped (5.0 E +19 cm^-3) epitaxial layers to assure a very sharp p-n junction with no diffusion. These devices must have a forward DC characteristic with low offset voltage and very sharp turn-on compared to FETs in order to achieve high current gain and high RF output power. Novel approaches to producing high current gain, high reliability, high performance, and high power HBTs will be considered. Fabrication of simple test structures will be required for conducting accelerated stress life tests in order to verify that the new technology is capable of producing high reliability devices.

The ability to design testability into a system and exploit the BIT as an integral part of the diagnostic process must be establish via a chip through system diagnostic approach. This technical capability will provide logistics organizations with a significantly improved maintenance capability in recognition of the consequences of reductions in force structure and resources. Technology needs exist in both the development of new diagnostic technology and the integration of existing tools and techniques for diagnostics. Chip-Through-System testability techniques need to be established to integrate test and diagnosis vertically by considering the top-down allocation and bottom-up implementation of system wide testability. This integrated chip-to-system approach for testable and diagnosable design must address all levels of system indenture. MCM design and analysis techniques for testability must be established to link the BIT capability developed for the MCM with the system level diagnostic strategy. Efficient and effective diagnosis for faulty electronics requires elaborate BIT techniques be developed within the MCM and be assessable by any diagnostic subsystem performing a verification of functional status. This MCM diagnostics technology will provide a systematic process for design, test, and verification techniques and, in turn, a more productive and cost effective diagnostic and maintenance capability. Phase I: This effort will develop built in test approaches for MCMs which will satisfy specific DOD and commercial requirements. Phase II: This effort will use the developed built-in-test approaches to prove effectiveness and cost savings associated with these approaches as well as demonstrate the diagnostic capabilities on both a commercial and DOD application. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: With the ever increasing push to add more capability into smaller, lighter weight applications, research into multichip modules has seen a significant increase in interest by both the DOD and industry.

The expected benefits of this technology are that the density, thermal transport, and radiation performance of semiconductor devices will be improved. This technology provides a complementary alternative to other existing and contemplated approaches which provide these enhancements. Furthermore, other radical, intriguing possibilities exist. For example, it may be possible to implement the design of conformable electronic systems that need not be affixed to planar substrates. Rather, it is conceivable that electronics subsystems and components could be mounted on curved or perhaps other irregular surfaces, such as those found in the interior of a missile or spacecraft. It is currently common practice in the Japanese semiconductor industry to backgrind memory components for inclusion in the class of chip carriers known as thin, small outline packages (TSOPs). The motivation for this approach is to improve the density and thermal dissipation characteristics of memory components. As such, portable computer systems can easily accommodate dozens of memory components within their small physical form factors. The dimensional range for these thinning operations roughly spans 7-10 mill-inches (up to 250 microns). Thinning silicon and other semiconductors to well below these dimensions (<<5 mill-inches or 125 microns) opens an intriguing if not challenging realm, hereafter referred to as ""hyper-thinning."" Of course, with hyper-thinned silicon, additional density is gained and thermal transport is improved since the heat produced by the component has a shorter exit path. Beyond the obvious, however, are new possibilities which have been postulated but remain to be adequately understood. For example, hyper-thin silicon loses its brittleness, and it has been indicated that components prepared in this manner might even be conformable to a wide variety of irregular surfaces. Additionally, some speculate that hyper-thinning certain silicon circuits might improve their radiation performance. In other cases, it has been suggested that stacks of sensitive, hyper-thinned wafers (set apart by less than 50 microns) might constitute a superior new form of a particle detection system. Innovative applications of silicon in the hyper-thin regime to space systems are sought. Phase I: Proposals should explore in depth the appropriate treatment procedures of a candidate semiconductor process for hyper-thinning. Teaming with established, spacegrade microcircuit manufacturers is encouraged in order to access superior baseline process technologies. The basis for a suitable application complementary with the hyperthinning technology must be thoroughly evaluated. Phase II: A typical Phase II program would implement reliability investigations of the hyperthinned components along with the development of a demonstration application. A successful phase II program would bridge the thinned component process technology and/or the candidate application into other applications. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Although the technology will enable military requirements, the importance of establishing an infrastructure for availability through commercial catalyst applications can not be overemphasized. The basis for suitable military and merchant application complimentary with the hyperthinning technology must be thoroughly evaluated and established to define demonstratable Phase II applications.",494,3562,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,"Tummula, R.R. et al.

Among the many problems faced by space systems are the need for improved thermal management, sensor integration, and embedded electronically-activated actuator assemblies. Micromachining technologies, especially those pertaining to silicon, have evolved over the last several decades. Micromachined features and components offer extraordinary efficiencies in their functional domain as compared to similar ""macromachined"" equivalents, alleviating extra bulk, structural interfaces, and cooling/heating requirements. While many intriguing and promising developments have been reported, some of the most salient micromachining concepts are still considered lab curios. For example, in advanced packaging, micro-channel cooling technologies, with tremendous heat removal capacity, are well-known in the literature and simple to replicate in the laboratory, but they have not been transitioned into applications that could benefit from them. Innovative improved advanced packaging technologies through the development, insertion, and demonstration of novel micromachining concepts are sought. Phase I: Phase I proposals will address practical techniques to improve particular aspects of space system design and fabrication. Technologies that allow enabling, systematic reductions in size, weight and power while maintaining or improving performance and reliability are of keen interest. The categories for improvements include (but are not limited to): advanced packaging, improved thermal management, micro-encapsulated cryogenic coolers (for infrared focal plane arrays and detectors), positive component securing techniques, embedded micro-mechanical relays, micro-mechanical solenoids, and inertial referencing components (accelerometers, gyroscopes). Practical technology insertion must be addressed, particularly noting: 1) the space environmental context of prospective applications, which will drive reliability and ruggedness, and 2) the tremendous potential for cost reduction, establishment of manufacturing infrastructure, and enhancement of domestic competitiveness through commercialization of these technologies. Phase II: Demonstrate the repeatable, quality formation of components. Cooperation and leveraging one or more already existing multi-chip module (MCM) technologies is highly encouraged, as it is not the desire or intent of this topic to invent a new MCM approach.

The sensor should be compact and easily integrated into existing hybrid designs involving HgCdTe or Si: As detector and silicon readout technologies. The sensor can be placed on the detector or on the readout. The sensor must not interfere with the hybrid's detecting abilities or cause extensive noise. A prototype sensor at the scale of present hybrid technology and in the material used for either the detector or readout will be fabricated and tested.

A variety of hybrids will be charaterized to determine the reliability of the device and the effects on the hybrid's operability. Phase I: To proceed to Phase II, critical design aspects must be met. The design of a temperature sensor must be successfully incorporated into the particular material without serious material defects. The resulting test data from the prototype must be proven to work at the required temperatures, and at the scale required for integration into existing hybrid technology.

While great strides have been made in massive integration of active components (e.g., transistors, diodes) into integrated circuits, passive components are often attached discretely to the next level of assembly, whether a hybrid, multi-chip module (MCM), or printed wiring board. Specialized, low-profile resistor and capacitor components have been traditionally employed in hybrids and MCMs. However, these components and the labor associated with inserting them into an MCM is significant. Even in highly automated assembly operations, the expense of inserting passive components is greater than that of the components themselves. This problem will be exacerbated as more designs migrate from discret analog and mixed signal assemblies to MCM form, which require many more passive components than the digital designs that currently comprise over 95 percent of all MCM applications today. By incorporating the components into the fabrication process directly, the expense of procuring, screening, and assembling dozens of components is practically eliminated. The net benefit to space systems is a reduction in size, weight, power, and cost, with a collateral benefit in improved performance, particularly in mixed signal systems which often require complex networks of these components. Furthermore, integral components will provide for a greater overall substrate efficiency, resulting in smaller, more efficient, and more reliable MCMs. Innovative solutions to improve MCM technologies through the development and demonstration of integral passive components are sought. Phase I: Phase I proposals will address techniques to form these components within the interconnection system itself. Alternately, but less desirable are those approaches that depend on a particular type of substrate. Component electrical quality is of primary concern, as is the ability to closely and repeatably form these components to a degree of precision adequate for analog instrumentation and signal processing applications. Preferably, this solution would be applicable and transferable to high performance polymeric-based MCM technologies. This approach is preferred over the development of a new, unique MCM technology, in light of the significant existing base of these technologies. Phase II: Phase II would demonstrate the repeatable, quality formation of components. Leveraging against one or more already existing MCM technologies is highly encouraged, as it is not the desire of this solicitation to invent a new MCM approach. The results of a successful Phase II approach would lead to a superior integrated passive circuit technology that could be transferred to a number of candidate MCM approaches. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: The results of a successful Phase II approach would lead to a superior integrated passive circuit technology that could be transferred to a number of candidate MCM approaches, both military and commercial.",436,3011,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,"Suzuki, J. et al.

Similar trends are seen in NASA and commercial satellites. Since the electrical power systems is roughly a third of the mass and a tenth of the cost of a satellite, one good way of supporting this trend is to provide smaller, cheaper power systems.

This migration is seen in both the efforts of the commercial world and the Department of Defense (DOD) efforts to combine all the military area networks. The result of this technology will be increased bandwidth (155Mbps to 2.3 Gpbs) and many services that are not presently available in military networks. The development of the current military communications technology is only expected to increase the space communication link data transmission rate capacity from its current rate capacity of 10Mbps to 20Mbps. In order to take full advantage of the fast packet switching technology's data transmission rate capacity, the space communications link will also have to migrate towards a compatable technology. The space communications link would infuse developing fast packet satellite switches, such as the switches under research and development at COMSAT laboratories. The impacts to military communications would be communications system that would supply the military's communications needs, services, and quality of service (QOS) guarantees for any far term requirements. Phase I: Research and identify the current developments of fast packet satellite switches in the commercial world. Next, research and identify military communications development and design requirements that must be applied to fast packet satellite switch technology development. This phase will conclude with the design of a fast packet satellite switch that will be compatible with future fast packet switching technology infusion. Phase II: Based on the Phase I design, physically develop a fast packet satellite switch that meets and exceeds current military requirements. The military fast packet satellite switch will be deliverable upon completion of the Phase II technical efforts. This developed technology has a direct impact on the smooth infusion of fast packet switching technology into the military communications segment. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: The introduction of public networks, such as the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks that will be offered by regional Bell operating companies by 1994, has increased the need to develop fast packet satellite switches in the commercial world. The need to offer these networks and their associated network services over the continental United States and eventually the World will be the main driver for the development of these satellite switches.

The electromagnetic environments encountered by these aircraft range from normal operating environments created by radios and radars to war time threats such as nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), High Power Microwave (HPM), Ultra Wide Band (UWB), and other advanced electromagnetic threats. To maintain the shielding properties of these cables and enclosures, periodic testing is required. These tests are time consuming, resource intensive, and cause the aircraft to be out of service for extended periods of time. Increases in normal electromagnetic environments, advances in electromagnetic weapons, and increased use of low power, high speed electronics place a greater demand on the maintenance of cable and enclosure shielding. Studies and experiments have demonstrated that electromagnetic radiated white noise, at levels at or below the ambient electromagnetic noise level, can be used to measure the transfer functions of shielded cables and enclosures. Using stochastic correlaiton techniques, the measured signals within the shielded systems can be statistically correlated to the external radiated electromagnetic white noise. It has also been demonstrated, in a limited case, that non-white or ""colored"" noise can also be used for the same purpose. Military combat aircraft generate a colored electromagnetic noise environment which should be sufficient to allow on-board monitoring of shielded systems. Miniature current and voltage sensors mounted within shielded enclosures to measure the noise present on wires combined with sensors to measure the external electromagnetic noise would provide the necessary data to monitor the shielding. It may also be possible to eliminate the need for the real time external measurements and rely on one time measurements and statistical approaches. The use of stochastic, fuzzy logic, or other techniques to correlate the external and internal measurements would then allow unacceptable degradations in the shielding to be logged to a central computer for correction during routine maintenance activities. Phase I: The Phase I effort will develop preliminary hardware and demonstrate technical feasibility of a real time shielding monitoring system for shielded cables and enclosures. Phase II: In Phase II, the contractor will develop a working model of an actual monitoring system with sensors and microcircuit electronics integrated into an existing avionics subsystem installed on one of the Phillips Laboratory's testbed aircraft. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Commercial aircraft and other systems, such as high speed bullet trains, computer-controlled manufacturing systems, and communication systems, are exposed to hazardous electromagnetic environments. All these systems must be protected to these through electromagnetic shielding.

GaAs devices exhibit a non-linear mode of operation known as ""lockon."" This mode is achieved when the electric field across the device and the laser energy used to trigger the device are above a given threshold. Approximate threshold values can and have been established for laser energy and electric field for specific devices. In general, the laser energy required is inversely proporational to electric field strength provided the E-field is greater than 8KV/cm (the ""lockon"" field) across the device. The ""lockon"" phenomenon is not well understood or defined. Development of an accurate computer model for this switching device may entail determining the major material variables, contact attachment processes, and geometrical properties (switch and contact) that affect the electrical operating characteristics of this type of device. The effect of the laser trigger parameters (wavelength, energy temporal and spatial intensity profile) on the operation of the switch is also of concern. A computer model of a GaAs photoconductive semiconductor switch is desired to aid in the design and development of transmission line circuitry utilizing this device. The model should reasonably predict the switch closure time, ""lockon"" field level, and switch jitter for a given set of parameters. The ability to use this model with existing PC based circuit simulator computer software such as PSPICE is highly desirable. Phase I: Phase I of this program is to determine the feasibility of creating an accurate circuit model based on material and process variables for two different switch geometries. Examples of variables to be defined for the material: mobility, resistivity, dopant concentrations, laser cross-section energy absorption, etc. Examples of process variables would include ion implant, contract fabricatin, annealing, metalization, epitaxy, etc. Experiments would be proposed to obtain the required information that is not currently available. Phase II: Phase II of this program is to create the computer model. This includes all experiments necessary to characterize the various variables identified in Phase I. Sufficient copies (5) of this prototype software and document, user guidance, etc., must be delivered for government use. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: PCSS devices have several potential commercial applications: e.g., radar, microwave, and power switching. Shipboard radar, microwave ovens and similar devices could utilize the PCSS as the microwave generation component since the power required is relatively low and within the ability of present devices. Power switching which currently uses SCR devices could use the PCSS device and in some applications the addition of electrical trigger isolation may be advantageous. These commercial applications would greatly benefit from the ability to model such devices for their particular planned usage.

Conventional baluns (which can convert coaxial TEM (unbalanced) to parallel plate TEM (balanced)) do not possess the high-power, nondispersive characteristics that are required. Design of high gain systems for fast-risetime operation is impractical using traditional frequency domain techniques since these do not fully express the transient nature of the electromagnetic phenomena. Thus, the design of these converters must be approached in a fundamentally different way.

Phase I: Phase I work shall identify and investigate new and innovative approaches to the design of efficient, high power, fast risetime, non-dispersive transmission line geometry converters. TEM geometries of interest include coaxial, planar, conical, as well as others. Phase I should include the design and construction of models (computational and/or actual), as well as measurement and evaluation of performance.

In addition, PL solicits new, innovative approaches to satellite survivability modeling. Modern US satellites are faced with many threats which have the potential to upset, degrade, or eliminate proper operation of its subsystems. These threats range from normally occurring actions such as thruster firings, space debris, and orbit-dependent chemical reactions with naturally occurring species.

New advanced material structures may decrease the weight of components such as nozzles, gas-generators/preburners, combustion chambers, housings, and ducts by 10-50%. New thermal barriers could eliminate or greatly reduce the need for convective cooling. Environmental barriers may permit conventional materials to operate at high temperatures, free from corrosion or embrittlement by propellant gases. New classes of high temperture materials could permit devices such as turbines to operate at much higher temperatures and top speeds, resulting in performance improvements. New materials may also lead to innovative design approaches, accomplishing the same task, but in bold new ways. Cryogenic rocket propulsion systems demand the lightest possible weight and highest possible performance from each of their component parts. Transportation, construction, and power generation equipment demand similar qualities of their components, however, the operating environments of liquid rocket engines are particularly harsh. Combustion chamber gases approach 6000 F in either reducing or oxidizing environments. Turbopump turbine inlet temperatures can exceed 1600 F, also in reducing or oxidizing environments, while requiring turbine top speeds in excess of 1600 ft/sec. Repeated starts induce extreme thermal shock and fatigue. Fuel pumps only feet away form these high temperature turbines operate near -420 F and discharge pressures can exceed 10,000 psi. Recent advances in materials technology can substantially increase liquid rocket engine performance by enabling higher temperature operation, lighter weight component structures, and significantly higher system reliability. Substantial propulsion improvements are required to assure low-cost access to space, global force projection and intelligence collection/targeting of strategic relocatable targets. Advanced materials technology can lead to such performance increases.

Many of these systems will use liquid propellants. However, the development of high performance, stable liquid engines still requires a large degree of costly trial and error testing. Reducing these development costs will be crucial to meeting Air Force missions within existing budget constraints and to maintaining U.S. competiveness in space. One important way development costs will be reduced is through the improved modeling made possible by Computational Fluid Dynamics. Many codes applicable to liquid rocket engines have been developed, but a common weakness is that the physical mechanisms contained within them remain unverified under realistic rocket conditions. This topic solicits innovative measurement techniques that will help verify physical mechanisms specifically in the area of spray combustion. Commercially available instruments are currently able to measure drop size and velocity distibutions in a spray, but work best under low pressure, cold flow, dilute spray environments. To be more useful for liquid rocket engine development, these measurements need to be extended to include high pressure cold flow regimes, and/or high pressure hot flow regimes, and/or dense spray regimes. Of particular interest would be in situ measurement of gas/liquid mixture ratios and measurement of condensed phase properties such as drop temperature and composition. Inovative concepts are sought to expand the frontiers of spray measurement technology in these areas. Phase I: Should identify and demonstrate the feasibility of novel spray measurement technology. Phase II: Should develop the concept(s) identified in Phase I into a workable prototype instrument. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: The instrument developed under this program would have widespread commercial applications not limited to rocket propulsion. Examples include automotive gasoline and diesel engines, gas turbine combustors for land, sea, and air applications, fossile fueled furnaces of all types, hazardous waste incineration units, and other noncombustion applications involving particulate flows.",331,2327,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,"Heinze, T., Schmidt, T.

With an electric system, substantially greater amounts of energy can be deposited in the flow. The performance of these devices increases as more energy is added to the flow, but is finally limited by thruster material properties and system energy loss mechanisms. The goal of this SBIR is to develop and validate innovative electric propulsion (EP) concepts capable of near term application; projects involving both enhancements to existing thruster configurations and new thruster concepts can be considered. Due to the rapid advance of materials technology and numerical and experimental analysis tools, the potential for significantly increasing both the physical capabilities of the thrusters and their underlying operating efficiencies is great. Phase I: Develop electric propulsion thruster concept with performance capabilities significantly exceeding those of existing EP devices: primary interests are high efficiency, high specific impulse, long lifetime, minimal spacecraft contamination and packageability. The thruster should be optimized for on-orbit maneuvering and station keeping missions. The thruster should maintain high performance operation over a throttlable mean power reange form 2 to 10 KW electric. The emphasis in Phase I is on the validation of the innovative concepts that will provide the stated performance improvements. Experimental and theoretical methods can be considered; government and commercial test and evaluation facilities may be utilized. Phase II: Apply the results of Phase I to the design, fabrication, experimental validation, and optimization of EP thruster performance capabilities. The design process is expected to be iterative with the thruster with the best overall performance being reproduced and be deliverable at the end of the Phase II period.

A diverse variety of techniques such as seismic, electrical and electromagnetic, ground penetrating radar and magnetometry have been developed by the hydrocarbon and mineral exploration industries. These techniques can provide a complete characterization of the subsurface in terms of its physical properties. The interpretation physics for all of these techniques is applicable only under very limited conditions, e.g., exploration of the deep (greater than 1000 meters) subsurface geology in either seidmentary (oil and gas bearing rocks) or mineral bearing rocks. These same techniques have unlimited potential to provide information regarding the shallow (less than 300 meters) subsurface environment. But, a major impediment in the application of the techniques is our lack of knowledge of the physical response, both seismically and electrically, of shallow unconsolidated soil and fractured rock environments. These are exactly the regimes in which we face the greatest problems in terms of hazardous waste site characterization and remediation. The development of new and novel geophysical techniques are desired that are applicable to hazardous waste site characterization and remediation monitoring to address two outstanding environmental problems: (1) identifying the subsurface location of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs); and (2) effective characterization of fractured bedrock permeability. DNAPLs are heaver than water pollutants such as trichloroethylene (TCE)> When released, they sink to the bottom of aquifers and can pool into a variety of geological traps, e.g., clay lenses, bedrock depressions or bedrock fracture systems, thereby continuing to act as long-term secondary sources and making remediation difficult, if not impossible. The determination of bedrock permeability is a long-standing and important problem whose solution is key to understanding the subsurface environment for the successful design of many remediation programs. Intact crystalline bedrock, commonly found in the northeastern US, has very low permeability. However, if the bedrock is fractured, its permeability can increase several orders of magnitude. Presently, there are no proven techniques, adequate for routine field application, to identify and locate subsurface bedrock fractures or provide an estimate of the effective bedrock fracture permeability. Phase I: Proposals must demonstrate strong potential for adaptation to field applications. It is recognized that no one technique may be sufficient and the best approach may be one that integrates a number of techniques and methods. Phase II: Phase II should implement and field demonstrate the concepts developed in Phase I. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: There is significant potential for the research in this area to lead to commercialized products. There exists a large gap in available techniques and instrumentation for application in the field. Examples include: existing ground penetrating radar (GPR) instruments are cumbersome and generally utilize a short frequency pulse to probe the ground and have little signal analysis or processing capability. This research offers significant advances in producing GPR data analysis techniques, associated data processing algorithms, and subsequent ""field ruggedized"" instrumentation. Interpretation techniques which integrate electrical and seismic methods have yet to be exploited. This research could lead to a combined field system which samples both electrical and siesmic properties simultaneously in the field. Existing signal processing techniques require too much computer power to be applicable to the field. New techniques are necessary to allow the investigator to have a ""quick look"" at the data in the field before returning to the lab.",559,3932,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,"Pride, S.R., Morgan, F.D.

There now exists a first-principles lattice gas automata (LGA) formalism for modeling complex systems. Also, there now exists cheap, fast parallel hardware which LGA can exploit and usual finite-difference methods cannot. Therefore, we propose building a low-cost next-generation cellular automata machine (CAM). The CAM will be used by the Geophysics Directorate of Phillips Laboratory to research atmospheric dynamics. The CAM will support three-dimensional time-evolved atmospheric simulation of convection, conduction, latent heating, and other physical effects involved in the solar and terrestrial radiation-transfer driving a complex background's thermal signature. Seek bold and innovative research to construct a massively parallel CAM optimized for lattice gas calculations. The CAM should have approximately one-billion processing sites with at least 16-bits of state data per site. The CAM must occupy a volume small enough for easy placement atop or beside a desk and require only air cooling. The CAM may be controlled by a UNIX engineering workstation front- end. Data visualization and frame-buffer hardware should be integrated into the CAM design allowing for video-rate data acquisition. The CAM may also exploit high density hybrid circuit board design technology to reduce weight and power consumption. This CAM will be a prototype for an eventual field-worthy tactical supercomputer used for real-time intensive geophysical calculations. Phase I: Provide complete design specifications for the tactical CAM architecture including digital schematic capture, board routing, mechanical housing, cooling analysis, and visualization integrated design. Design specifications should also include details determining operating system architecture for handling initialization data, lookup-table formats, display palette tables, etc. The design must include robust error detection in hardware and software. Phase II: Upon acceptance of the Phase I designs, commence the fabrication of a billion-site CAM. Two prototypes will be constructed and tested with lattice gas automata algorithms provided by the government. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Novel parallel computational algorithms and architectures are perhaps the most important and necessary future advance in US high-performance computing technology. It is well recognized by the scientific community that new parallel strategies are needed for solving current grand challenge problems confronting our industrial and governmental laboratories today. Lattice-gas methods, started principally in the mid-1980s and currently undergoing vigorous research, are a promising parallel computing strategy because of their exactly computable nature over a fine-grained simulation space. A large cellular automata machine architecture, optimized for lattice-gases, should be ideal for solving many problems important to the commercial sector. Some of the latest applications being explored at universities include: medical imaging in relation to staining and 3D visualization of tomographic scans, biophysics in the studies of polymer dynamics, and electrical engineering in the studies of gate array logic simulation. Perhaps the most important commercial application to date uses lattice-gas methods to model the flow of immiscible fluids through porous media which is currently suported by and benefitting the oil industry. In short, a large billion-site CAM with its spatially discrete lattice-gas software formalism open the door to new computational opportunities to explore the dynamics of complex collective systems ranging across the spectrum from fluid and biophysical systems to even economic systems.",533,3850,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,"Olson, P., Johnson, S.L.

Use is made of UV detectors to sense the presence or absence of flames in building heating system boilers, aircraft, and industrial processing. A developing use is in the manufacture of microelectronics components where microlithography in the so-called ""Deep UV"" region is being widely applied. Finally, the use of UV lamps to cure printing inks in high speed presses depends on UV sensors to keep the process controlled. The sensors being developed here would be simpler and, therefore, more suitable for printing plant use.

For example, an air-mass is a meteorological object with characteristic moisture, temperature and stability attributes. A warm tropical maritime air-mass has an entirely different range of appropriate values for these quantities than does a cold polar continental air-mass. Each new meteorological expert system that refers to air-masses must redefine them. This laborious task detracts from the effort devoted to generating the knowledge base that is the heart of any expert system. In particular, the lack of a library of common meteorological entities and processes in an appropriate database prevents the development of computerized synoptic climatologies. Synoptic climatology differs from statistical climatology in providing the characteristic weather pattern for a region (including most prevalent air-mass type), rather than simply monthly averages of weather parameters such as temperature and precipitation. In the past, the lack of computerized, accessible synoptic climatologies has hampered Air Force weather forecasters operating in unfamiliar regions under data-sparse conditions. Phase I: Phase I of this project will consist of collating and defining the majority of commonly encountered meteorological objects and processes and listing their attributes. The minimum objectbase resulting from this effort will contain all the objects necessary to incorporate the synoptic climatology provided to the successful bidder by the government. Phase II: Phase II will consist of coding of this library into a meteorological database and selecting appropriate values for the attributes, based on physical principles and general climatology. As a test of the completeness and accuracy of the objectbase, all available synoptic climatologies will be incorporated into the system.

An alternative solution is to develop a low maintenance replacement system, complete with an environmentally acceptable, cost-effective, non-flammable refrigerant.

Separate or combined proposals are acceptable for the following subtopics. a. Flourocarbon additives have been developed for highly effective particulate removal. The innovative development of a flourocarbon additive that has the capability to remove hydrocarbon oils, greases, and resin fluxes would result in the creation of a cleaning fluid highly comparable to Freon 113. Such a material will fill a critical need in closed loop, recirculating, precision cleaning processes. In addition, such a solvent may provide an innovative, highly inert, non volatile residue, environmentally acceptable replacement fluid/process to remove highly flamable substance residuals, particulate contaminates, water and other contaminating materials from systems that handle highly oxidizing materials. b. In aqueous cleaning, the parts are first immersed in an aqueous/ surfactant solution. In semiaqueous cleaning, parts are first immersed in a hydrocarbon based solution. In either case, the contaminate laden solution is flushed from the parts by rinsing the water. A need exists to provide an improved method for removing the rinse water from the cleaned parts. In the past CFC-113/surfactant mixtures have successfully been used as decanting liquids to remove water from the cleaned parts. An alternative might consist of displacing the water by innovative, volatile, nonflammable, immiscible liquid. In addition, both aqueous and semiaqueous cleaning solutions are not effective particulate contaminate removers in the area of < 5 micron particle size. In the case of critical cleaning processes, there is a need to improve the capability of these solutions for removal of small particulate contaminates. Phase I: Phase I will result in the demonstration of improved flourocarbon, semiaqueous and aqueous cleaning processes applied to selected parts. Phase II: Phase II will result in the development and implementation of a production precision cleaning process. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: The contractor who develops OLDS-free enhancements to critical cleaning processes will find wide commercial acceptance for his products.

To be feasible, these systems need integrated guidance and navigation subsystems that can provide better accuracy (miss distances of less than 3 meters over ranges in excess of 12,000 KM and lasting almost 2 hours) and significant reduction in the overall cost of ownership than currently available technologies. It is believed that technologies that have multiple applications, especially commercial applications will have a tendency to be more cost effective to procure and to maintain. For this reason, technologies with high commercial potential will be given special consideration. Technologies that are not totally inertial based, but provide for means of position identification or position location error reduction are sought. Due to the hypersonic speeds, constrained weight and available onboard power, size and weight reduction along with low power requirements will be deemed very critical in evaluating prospective technologies. Some of the required guidance and navigation capabilities include: Terminal errors of less than 3 meters; Immunity to active and passive countermeasures; Low procurement costs; Low maintenance costs; and Small size, low weight and low power requirements. Several of the concepts examined might use inertial systems updated by radars, optical sensors, or satellites. Although these concepts would provide good accuracy, they have not been able to meet the combined critical objectives described. Consequently, these concepts serve as a point of departure for innovative techniques and their definition will be made available upon request.

Recyclable AP is recovered from: (1) the demilitarization of missile motors, and (2) from manufacture of new AP which is unsuitable for use in motors without additional processing (remanufacturing). The highest value application of the reclaimed AP is in the manufacture of new military and commercial rocket motors. The particle size distribution, crystal shape, density and chemical purity are attributes that are important for ballistic and physical property control in propellant manufacture. Recrystallization of reclaimed AP poses some unique challenges that require innovative solutions. Trace contaminants brought over from other components of the propellant may impact crystal habit (shape of the crystals), nucleation rates and nucleation sites (affecting rate of growth and final crystal size). Also, trace impurities may interfere with propellant curing, burn rate, and mechanical properties. Innovative research is required to develop an efficient, affordable process to remanufacture reclaimed AP in production quantities that satisfies the chemical and physical properties including particle size distribution specified for propellant grade AP. Successful process development will benefit not only environmental concerns but also cost effective manufacture of military and commercial rocket engines.

One way to achieve the high brightness from some of these applications requires the use of the master oscillator power amplifier approach. In this approach it is necessary to efficiently divide and one-way couple power from the master oscillator to the several amplifiers and then coherently combine the outputs. It has proven difficult to achieve all of the required devices or operations monolithically on one chip. A hybrid approach using microoptics may be more practical. This approach may require anamorphic lenses, beam splitters, phase shifters, polarizers, waveplates, etc., to one-way couple from the master oscillator to the amplifiers and have all the outputs properly phased. This topic is seeking the development of techniques for the design, fabrication, and mounting of such microoptic devices. How the device fits into a whole system should be considered, since it does no good to have a waveguide modulator if there are no microoptics to efficiently and reliably couple into and out of the modulator from the preceding and following devices. Micro mounting techniques as well as microoptics need to be developed. Phase I: Procedures and processes are developed for the design, fabrication and mounting of individual devices that are compatible with a complete system. Phase II: A complete system is demonstrated using the procedure, processes and techniques developed in Phase I. The system must demonstrate a significant capability.

The USAF has demonstrated the use of laser beacons as a light reference source allowing the adaptive optics sensors to measure the wavefront distortions created by the atmosphere. Laser beacons are created by focusing a laser in the atmosphere. A sensor behind the telescope detects light scattered by the atmosphere and adjusts the surface of a deformable or ""rubber"" mirror to cancel the distortion. It is only possible to use this concept at night since the strength of the signal scattered back into the telescope is very weak. This signal is completely masked by noise from the bright sky in the daytime. Current optical filters have inadequate throughput, out-of-band rejection, and linewidth to permit daytime operation of adaptive optics using laser beacons. In operating laser beacon adaptive optics the sensor must not be blinded by laser light scattered by the telescope optics as the pulsed laser beam leaves the telescope. It is necessary to sense light scattered only from a small ""range gate"" in the atmosphere where the beam is focused to a small spot. The optical filter must be switchable from high throughput to high rejection, quickly (100 nanoseconds or less) at repetition rates up to 5,000 times per second. It is important to protect other sensors and cameras from the scattered laser light. Also desirable is the ability to configure the filter to operate in a mode that rejects light from a narrow spectral region centered on the laser line wavelength but have high throughput for all other wavelengths. There are requirements for optical filters operating at copper vapor laser wavelengths of 5l0.6 and 578.2 nm and at the sodium D2 line of 589 nm. Phase I: Select a concept, fabricate a laboratory model, and experimentally characterize its performance. Successfully demonstrate the laboratory model (chosen filter concept) to prove it's feasibility and provide quantitative data which satisfies the following specifications: 0.8; out-of-band rejection: >10,000,000; field of view: >30 degrees full angle; switchable from high throughput to high rejection in tens of nanoseconds at rates up to 5,000 times per second. Phase II: Produce usable filters for test and evaluation in laser beacon adaptive optics experiments at the Starfire Optical Range, Kirtland AFB NM. The filters will be evaluated for throughput, out-of-band rejection, and ability to serve as a range-gating mechanism to reject near field scatter from optics and the lower atmosphere. This phase also includes packing the filter for use in laser beacon adaptive optics experiments on large telescopes with high power lasers. The filters would be needed as high throughput, high rejection, switchable devices for use with copper vapor and sodium frequency lasers and will be operated on 1.5 and 3.5m telescopes with ultrahigh sensitivity, ultra low noise wavefront sensors and cameras. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Laser guide star adaptive optics offer a high value commercial application in transmitting electrical power to geosynchronous communications satellites to extend their operational life. The satellite's life is limited by deep cycling of it's batteries during earth eclipses lasting approximately one hour per day for periods of approximately 45 days twice per year. Charging the satellite's batteries with the use of ground based lasers during these periods can extend the satellite's life 5-15 years, resulting in revenues of 20-50 million dollars per satellite per year. Satellite owners are interested in developing a network of ground based sites that could beam power commercially to their satellites on a world wide basis. A large commercial market for narrow band optical filters exists today. Ultra-narrow, high throughput filters developed under this effort would immediately expand this market and find acceptance in many commercial applications, including medical imaging, non-destructive testing, ultra high resolution spectroscopy, surveillance, astronomical imaging cameras, daytime laser communications with GEO and LEO satellites and deep space probes, solar astronomy, and many other applications.",650,4278,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,"Shay, T.M., Garcia, D.F.

While these approaches can work well, we are interested in an improved design for high quality optical trains. The selected approach would provide a near-lossless, high Strehl ratio technique which either measured or controlled the deleterious air turbulence, vibration, and thermal gradient effects. In particular, a concept that can be built in Phase II is desired. One function of the hardware package would be to account for any predictable air flow and minimize air turbulence. A good understanding of air flow and turbulence effects on optical performance is essential. Similarly, seismic vibrations in the beam train can cause acoustical coupling or otherwise disrupt the BPC system. Finally, thermal gradients among optical elements, ambient gas, and container sidewalls can induce optical degradations. These effects should be analyzed in considerable detail during Phase I so that the eventual hardware program can be used to validate the design in a brassboard environment. The BPC approach itself is to concentrate on ""clean"" techniques with recyclable constituents, if applicable. Phase I: The objective of the Phase I program is to produce a BPC design supported by analysis and/or simulation. The successful small business would have to understand optical system characterizations and fluid flow to verify the design in ""software"". Phase II: The second phase will require the development of a BPC system for a scaled down brassboard optical train so that individual effects can be monitored and performance evaluated. The Phillips Laboratory (PL) would provide access to such a brassboard for the final level of checkout. Ideally, in Phase III a commercial package should be developed that could be installed in optical systems around the world to mitigate one adverse effect. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: We expect that the fields of astronomy, imaging, laser propagation, and optical surveillance would be interested in a clean BPC hardware design. A recent example of how clean beam trains can be commercialized is the Laser Guide Star (LGS) adaptive optics technique, which was developed in the defense department and is now being used in the astronomy community. A final dual use commercial technology which can take advantage of the new BPC technique is the ""power beaming"" of energy to sustain geosynchronous satellites. These expensive satellites occasionally lose contact with the sun and can be resupplied with energy from the ground, but the optical train required to supply that energy would have severe limitations in delivering energy unless the beam train were conditioned to a high level. commercial package that could be installed in optical systems around the world to mitigate one adverse effect.

Until recently, the semiconductor laser was not able to produce output powers high enough for medical applications and had a very limited wavelength range. Semiconductor lasers are currently emitting watts of output power from a single device and tens of watts from a single bar. Material systems other than the conventional AlGaAs system have been developed allowing the semiconductor laser to lase from 630 nm to 2.2 um at output powers of 100s of mW or more. With these advances, the semiconductor laser has the potential of replacing most existing medical lasers for continuous wave applications. Building a single semiconductor laser system for a variety of medical applications is very difficult, since each application requires different operating parameters. The high power systems being developed need to be refined for specific applications. It is also important that use of semiconductor lasers in an application be advantageous over other conventional procedures. Phase I: Select a promising application utilizing semiconductor lasers. The contractor shall perform preliminary investigations to determine laser specifications for the chosen application and required system design parameters. At the end of Phase I, a preliminary design will be delivered. Phase II: Build and optimize the laser system by conducting tests in the environment in which it will be used.

One way to ruggedize the system and possibly increase the efficiency of the process is to develop lasers which incorporate gain and frequency conversion capabilities in one cavity. These sources could be considered monolithic or quasi-monolithic lasers. Additional important considerations involve passive Q-switching and mode-locking methods which could be an integral part of the gain media. These laser sources would have an immediate impact on many Air Force and commercial applications including communications and environmental monitoring. Phase I: The Phase I effort should be directed toward understanding technical issues associated with laser configurations which incorporate multiple optical processes in a single laser cavity. Experiments, supported by theoretical analysis, should be performed which provide possible candidate nonlinear optical materials and gain media appropriate for generating 2-5 micron laser radiation. Solid-state materials which can be diode laser pumped are required. During this phase, a preliminary design for the Phase II device demonstration should be developed. Phase II: Phase II should demonstrate a 5 watt, near diffraction limited device which is tunable in the 2-5 micron wavelength region.

One way to possibly increase the efficiency of the process is to find solid-state materials which lase directly in the mid-infrared, particularly in the 3-5 micron band. Also of interest are solid-state materials which lase at 1.178 microns. Frequency doubling at 1.06 microns has been accomplished at efficiencies exceeding 70-80 percent (optical to optical), so frequency doubling 1.178 microns to 589 nanometers could produce similar efficiencies. We are seeking proposals in these areas. On-going research in the Air Force, other Government organizations, in the environmental monitoring community, and the astronomical community can benefit from solid-state laser materials research in these areas. Phase I: The Phase I effort should be directed toward researching the physics associated with solid-state materials which lase in the 2-5 micron band or at 1.178 microns. Nonlinear frequency conversion processes should not be considered. Experiments, supported by theoretical analysis, should be performed which provide possible gain media candidates. Materials which can be diode-pumped are preferred. During this phase, a preliminary design for the Phase II device should also be developed. Phase II: Phase II should provide expanded proof of concept by fabricating a greater than 10 Watt average power, less than two times diffraction limited, mid-infrared laser source.

Current encoders do not provide any on-board processing capability. This encoder should be programmable to meet both engineering and scientific needs. Programming can be done through a computer interface or via firmware. Examples of programmable parameters should include, but not be limited to the following: type of output code; output bit rate--up to 2MBit/sec; word length 8 to 16 bits; number or words per frame; straight, super, sub and super-sub commutation capability; the ability to provide a data point to the PCM stream on a change only basis (for example, often parameters such as battery voltage or temperature are only of interest when they change, or go above or below a certain point); real-time signal processing algorithms (for example, there are times when raw data is of no interest and only the fourier transform, average, root mean square, etc., of the data is required). IRIG-106-93 should be used as a reference. The output of the encoder must be range compatible. This encoder will be used in sounding rocket and other aerospace applications. The encoder should have the capability to withstand a high vibration, large temperature extreme environment such as seen during a rocket launch or aboard the Space Shutte. This does not preclude the use of commercial technology or parts. While radiation hardening should be a consideration, it is realized that it would come at a greatly increased cost. Radiation hardening is considered to be beyond the scope of a proposal of this nature. Phase I: Phase I will provide a comprehensive and workable design, part selection and sample programming. The design should clearly show its flexibility and its low cost approach. Phase II: Phase II will be the building and testing (both functionally and environmentally) of a working prototype. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: As a rugged, robust piece of equipment, this encoder could find application in a variety of remotely-operated devices that must transmit telemetry, for example, robotic devices in certain manufacturing processes or environmental cleanup, scientific devices used for deep sea or volcano exploration.

The control moment gyros should provide an output torque and storage of an angular momentum that bridges the gap that currently exists between reaction wheels and control moment gyros (i.e., 2 to 10 foot pounds). Secondly, for both the single and double gimballed control moment gyros, it is desirable that only one and not a series of each will be necessary to bridge the gap previously described. Finally, these control moment gyros should be compact, light-weight, consume as little power as possible, and should have a reliability figure of 0.98 after 4 years. The intended use of these control moment gyros are to control small spacecraft (approximately 2000 pounds or less) which have a requirement to provide a rapid maneuvering capability and compensate large unbalanced induced torques.

One major obstacle is the cost of access to space, which is often driven by launch costs and the size and complexity of spacecraft required. Often, space missions cannot be adequately performed by satellites without ""3-axis stabilization;"" however, the requisite stabilization systems, including reaction wheels and/or control moment gyros, have historically been either too large or not as accurate as desired.

""Robust"" is used in the sense that patterns of all types are included, for example numeric patterns, symbolic patterns, string-based patterns, and patterns in images. Recent research provides strong theoretical and empirical evidence that Decomposed Function Cardinality (DFC) provides a robust basis for pattern finding. Applications of DFC-based pattern finding are possible in many areas. However, application development has been hampered because current algorithms are limited to binary functions with a limited number of input variables and a single output variable. Phase I: The goals of Phase I are to 1) identify innovative applications, and 2) determine the technical merit and feasibility of pattern finding algorithms to meet the requirements of these applications. These applications may require extensions to the current pattern finding algorithms. Examples of such extensions are 1) provisions for multiple output variables, a larger number of inputs, or multiple-valued input and output variables, 2) a treatment of objects that are not functions, or 3) the exploitation of prior knowledge about the pattern. The Phase I effort will also define approaches to developing any extensions necessary for the identified applications.

But first, the research must identify as many categories as possible of first-order and second-order motion. Next, the research will develop algorithms to generate image-sequences that display the phenomena. Finally, the test suite will be developed.

The ability to accomplish sensor management, multisource data fusion and internetted operations in tactical scenarios has greatly influenced weapon system capabilities and tactics. The ability to fuse data from various sources, such as on-board sensors and off-board assets, will lead to improved precision targeting and fire control solutions. Automatic target cueing systems can benefit from fused and electro-optic data, resulting in higher confidence and detection rates with lower false alarms. Enhanced aspect missiles could be employed using trackfiles derived from fused offensive sensors, defensive sensors, and wingman trackfiles. Within this broad area of fusion for tracking, sensor management and weapon delivery, there are two major areas we wish to focus on. The first area of interest involves fusion for air-to-ground precision targeting. Emerging inertial aided munitions will rely on on-board sensors and off-board assets to derive precision target locations. Algorithms that have the capability to integrate information from Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) systems, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), Global Positioning System (GPS), and off-board information should greatly enhance the capabilities of attack aircraft. Specific areas of interest include the ability to direct, prioritize, and schedule available sensors, perform on-board fusion of information derived by the sensors and off-board assets, and utilize the fused information to develop an improved fire control solution. The second area of interest involves the integration and fusion of offensive sensors, defensive sensors, and wingman trackfiles to obtain the integrated picture of the environment and to coordinate these sensors throughout an air-to-air engagement. The algorithms should coordinate all functions performed by the aircraft: offensive, defensive, navigation, and threat assessment. The overall objective is automated all-aspect coverage by an integrated sensor suite enabling all-aspect weapon delivery. This capability will increase survivability, flexibility, and situational awareness while reducing pilot workload. Primary issues are conflicting timelines between different sensors, changing mission goals, latency of internetted tracks, and accuracy of fire control solutions. This program will build on recent advancements in enhanced aspect sensors, advanced missile control, datalinks, navigation systems, high angle-of-arrival radar warning receivers, and advanced warning systems.

Phase II: The contractor shall implement the selected algorithms and perform detailed evaluation and demonstration of their performance.

The acquisition of low observable (LO) threats, by both ground-based and airborne radar systems operating in the VHF through L-Band frequency regions, in these difficult interference environments would not generally be possible at militarily useful ranges using conventional techniques. However, state-of-the-art adaptive sidelobe canceler (ASLC) and space-time adaptive processing (STAP) systems' target angle estimation accuracy can be degraded for two main reasons; 1) limited signal-to-interference ratios due to radar implementation and scenario factors including terrain scattered jamming interference entering the radar antenna's main beam and sidelobes, and 2) distortion of the adapted monopulse antenna patterns when encountering main or near-main beam jamming. These degraded radar angle measurement accuracies may be incompatible with achieving the required weapons systems fire control operations. Examples include the inability of a ground-based GCI radar to vector a fighter out to intercept a threat and achieving the air-intercept missile midcourse guidance that assures terminal guidance seeker target acquisition in light of the reduced seeker acquisition ranges associated with the LO threat signatures. Therefore, new adaptive processing radar architectures are being sought that afford the potential of measuring target range, Doppler, azimuth and elevation angles with the accuracies that are consistent with establishing track files for effective fire control. Phase I: Will formulate and predict the performance, using digital computer radar and environmental simulations, of innovative adaptive processing approaches whose threat state space measurement accuracies are consistent with counter LO missile fire control. Low frequency linear arrays employing element and beam space configurations, ASLC, and STAP techniques are among the architectural features to be considered.

It can also be used as a rescue radio for downed pilot location and communication, a covert beacon for drop site/plane crash location, a covert rendezvous and a refueling coordination radio by Special Operations Forces (SOF), a covert station keeping data link by SOF, and a covert situational awareness and coordination data by Air Combat Command (ACC). Phase I: The contractor shall design a WCAR to satisfy both the wind dropsonde simplex data link requirement and an air-to-air two way communications and relative location requirement. The contractor shall also analyzes the WCAR design to determine its theoretical performance and unit cost. Phase II: The contractor shall develop, test, and evaluate two simplex transmit wind dropsonde WCAR terminals and four air-to-air two-way WCAR terminals, which were designed in Phase I. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: This WCAR technology is directly applicable to the development of police, FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, and other law enforcement agencies' radios.

Carrier phase tracking algorithms can produce position accuracies on the order of 3-5 centimeters assuming that the phase ambiguity can be resolved correctly. At present, this capability exists in real-time for static or low dynamic applications, but not for high dynamic environments such as a fighter aircraft may experience. In high dynamic environments, carrier phase tracking is not always maintained which prevents one from resolving phase ambiguities real-time to determine position accurately. This effort would develop real-time ambiguity resolution algorithms for high dynamic applications. Phase I: The contractor would first develop algorithms for real-time ambiguity resolution assuming that carrier tracking is maintained. These algorithms would then be improved to perform real-time ambiguity resolution for the case where carrier tracking is lost for various periods of time. The algorithm performance shall be validated using high fidelity computer simulations, and, if applicable, actual data collected from flight instrumentation. An evaluation will be made of the computational efficiency of the algorithms. The contractor will provide documentation of all algorithm development details and performance results achieved. Phase II: The contractor shall implement the real-time ambiguity resolution algorithms in Ada and using actual GPS hardware demonstrate their performance in a high dynamic environment. The validation of the algorithms will require the development of a highly accurate time, space and position information (TSPI) system capable of cm position accuracy and velocity of 0.01 fps. The developed TSPI will be applied in a series of flight tests to demonstrate the real-time performance of the developed algorithms. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: These algorithms have tremendous commercial application in the areas of kinematic surveying, test reference for system validation, and commercial aviation. By developing a real-time cm position accuracy capability, surveys can be accomplished in less time resulting in a tremendous savings.

Modern aircraft design practices tend to minimize the profile, induced and compressibility drag components by sizing the aircraft for specific mission needs. The friction and interference drag components are not as easily controlled in the design process; however, these drag components can be markedly reduced by the practical application of innovative active drag reduction devices. Recent skin friction drag reduction technology, such as the government sponsored laminar flow control flight experiments, have shown that the pneumatic control of aircraft skin friction drag can have a major impact on aircraft range improvement. The next big strides in skin friction and interference drag improvement can be made by linking microprocessors with aerodynamic boundary layer control devices to optimize flow control on or near the aircraft surface. The development and application of properly controlled active boundary layer and/or separated flow control devices offers the potential for dramatically improving the range of military aircraft. Also, the technology developed is directly applicable to commercial aircraft.

Once chemical replacements are identified and implemented, further advances in aircraft on-board fire protection technologies will be difficult to implement in future aircraft applications. Fewer new aircraft will be built due to worldwide budget constraints, and existing aircraft already featuring fire protection systems will have extended service lives. New technologies proposed to replace existing systems on these aircraft must overcome initial substantial retrofit costs and unit costs to fare favorably in cost-benefit analyses. Recent advances in fire protection capability lessen the need to expand the fire suppression performance envelope as much as to provide lower cost of ownership for such protection. Life cycle costs for weapons systems and subsystems and the cost reductions new technologies provide will dictate which technologies will be retrofit in the future. This effort is thus oriented to identify and evaluate innovative concepts to provide lower life cycle cost requirements than currently required for existing aircraft fire protection requirements. These innovations can include modifications to existing maintenance and operational procedures, modifications to existing fire suppression and/or detection systems, or entirely new system components. These concepts will be technically evaluated based upon their low risk, life cycle cost savings and return on investment period, including the retrofit costs required. Low cost systems with minimal aircraft modifications will thus be heavily favored under such criteria. It is estimated that savings of 10% or more on life cycle costs may be sufficient to warrant retrofit actions in some applications. Rough estimates of life cycle cost reductions and return on investment period, with rationale and assumptions in the estimates included, shall be required in the proposals to allow proper evaluations and demonstrate technical competence.

Aircraft prototype hardware will be assembled and demonstrated for performance at Wright Laboratory test facilities. Additional demonstration tests for operational suitability shall be performed. If only a procedure is proposed actual field tests will be performed at an air base wing to validate the procedure.

Numerous methods are available to reduce these losses; however, the need for more innovative and effective methods remain. Infrasounds (sounds below 16 Hz) are emitted from natural sources such as mountain ranges, earthquakes, thunderstorms, auroras, and oceans (Kreithen and Quine 1979). It is hypothesized that birds use this sensitivity for navigational purposes. The possibility of ascertaining and reproducing natural avoidance responses of birds to mechanically replicable frequencies of infrasound may prove it as a potential method to substantially reduce the bird/aircraft strike hazard. Phase I: Characterize the responses of samples of a gull species, raptor species, and waterfowl species to a range of infrasounds. Identify mechanically replicable infrasound frequencies which will invoke an avoidance response by at least two of the three species researched.

Sandwich structure (or cored composite) is a leading concept for weight reduction. The majority of sandwich structure on Air Force aircraft involves a honeycomb core with adhesively bonded facesheets. Although lightweight, conventional cored composites are not only costly to fabricate, and inherently vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats. Microflaws allow moisture laden air to enter and condense within the part. Internal corrosion, together with frequent disbonds between skin and core, lead to drastic performance changes for parts which are either stiffness critical or have dielectric functions. As a result, repair and replacement of these honeycomb components are frequent. There is a need to develop a durable, low cost, weight competitive alternative to adhesively bonded honeycomb sandwich structure. Organic foam cores can be molecularly bonded to the skins and therefore eliminate the cost and weight associated with relatively weak adhesive bondlines. Some concepts allow for fabrication of the entire sandwich component in onestep. This not only eliminates the need for expensive machining, but results in a part which is dimensionally perfect. The closed-cell nature of organic foam cores precludes moisture absorption and corrosion. Foam cores and stronger skin-core interfaces also have the potential for significant improvements in impact resistance. Although foam cores demonstrate several desirable qualities (all leading to reduced R&M requirements), their shear and compression properties are not presently weight competitive with honeycomb. Overcoming this deficiency is the goal of this program. To make foam cored composites weight competitive with honeycomb composites, the density of current foam has to be reduced from present levels to as little as 6 to 11 lbs/ft3. This must be achieved while maintaining specific shear strengths of 60 to 80 psi/(lb/ft3) under hot/wet conditions of 250.F and 95% relative humidity. Phase I: Composite sandwich structures of various concepts (having thicknesses ranging from 0.25 to 1.00 inch) will be fabricated, environmentally conditioned (to include solvents), and subjected to shear and compression tests. Goals of the effort will be weight gains (due to moisture absorption) of less than 1% while maintaining strength requirements under hot/wet conditions. Phase II: Composite sandwich structure concepts having acceptable properties and minimal weight gains (as identified in Phase I) will be scaled up and subjected to advanced environmental, strength, damage resistance, and damage tolerance testing. The goal of the effort will be to identify concepts which meet R&M 2000 requirements. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: Foam cored composite materials are suitable for nearly any commercial application where structural rigidity is required.

In performing this operation, it is desirable to remove the man from the location of the ordnance and to automate some of the process of removal.

A major trend in compression system hardware is the increased utilization of low-aspect ratio blading, solid or hollow blisks, and three-dimensional design methodology. The primary and secondary flow system design capability which is currently two-dimensional must be extended fully into three dimensions to adequately exploit these trends. Adequate documentation of this work and its influence on turbomachinery is needed as a comprehensive background document on turbomachinery. Areas of prime technical importance include blade/vane sweep, shock/boundary layer interaction, forced response and mistuning in compression systems, secondary flow design, time unsteady features of the turbomachinery gas path, and secondary flow systems. Areas of particular interest in secondary flow design include counter-rotation, trenching, brush seals, and disk pumping in regions as far back in the engine as the turbine shroud area.

Both concepts combine the flexibility and efficiency of turbomachinery at flight speeds of Mach 0 to 4 with the simplicity, low weight, and high specific impulse of the ramjet in the Mach 3 to 6 flight range. Currently, plans are underway to develop technologies for both a turboramjet and an air turborocket under the High Mach Turbine Engine Technologies (HiMATE) program. Under this program, technologies which would be applicable to either cycle are of primary interest. The proposal must demonstrate an understanding of the HiMATE program and its goals.

Proof-of-concept testing is preferred, but analytical investigations will also be considered. Phase I: The goals of Phase I will be to identify a novel concept, quantify its payoff, and conduct a small-scale experiment to demonstrate concept feasibility. If a strictly analytical approach is proposed, sufficient analysis must be performed to demonstrate some degree of concept feasibility and plan experiments for Phase II.

A number of component technologies need to be developed for such propulsion systems, the most critical being the exhaust nozzle. The nozzle will have to operate over a broad range of temperatures and pressures and accommodate expansion ratios as high as 40 to 1. The high temperatures associated with Mach 6 flight lead to dissociation in the combustor, and the lack of recombination of the exhaust products in the nozzle can result in losses in overall performance. Studies have shown that a 1-percent drop in gross-thrust coefficient can result in an 8-percent reduction in net thrust and a significant rise in vehicle takeoff weight. Accurate measurements of temperature and velocity profiles and recombination rates in Mach 4 to 6 nozzles are needed to upgrade kinetics codes and develop design methodologies for high performance exhaust nozzles. Although a number of instrumentation techniques have been and are currently being developed to measure temperatures, velocities and species, these technologies have generally not been applied to Mach 4 to 6 exhaust nozzles at realistic operating conditions. Under this program, innovative advanced instrumentation systems are sought to measure temperatures, species, and velocities profiles in supersonic exhaust nozzles operating at conditions commensurate with Mach 6 flight speeds. Emphasis should be on obtaining data useful for kinetics model development. Both nonintrusive and intrusive techniques for use in a test cell environment rather than a bench top basic research experiment are of interest.

Past ATR research has proposed the novel concept to use a turbocompressor monorotor composed of fan blades outside to the central ring and of turbine blades inside to the central ring. This monorotor concept could propel an ATR more efficiently due to potential weight and volume savings and more economically due to simple injection-molding manufacturing. The program demonstrates the viability of a monorotor-powered ATR and determines its operating conditions/limitations. Phase I: Phase I would include as many of the following tasks as possible: literature search to ascertain previous relevant work; conceptual design of a monorotor ATR, and determination of its operational envelope; recommendation of an easy-to-handle and environmentally-clean (possibly solid) propellant; illustration, including weight and dimension estimates of all key ATR components, showing integration of monorotor in the ATR; computer cycle prediction of the monorotor ATR performance; survey of possible materials (metals, ceramics, and composites) used to manufacture the monorotor and bearings; preliminary harmonic (Campbell diagram) and vibratory stress analysis (Goodman diagram) to verify design integrity; test plan development for Phase II work. Phase II: Phase II work would include a more in-depth analysis to accomplish these tasks and the fabrication, spin testing, and fuel-powered operation of a suitable monorotor for the ATR. This effort should be a simple and low cost demonstration of the monorotor ATR over the defined performance envelope. The demonstrator ATR could be a subscale prototype but should maximize usage of ""off-the-shelf"" components. The demonstrator must include the monorotor, combustion chamber, fuel delivery system, nozzle, and a means to start and to throttle the engine. The demonstrator should potentially average a minimum specific impulse (thrust/fuel massflow rate) of 600 seconds throughout the envelope. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: The potential success of this dual-use technology would revolutionize turbocompressor manufacturing for both the military and commercial sectors. A new commercial product (innovative turbomachinery) easier and cheaper to make would show its worth. Several commercial applications are foreseen.

These processes should occur very rapidly so that the combustor operation is stable and efficient over a wide range of fuel and air flow rates, consume all the fuel, can be easily ignited at ground and altitude conditions, have an acceptable temperature profile at the combustor exit, and are suitable for the development of a low specific fuel consumption and high thrust-to-weight ratio engine. These characteristics must be achieved in such a way that pollutant emissions of nitric oxides, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons, and soot are low at all conditions and the combustor is affordable, has high reliability, and has a long operating life without maintenance. Innovative combustor concepts are sought that will improve performance in gas turbine combustors. Such concepts might include catalytic combustion, methods for rapid atomization and mixing of fuel and air, ways of converting liquid hydrocarbon fuel to gaseous or supercritical fuels in the fuel system, and techniques for efficient injection and burning of these fluids in the combustor.

This effort will form a core of mission area assessments (MAA), mission needs analysis (MNA) and cost and operational effectiveness analyses (COEA) tools for acquisition of future theater airlift systems and concepts. Key to this capability is a validated campaign-level model which incorporates theater airlift systems, concepts, and technologies in conjunction with airland battles, and surface logistics transportation. Supporting tools and models may be necessary to assess the impact of airlift factors at the mission level to provide data for the campaign-level analysis. Examples of airlift factors are airlifter characteristics, command and control capability, material handling capability and maintenance and ground support capability. The principal focus on this modeling capability is to provide insight into the impact of theater airlift on warfighting effectiveness. The methodology, with varied databases, can provide a capability for commercial aviation assessment of productivity, cost and efficiency. The effort will begin with a study of the analysis requirements and an identification of the key processes to be modeled. These processes must be documented in a flowchart with narrative. The second task will construct a comprehensive approach for analyzing theater airlift capability and its impact on war fighting effectiveness.

Currently a combination of Fluropenetrant Inspection (FPI) and Eddy Current (EC) techniques are used to perform these inspections. The major drawbacks of both of these inspections systems are that parts must be cleaned to an ""as new"" condition, the FPI process is labor intensive, and EC is slow. The cleaning process itself is a labor intensive effort. In addition, numerous hazard substances are currently used in this process. The use of these chemicals will be prohibited in the future, and we need to be able to reduce our usage of them in the near term. There are several new inspection technologies, such as Magneto Optic Eddy Current Imaging and Laser Holography, that may be able to inspect the parent metal in the part without cleaning the part. The major difficulties with the inspection of engine parts is the flaw-size inspection requirements and the complex geometries of the parts.

Considerable effort is still being put forth by the military to develop new explosives or formulations with increased performance, e.g. increased blast or detonation pressures. While new materials are being developed and some increases in performance are being achieved, only minor progress is being made in the environmental areas of demilitarization and hazardous waste reduction. Commercial explosives, on the other hand, usually do not exhibit properties that are considered compatible with military objectives or safety requirements, e.g. long shelf-life, small critical diameter and high performance. Examples of these explosives are the aqueous emulsions used primarily by the mining industry. The primary goal of this program is to develop a new energetic material or formulation that exhibits the performance and safety properties required by the military, is suitable for use by both the military and industry, can be produced relatively cheaply in non-specialized (commercial) facilities, and that is easily demilitarized and rendered inert with minimal effect on the environment. Phase I of this program includes small scale characterization tests on selected formulations and selection of two or more formulations for further testing in Phase II. Areas of importance for this initial selection are cost of materials, production characteristics associated with ingredients, formulation and demilitarization issues, hazardous waste minimization, and predicted performance characteristics. Phase II of this program will demonstrate the usefulness of selected formulations to the military and industry through appropriate testing. All issues are to be addressed including performance, safety, shelf-life, cost, producibility, and environmental concerns.

Simultaneously, efforts to miniaturize high speed, high resolution charge coupled device imagers for aircraft and weapon testing have resulted in a need to transmit the resulting high bandwidth data. In all cases, encryption is a driving requirement, implying that the analog video and FPA data be digitized. Efficient use of the telemetry transmission spectrum is also a driver, suggesting that unique data compression and modulation techniques be applied to decrease transmission bandwidth while maintaining image quality. Several levels of quality must be defined, each dependent upon the specific application. Real-time compression (lossless and lossy) and transmission is also a requirement for some applications. This entire functionality must be developed, then miniaturized to be captured entirely within a monolithic chip-set that will integrate and function with the subminiature telemetry chip-set.

Projectile velocities vary from Mach 0.4 to Mach l0. A significant amount of data is lost and substantial damage to the ballistic range occurs due to poor sabot separation from the projectile. Experience has shown that some sabot designs work well at high velocities but perform poorly at low velocities. No criteria allowing the test engineer to properly match launch environment to sabot design presently exist. Although literature discussing sabot design for various applications exists, no systematic literature review and distillation of sabot design principles has been done. A handbook detailing sabot design principles for a wide range of launchers and launch velocities would formalize what is presently a trial and error process. Successful definition of sabot design principles could reduce lost data and prevent projectile damage to range equipment. Phase I includes an in-depth search for sabot designs required to identify concepts for aeroballistic testing. As a result of this search a preliminary set of design guidelines will be determined. Phase II includes building and testing various sabot designs to validate preliminary design guidelines developed in Phase I.

This data fusion technique leads to a new system that fuses the sensor observations before declaring a detection and provides for full integration of each sensor observation.

Similar improvements are anticipated for raw data fusing of active RF microwave and millimeter wave sensors. Present solutions to overcome these difficulties are too inflexible to be generally adaptable to a large number of scenarios and applications.

Typical examples for the latter purpose are zirconium, both sponge and liners, titanium sponge, mischmetal liners and depleted uranium follow-through. Aluminum additive reacts with an oxidizing medium, e.g. detonation products, oxygen in the air or, perhaps, oxidizing functional groups associated with the explosive fill, to tailor the rate of energy delivery by the expanding detonation gases. Success in both blast-type and incendiary areas has been achieved, the degree of which depending on specific goals. The formation of aluminum oxide (Al203) is extremely exothermic and can effectively be used to increase the temperature of the expanding detonation products and influence the distribution of the equilibrium products. A detrimental aspect in using aluminum is that the oxide coating associated with each particle does not slough off with increasing thickness. The primary goal of this effort is to develop an explosive fill incorporating particulate metal that provides improved air blast, cratering, or heave properties over those of existing explosives. Sensitivity to shock, fragment or flyer plate-like impact and those forces associated with hard target penetration must be minimized. Phase I would include a comprehensive search for candidate energetic materials/formulations that will cause the complete and rapid oxidation of incorporated particulate metal during detonation. This search should cover a range of conditions that may provide insight into the effective use of metal as an air-blast, cratering, or heave enhancing agent when incorporated into a specially designed explosive. Initial syntheses of new energetic materials with the predetermined characteristics should be formulated. Environmentally friendly materials and procedures must be utilized during this development and environmentally sound demilitarization procedures should be proposed. Phase II would include synthesis/formulation work and the necessary testing to verify the new explosive as having improved blast/cratering/heaving characteristics. Issues to be addressed include performance, sensitivity, and environmental soundness.

For example, strain hardening that occurs during tantalum liner production is known to have significant effect on the formation behavior of the warhead. If we are to understand the strain hardening process that occurs during penetrator formation, it is absolutely necessary to understand manufacturing processes. The scope of this work effort should be restricted to copper and tantalum.

Overall sensor performance could be increased with improved optical filter/detector combinations that have more desirable operating characteristics. Optical bandpass filters are used to limit the amount of background energy that can impinge the detector elements. Two considerations when using these devices are the diode laser frequency change versus temperature and the acceptance angle of the received energy. Diode laser devices have a significant center frequency shift versus temperature when compared to the ideal bandpass filter required to optimize system signal-to-noise ratio. Active temperature control of the diode lasers is not an option; therefore, the device needed is a bandpass filter or filter/avalanche photodetector combination that can be configured to track the frequency changes of the diode laser versus temperature. A passive technique would be preferred, but active techniques that could be operational at fuze power-up (less than 50 microseconds) would be acceptable. The final technique needs to work with diode lasers that range from 800-970 nanometer wavelength and should be no larger than current interference filter techniques. Although the current acceptance angle of interference filters is adequate, a device with a larger acceptance angle would also be preferred.

The complexity of targets, weapon delivery conditions, and a broad range of kill mechanisms lead to very large numbers of vulnerability/lethality assessments that must be performed to accurately quantify the effectiveness of a weapon or system. Presently, the Warheads Branch of the Wright Laboratory Armament Directorate has a study underway that requires 500,000 individual sub-simulations on four computers over eighteen months. The results of the vulnerability assessments are required in the weapon design/redesign process. This can only occur if the assessments are run in a timely manner. Recent developments in the computer industry might be applied to reduce vulnerability assessment run times and thus affect design decisions.

Prior to the past decade it made little sense to attempt to do so, since it was thought that the individual cells themselves had to be vented; they were neither sealed nor maintenance-free. Having overcome this restriction, the present issue is how to fabricate anode and cathode back-to-back for a high energy density battery of a desired voltage. The two-terminal, or bipolar battery design must be extremely rugged and offer relatively high energy density. In addition, it must have a high degree of rechargeability and be well-suited to -55 degree centigrade operation for weapons application.

ESS consists of functionally testing electronic hardware while applying environmental temperature or vibration stresses that simulate actual operating conditions. Currently, complex and specialized Automated Test Equipment (ATE) are the electronic stimulus and measurement equipment that functionally test these Units Under Test (UTTS). During the ESS test troubleshooting process, there are instances where this specialized ATE can fault isolate only to a group of components within the CCA. There exists Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) ATE that can provide functional and in circuit testing of CCAs. The following requirements are needed in order to utilize COTS ATE board/component level testers in the ESS vibration and temperature testing of CCAs: (1) capability to satisfactorily perform board level and component level testing at the operating frequency range of current applications (50 MHz maximum) and for future applications (200 MHz maximum). (2) capability to perform functional (board level) testing and in circuit (component level) testing, both with learning capability. (3) capability to properly interface the CCA to the COTS ATE and COTS ESS hardware during ESS testing without affecting performance measurement testing of the CCA, while providing the above board level and component level testing requirements. Phase I will determine the feasibility of adapting and developing interface requirements and test procedures for a jet engine controller digital microprocessor CCA of medium frequency range (less than 20 MHz) operating with and existing Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) COTS digital tester and existing GFE COTS ESS hardware and identify those COTS tester and ESS hardware and interface requirements with the greatest potential success for current (50 MHz maximum) and future (200 MHz maximum) applications.

Composite material costs are very high (greater than $20 per pound in the raw state and as much as $1000 per pound in a finished product). If the curing process fails, the composite must be scrapped. The development of using fiber optics in conjunction with Fourier Transform Near Infrared Raman spectroscopy is needed to allow the actual monitoring of the chemical reactions within the composite material during the cure process. If an optical fiber can be inserted into the raw composite material, then the Raman spectrum could be accumulated in real time, thereby increasing material cure reliability and efficiency. This remote sensing technique could be used to monitor the material while curing which laboratory. Thus, provide a chemical characterization of the material while curing which would eliminate the high costs resulting from scrapping material due to improper curing.

One of the main sources of Signal Propagation Errors in Anechoic Chambers are multipath reflections from Radar Absorbing Material. Multipath errors in signal propagation are the result of forward an/or back-scattered signal propagation paths that deviate from the direct path of propagation. When these signals combine together, they may interfere constructively or destructively with the direct path signal. There is a need to develop a methodology or technique to reduce these errors.

Of primary interest is the development of coatings that do not contain isocyanate compounds and are equal to or exceed the performance of Military Specifications, Mil-C-83286. The coating must meet low VOC and IR requirements. The application of these coatings are to include the initial coating procedures and any touch-up. This coating must be able to be applied to aircraft, aircraft ground support equipment and other Air Force equipment. Phase I: Phase I will address initial formulation, fabrication, evaluation, and application techniques of specific subjects for proof on concept. Phase II: Phase II will further develop and optimize the material and/or application techniques, and produce larger samples for a full spectrum of evaluations.

There is a need for a system that provides early warning of potential seal failures for compressors, valves, pumps, flanges, and other piping facilities which might cause fugitive emissions. Phase I: Phase I would be to develop a system design specification and to perform preliminary requirement allocation and design for pumps, valves, and flanges that would meet the Federal and California Regulations. Federal Regulation 40 CFR Chapter 1, issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act, requires compressors, valves, pumps, and other piping facilities which might create fugitive emissions to be monitored on a regular basis with appropriate reporting and penalties for excessive failure. In California, even stiffer requirements and penalties (S.C.A.Q.M.D. Rule 1173) are being adopted and other areas are to follow. Present regulations dictate the use of continuous monitoring of seals to detect early failure. A superior system would detect incipient failure and give an electrical, visual, and/or audio signal of a potential problem. This would allow time for preventive action prior to any emission taking place. Detector systems must consider fire, wide temperature excursions, and wide ranging internal/external environments. They should be compatible to the maximum extent possible with existing flange, pump, and valve designs. In addition, they should be more economic than existing monitoring systems. Phase II: Phase II would provide the risk assessment, develop a prototype design, testing requirements, and perform laboratory and/or field demonstration tests to insure the proposed design works and interfaces with existing piping and equipment.

This work supports, in large part, Air Force compliance with federal, state and local regulations governing environmental, safety, and occupational health, e.g. OSHA, AFOSH, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, RCRA, ATSDR, etc. The work is accomplished through seven functional areas: (1) Analytical Chemistry Services provides support to Air Force environmental pollution control programs. They respond to over 250 base level customers who send over 100,000 samples annually. Novel approaches to measuring and analyzing exposure to hazardous materials in air, water, soil, and vegetation (occupational and environmental applications) are sought. (2) Research and development activities for Bioenvironmental Engineering Services support environmental monitoring and compliance technologies for noise, ionizing and nonionizing radiation, toxic emissions into air, water, and soil, and hazardous material handling and abatement. (3) Occupational Medicine requires the ability to rapidly access health hazard information and to employ modern methods for exposure estimation to conduct occupational and environmental hazard assessments. (4) Optical Radiation Division conducts research on high energy density visible light, with special requirements in laser bioeffects and laser eye protection. (5) The Radiofrequency Radiation Division conducts research on the bioeffects of radiofrequency and microwave radiation with requirements in central nervous system effects at the cellular level. (6) The Mathematics Division conducts research on the analytical and modeling aspects of biomedical hazards of directed energy with requirements in tissue level interactions. (7) Toxicology research investigates the hazards of Air Force chemicals and materials on humans and the environment with requirements in tissue dose estimation and injury mechanisms for hazard analyses. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: The scope of work of the Occupational and Environmental Health Directorate impacts areas of interest that qualified small businesses work in. e.g., all human centered technology assessments to create a safer work place for Air Force personnel as well as determinations for the general public that the Air Force is a non-polluting ""good neighbor.""
