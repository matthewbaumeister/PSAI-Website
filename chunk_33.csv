Existing methods for excitation are either frequency limited, amplitude limited or the excitation system itself causes a samped response.

These can come down much slower and result in a glancing blow with the ground instead of a direct hit and almost totally eliminates injuries from impact. The problem is to make a square canopy that can be deployed at ejection seat speeds without failing, that will fit in the current allowed space for the round canopy.

When a device is broken, the Automatic Test System (ATS) is connected to the device, and a Test Program Set (TPS) program developed to test and diagnose failures on that device is executed on the computer. The TPS tells the instruments what kind of signals, power, etc. to input to the device and what signals to measure. Based on the measurements made, the TPS is suppose to determine what needs to be repaired or replaced on the device being tested. The problem with Automatic Test programming is that it tends to be much more complex than ""regular"" programming. When programming for PCs, the computer industry has well established standards so that software does not have to care who made a sound card or a CD drive. In ATS programming, the commands sent to similar instruments to stimulate or measure are usually not the same, if the instruments were made by different manufacturers. This means that every time an ATS is upgraded with new instruments, all the TPSs may need to be modified. The test industry is just now coming out with standards that will fix this, so that there will be less dependency between the TPS and the instruments on the tester. These standards will essentially ""decouple"" the TPS from the ATS configuration. Such standards will enable the DoD to save billions of dollars that would have been required to modify or rehost TPSs. Another aspect of TPS programming that makes it more complex is that in most DoD generated TPSs, the diagnostics are part of the TPS. What this means is that the TPS has decision points based on which tests passed or failed, to try to narrow down to one or a few components where the product has a fault and needs repair. Putting these decision points in the TPS makes the TPS very complex, driving up their development and maintenance costs. If a test instrument is changed or not available, the product modified, or if it is learned that the original TPS held some decision paths that were not correct, the TPS would need to be modified. With the convoluted decision paths in a TPS, this is not an inexpensive or error free process. What is needed is a way to ""decouple"" the tests from the diagnostics, so that simple TPS tests can be executed with the decision logic in a separate program. Another benefit from this decoupling is that different diagnostic approaches can be used: decision trees, fuzzy logic, neural networks, etc.; whatever is most effective. The TPS tests would also be smaller and more modular, so that a change in one test is much less likely to cause errors to propagate through the rest of the program. AI-ESTATE is the only industry standard that has been developed to address this expensive problem of diagnostics being embedded with TPSs. There are proprietary diagnostic test products available, but their unique data formats and software interfaces essentially lock the user into one way of doing things. With the DoD actively moving towards open system architectures in commercial products (primarily to avoid being locked into certain products and to allow flexibility in implementation), prototyping and creating an AI-ESTATE diagnostic tool is a natural extension of this policy into the problems associated with diagnositics and Automatic Test.",564,3343,1,No,No,No,,"Research and develop an approach to integrate a diagnostic reasoner capability, based on AI-ESTATE standards, into a mainstream commercial test programming environment. Contractor will develop the system specification for the diagnostic reasoner. The reasoner must be capable of interfacing and interoperating with LabView, LabWindows and/or HPVEE. This may require establishing agreements with the manufacturers of these tools to enable modifications to accommodate a true AI- ESTATE compliant interface. The reasoner must be compliant with IEEE standards 1232, 1232.1 and P1232.2. If IEEE 1232.2 is not yet published as an IEEE standard the reasoner must be compliant with the most current draft available from the standards development group. The reasoner must be extendible to enable the addition of new diagnostic models, including the use of neural networks and fuzzy logic. The reasoner must have a graphical interface compatible with VXI Plug & Play and industry standards, to ensure the interface is intuitive and has a reduced learning curve to begin application. The reasoner will have a model development environment enabling the development, modification and maintenance of the diagnostic models. The environment shall preferably be implemented via Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tools such as Visual Basic or Visual C++. A LabView or LabWindows prototype of the reasoner will be demonstrated with a test program of medium complexity; the Test Program Sets (TPS) may be based on an existing test program modified for the demonstration. The intent of the demonstration is to validate the ""look and feel"" of the reasoner interface; therefore it does not have to be a full implementation of the AI-ESTATE services. PHASE II: 1.) Produce a working tool: a. Develop a diagnostic reasoner with full implementation of the AI-ESTATE standards. The contractor should be able to show direct traceability of the reasoner services and exchange formats to the AI-ESTATE standards. b.

The contractor shall allow incremental releases of the tool to the government for review and feedback on its interface and capabilities.",,"This test tool has the potential of greatly increasing the flexibility of the test program developer, by extracting the diagnostics from the test program into a separate diagnostic reasoner. This capability greatly reduces the complexity of the test program, enables greater reuse of test program modules, and enables growth of a test program's diagnostic capability through enhancements of the reasoner model rather than modifying the test program.

Physical properties testing such as flash point, viscosity, density, fuel dilution, water, and total acid number requires time, varied laboratory apparatus and reagents, trained technicians, and off-line analysis. Recent developments (1,2,3) in Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) have made many aspects of oil condition monitoring as quick and easy as AES. Problems and limitations such as insensitivity to low water levels and solvent usage still exist and should be addressed in this effort to advance the Raman analytical technology. Recent technological advances in holographic filters and gratings, Charge Couple Device (CCD) detectors, and diode pumped lasers (4,5,6) have made Raman spectroscopic measurements routine and convenient. The availability of commercial off- the-shelf process monitors (7) based on Raman spectroscopy indicates that alternatives to FT-IR and physical properties testing of turbine oil condition may be feasible. An in- situ Raman spectroscopy-based system with no moving parts, the capability of sampling through containers, transparent access ports, or via fiber optics, and measurements of vibrational frequencies that depend on different selection rules than FT-IR could advance oil condition monitoring technology. The Raman technique can utilize either an interferometer (FT-Raman) with a moving mirror or a dispersive holographic transmission grating (8) with no moving parts. This research should include but not be limited to (a) investigations of turbine oil Raman emissions with emphasis on laser wavelength selection to maximize response and minimize fluorescence, (b) correlation of FT-IR frequency bands of interest with Raman emission lines [ hydrogen bonded O-H, free O-H, single bridge O-H, C-O, C=O, C-O-C, P-O, S-O, and N-O vibrational frequency correlations ], (c) laser power stabilization, (d) laser wavelength stabilization (mode hopping) (9), (e) spectrometer wavelength calibration - Raman shift scale (10,11,12), (f) CCD A/D intensity calibration (g), sampling geometry (direct coupling vs. fiber optics), (h) spectrometer design: interferometer vs. grating instrument.",339,2423,1,No,No,No,,"Assess the viability of Raman spectroscopy as an analytical technique for monitoring the condition of in-use turbine oils.

Recent advances in high power electronics, new magnetic bearings, and technological research in composite materials have revolutionized the capabilities of flywheel based energy storage systems. These breakthroughs have enabled numerous small businesses to start development of smaller, faster, and more efficient (approaching 90%) flywheel energy storage systems. All communication, command and control, radar, and information systems contain sensitive electronic equipment which must be protected against power quality problems. With deployable equipment, the shelter manufacturing facilities have incorporated UPS and batteries to increase power reliability to the sensitive electronic equipment. After manufacturing, these shelters are scattered to different military units in all corners of the world. They sit waiting to be deployed in support of the US military and NATO forces. The type of UPS used in these shelters must withstand long periods of no charge, be able to charge fully in a timely manner, and be able to function in a wide variety of temperatures and climates. Permanent facilities located in harsh environments also must be provided quality power. With all of this in mind, alternatives to battery-based UPS must be developed and tested. Most power quality problems last less than 30 seconds, which is the maximum time it takes to get a ""fast start"" backup generator on line. A capability to carry through short term power sags and outages, as well a capability to hold a load until a generator can come on line, is needed.

Some of the most complex parts are five-axis structural components. The surface geometry of these parts contains volumetric features such as slots, steps, blind holes, irregular cavities, bosses, protrusions, notches, and multiple edges. Production of these components is accomplished on Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machines. Prior to the machining process, a part program must be developed. This part program is created by developing a Computer Aided Design (CAD) surface or solid model from paper drawings. From this model, CNC tool paths are generated using Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software. The development of the solid model is an extensive and time consuming process. In some cases, an existing aircraft component can be obtained for inspection. Current technology is available to digitize (create the model) simple components through the use of a coordinate measuring machine, x-ray computed tomography, and laser scanning. These methods, however, are unable to create a model for complex, five-axis structural components. If these methods could be expanded, or a new approach was developed to accomplish this task, the time required for model production of complex parts would be greatly reduced. The intent of this research and development effort is to develop a system capable of digitizing the surfaces of an actual aircraft component and creating a digital CAD model from it. This process would not require the use of engineering drawings or loft data. After creation of the CAD model, the system will coordinate with the CAM software currently in place at WR-ALC to generate tool paths for the CNC machines. The developed system must allow design changes to be made to the CAD model prior to generating the tool paths.

In this context, the term visibility relates to the ability of imaging sensors to ""see"" objects at long ranges. Advanced knowledge of current visibility conditions across a broad frequency spectrum could be very useful in improving (or maintaining) the robustness of the test-data collection process. The ability to capture high-quality, high-resolution, performance data using film-based cinetheodolites and electro-optical sensors is often difficult to achieve because of degraded visibility at sensor and emitter operating wavelengths (400nm-12um). The quality of data collected during a test is often unknown until processing is performed after the event. If the data is unusable, the test may have to be rerun. Because of high costs associated with live testing, attempts have been made to predict visibility using the human eye. But, this method has proven to be operationally unsuitable due to optical differences between the human eye and the sensor optics as well as being highly subjective in nature. Several factors can effect visibility. Optical turbulence caused by surface heating is a major source of degradation. Sun angle, clouds, wind, haze, airborne particulate, and fog can contribute to poor visibility. Other factors also affecting visibility are the apparent size and features of the target, and the mission profile. Visibility is also affected by location, optics, and look angles of sensors. Weather conditions, which might vary depending on the sensor location, also affect visibility. The goal of the Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is to develop an affordable atmospheric visibility measurement capability to support range scheduling and test operations. This capability will predict the maximum resolution of targets ranging from small fighters and drones to large transport aircraft. Optical assets should be able to image targets within ten percent of predicted maximum range. The visibility information should be current and it should be presented in a form that highlights key situations and is easily understandable by range operations personnel.",343,2298,1,No,No,No,,Conduct a feasibility analysis and prepare a recommended system design.,"Develop and demonstrate a prototype system at the AFFTC, Edwards AFB, California.

MCT is an intrinsic detector, allowing operating temperature ranges rather than a fixed point operating temperature. The bandgap (and thus cutoff wavelength) is a function of composition, purity and temperature. This allows MCT crystals to absorb infrared radiation across most of the infrared spectrum, from the near visible to the very long wavelength region. In the short wavelength region, MCT is an environmentally acceptable material, demonstrated to operate in these wavelength regions at temperatures as high as room temperature (300K). In the mid wave region (2-5 microns), MCT absorbs relatively uniformly from 100K to 140K, which can be achieved by radiative cooling. In the long wave region (14-17 microns) MCT has been shown to operate at 40K and 77K. The challenge (which recent indications show can be overcome) of extending the wavelength further, comes through the control of : 1) extreme purity and 2) perceived instability of the mercury- telluride concentration required for such a narrow bandgap. The key to high precision focal plane components, displaying prescribed cutoff wavelengths, adequate yields to meet operability specifications, very low noise, large dynamic range, real time data processing, adequate radiation hardness, etc., lies on development of an innovative, extreme quality, small quantity, cost effective, MCT manufacturing process.",240,1630,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a process to produce a detector wafer in a short period of time, using only several grams of raw material.

The built in diagnostics can not indicate if the phase shifter is actually radiating, if it is in phase or its overall effect on antenna performance. If the fault can not be identified, the radar must be returned to the depot for repair. This is both costly and mandates deployment of sometimes unavailable spares.

The recent successes in micro-devices, such as fingernail-sized cameras, are leading to microspacecraft weighting as little as 5 kg. High-density digital electronics in smaller and smaller units translates into smaller and smaller space vehicles. However, no single factor constrains the design of space vehicles and the execution of their mission more than the state of art in propulsion technology. Micro-chemical propulsion can be used as a primary thrust system for orbit insertion, trajectory-control, and attitude control. Micro-electric propulsion may achieve some high delta-V maneuvers and attitude controls. Micro-thrusters based on sub-micron-scale and larger structures could produce impulse bits of less than 10-9 nanoseconds for precision thruster applications and could exploit non-conventional physical processes that occur at the sub-micron scale.

The objectives are cluster-built pulsed solid/gas propulsion systems, micro-ion, micro-pulsed plasma thrusters, micro-resistojets, and other possible alternatives. Scaling available thrusters to the required sizes presents several problems since most macroscopic physics do not apply at the non-continuum micron-level scales. For example, the breakdown voltage of micro-plasma is not known, nor is the gas flow behavior in micro-nozzles. Micro-nozzles suffer from boundary-layer effects which become more dominant as the local Reynolds number decreases. The Maxwell equations may not be valid at this scales.

Predicting the magnitude of that enhanced combat capability in quantitative terms remains a subjective art. It remains virtual guesswork to predict the relative warfighting benefits of one proposed technical advance compared to a competing one. The high cost of such advanced technology acquisition programs encourages the search for a more objective evaluation methodology. One promising alternative is combat simulation software which would permit the R&D acquisition decision maker to directly examine the simulated effect of the proposed innovation on modeled combat systems in realistic war scenarios. Such software could enable the user to adjust targeted performance characteristics to gauge which incremental technical improvements offer the highest combat-effectiveness payoffs.

Multi-spectral is meant to include polarimetric images within a single spectral band or non-image data that may be fused with image streams.,"Human capability for processing the ever-increasing volumes of multi-spectral images is in short supply. For example, imagery sources are increasing in number without a corresponding increase in the number of human image interpreters. In fact, there is real concern regarding the decrease in both the number and experience level of military imagery analysts. For example, multi-spectral images are increasingly available, but no standard for human viewing of multi-spectral images has yet been developed. Both the military and the commercial sectors have made large investments in algorithms for the automated exploitation of multi-spectral imagery. Many of these algorithms employ non-intuitive computations, such as the ratio between pixel intensities in specific wavelength bands. The human interpreter is provided with no capability to verify the results of the automation. Such difficulties are expected to worsen as hyper- and ultra-spectral imaging systems continue to mature. This topic seeks proposals to discover new image processing technologies based on human and biological image processing. Human and other biological systems are known to process images in multiple spectral bands that are held in registration during target recognition and navigation. Further, many of the processing steps of human vision are known and have been formally described, often in terms of algorithms for image processing. This topic encourages the extension of algorithmic descriptions of human multi-spectral image processing to the domain of image display processing.

However, many current approaches for thermal management rely on metallic heatsinks whose excess weight decreases operational payload. Likewise, existing approaches for electrical signal distribution rely on wires consisting of highly conductive metals such as copper, silver or metallic alloys whose high density, e.g. 10.5 g cm-3 for silver and 8.96 g cm-3 for copper, is undesirable for applications in space and aerospace vehicles where weight savings are important. It has been attempted to replace the 22 gauge copper wire currently used in aerospace vehicles with a smaller 26 gauge or 30 gauge wire, but the thinner wires do not have the necessary mechanical strength and durability and therefore cannot be used. Nevertheless, these metals afford the highest conductivity (approximately 6x105 S cm-1 at room temperature) for power, signal and EMI shielding applications In an attempt to address these limitations, considerable research effort during the past twenty years has been spent on conducting polymers. Conjugated polymers such as polyacetylene, polythiophene and polypyrrole have been introduced with electrical conductivity up to 105 S cm-1 by chemical and electrochemical doping. However, these highly conductive doped conjugated polymers are environmentally unstable, exhibit poor mechanical properties and, therefore, have found limited applications, or none where high conductivity is required. New materials technologies are sought which can give thin, highly conductive, low density wires compared with conventional coating and plating technologies or materials incorporating micron-sized metallic fillers. The main advantage to systems is the replacement of metal signal wires in existing aircraft and satellites resulting in a substantial weight savings, improved reliability and enhanced system performance.

The proposed technology will facilitate the development of next generation super-maneuverable air vehicles. A hypersonic weapon system will require the generation of extensive aerodynamic data through a combination of wind tunnel testing, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and flight testing. However, flight testing of hypersonic vehicles at hypersonic velocities is extremely expensive, in some cases exceeding ten million dollars per flight. Researchers must depend on engineering analysis tools for preliminary design and CFD for advanced analysis. These techniques have limitations of their own. A thorough aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic analysis of hypersonic weapons will require a suite of data collection/ generation methods to provide a complete database. Development of a neural network based hypersonic prediction method will allow an efficient method to provide accurate aerodynamic prediction.",238,1701,1,No,No,No,,Provide fundamental understanding of the MEMS based aerodynamic measurement and control approach.

Phase II for the neural network research is to conduct predictor training and validation using existing database on complex geometries.,"The technology developed in this program has many commercial and military applications. MEMS technology could be used to develop weapon systems that do not need traditional aerodynamic control surfaces. This could lead to increased speed, range, and survivability of these systems. In the area of commercial aircraft safety, MEMS devices could be used to sense the onset of stall and prevent flow separation from wings and tail surfaces. This could aid in the prevention of airplane crashes. Neural network research could also aid the commercial aircraft arena, through improved simulation capability of flight performance.",1,"W.

This dependence on digital electronics combined with higher clock rates, power conserving signal levels, increased use of composite materials, onboard radar, communications transmitters, and lasers, increases the chances of Electromagnetic Interference (EMI).

Successful approaches must demonstrate improved performance characteristics over traditional COIL mixing nozzle concepts in one or all of the following aspects of COIL operation: mirror power lading, gain magnitude and distribution, chemical efficiency, and pressure recovery. Traditional COIL mixing nozzles inject molecular iodine/diluent mixtures into the subsonic region of the singlet delta oxygen flow upstream of the nozzle throat, often leading to gain distributions that heavily load the leading edge of the mirrors (seeREFERENCE 1). Studies (seeREFERENCE 2) suggest that one mechanism for alleviating this problem is to inject the molecular iodine/diluent mixture into the supersonic region of the singlet delta oxygen flow, thereby producing a slower gain increase that reduces the power loading on the mirrors. Variations on the supersonic mixing concept offer the possibility of improving the chemical efficiency and pressure recovery of COIL's. One such concept uses parallel mixing of supersonic molecular iodine/diluent and singlet delta oxygen/diluent flows, reducing total pressure loss over traditional transverse molecular iodine/diluent injection mechanisms and improving pressure recovery. Another concept mixes parallel supersonic singlet delta oxygen /diluent and F,HI(DI)/diluent flows. This concept offers the possibility of significantly improved chemical efficiency over traditional COIL devices by using F to produce I in the reaction F + HI (DI) results in HF (DF) + I, thereby eliminating the need to dissociate molecular iodine using singlet delta oxygen. Approaches incorporating some or all aspects of these various concepts are of strong interest to the Air Force in that lighter, more efficient COIL devices may result.",272,1915,1,No,No,No,,"Analyze and develop various COIL mixing nozzle concepts.

Currently, there are several optical techniques for measuring vertical profiles of the refractive index structure parameter (Eaton et al., 1988). There are also in situ techniques for obtaining refractive index structure parameter point measurements from probes mounted on aircraft, providing horizontal and slant path information. What is needed is a technique that can remotely obtain point measurements along a propagation path, such as what could be obtained with a lidar (see for example Chan and Killinger, 1992). A lidar operating from the aircraft platform could potentially obtain a three-dimensional map of refractive index structure parameter in the area of interest where the system must operate. Another advantage of a lidar technique is that it could also sense other parameters of interest including cirrus clouds. Innovative approaches to lidar for measuring refractive index structure parameter will be entertained that show promise for both surface and aircraft operation. The approach must exhibit the potential to operate in a ""vibration"" environment such as with an aircraft platform. Since many of the adaptive optics techniques that were developed by DoD have recently been declassified, many large astronomical observatories are actively pursuing the implementation of adaptive optics for mitigating turbulent effects of long exposure imagery obtained with the large astronomical telescopes.

Since the 1970's, the consensus has been that chemical lasers were the only practical method to acquire high powers at reasonable weights and volumes. On the other hand, electric lasers required large APU's (Auxiliary Power Units) powered by chemicals stored on the aircraft. This requirement produced larger weights for the laser systems, with the APU sometimes making up to 40% of the total weight of the high power laser system. Consequently, until this time, most of the emphasis for high power lasers suitable for military aircraft has been on chemical lasers. With the demonstration of the MEA, this weight issue for electrical lasers is greatly reduced. Concepts using plasmas to sustain lasing may now become much more practical for their use as high power lasers on fighter aircraft. In addition, the use of such plasmas to promote chemical reactions is also important. Previous electrical discharge techniques employing high energy electron beams are not suitable due to the large weights. Possible use of aircraft jet engines to provide the flowing active gaseous laser mediums should be given special attention in order to minimize weights and volumes. Besides gas phase electric lasers, intermediate and lower power approaches involving solid state lasers, fibers, and semiconductors (PILOT) are also important. High peak powers with variable pulsewidths and PRF are attractive for these lower power systems. Efficiency is most important and integration / compatibility with the aircraft is critical. Laser system approaches accounting for possible high g-forces (maybe up to 9) should be followed. Although high powers normally involving gaseous mediums are desired, intermediate levels using solid state lasers, fibers, and semiconductors are also important. PHASE I:Demonstrate, by analysis and possibly through supporting test data, approaches to produce high, intermediate, and low power electrical lasers (and hybrid electro-chemical) having small volumes/weights compatible with F-16 aircraft and other air platforms.

This is particularly true if one end of the communications link is significantly constrained in weight, power consumption, reliability, or cost. However, if an application with these constraints also has low to moderate modulation requirements, an alternate laser communications concept becomes attractive. One example, cited in the following description, is laser communications to and from a very small satellite and the ground; other applications can also be envisioned. The alternate concept for the small satellite laser communications application is as follows: First, a laser site on the ground illuminates the satellite with a laser having a CW beam. Onboard the satellite is a corner cube, which reflects the incident laser light back to the transmitter on the ground. Associated with the corner cube is a modulation mechanism that reacts rapidly to change the intensity or the polarization of the reflected light (for example, this might be liquid crystal light modulator). By appropriately controlling the modulator, the laser light reflected back to the ground station from the corner cube is modulated with the comm. signal. This approach offers the potential advantage of significantly reducing the size and complexity of hardware required onboard the satellite for laser communications while maintaining the secure communications advantages of laser communications in general. The feasibility of the modulated corner cube concept for laser communications has been investigated theoretically, and ground- and balloon-based field experiments have been conducted. Ground field experiments were conducted in December 1994, and a high-altitude balloon experiment was conducted in September 1996, using off-the-shelf hardware for a proof-of-principle demonstration. The experiments used 1"" corner cubes coupled with a liquid-crystal screen as the modulating element. The tests were 100% successful, with the received signal strength exceeding that predicted before the tests. However, because of the limitations of the liquid crystal screen, the modulation rate was limited to 50 kbps. The major technology issue in establishing the modulated corner cube concept for many military laser communication applications is the development of the modulation approach to meet the operational requirements for higher modulation rates. To substantially increase the modulation rate beyond that possible with off-the-shelf liquid crystal screens, alternate means of modulation must be investigated and developed.",401,2837,1,No,No,No,,"Conceive and evaluate a range of alternate concepts based on the potential ability to meet operational modulation requirements, technical feasibility, and expected impact on the platform in an operational implementation.","After the Phase I concept evaluation, further develop the most promising concepts (one or two), with the goal of producing proof-of-principle hardware for experimental evaluation and demonstration of performance in the laboratory.","The modulated corner cube concept for laser communications is particularly attractive in applications where one end of the communications link is significantly constrained in weight, power consumption, reliability, or cost. By using this concept, low-impact, secure communications links could be established between: 1) ground and very small satellites, 2) manned aircraft and UAVs, 3) satellites and UAVs, 4) satellites or aircraft and unattended ground sensors, and 5) aircraft and ground personnel (special ops, search and rescue operations). Commercial analogs of these military missions can also be considered. For example, several commercial communication satellite constellations are being launched or are planned for future launches (Iridium, Teledesic, Celestri, etc.). Satellite-to-satellite communication links for these constellations typically use laser communications, but the satellite-to-ground links are always based on RF communication. If high modulation rates can be demonstrated with the modulated corner cube concept, then the larger RF communications package on the satellite could be replaced with a modulated corner cube system, with substantially less impact on the satellite platform.",1,"C.

Pressure is used to create the doubly curved mirror. The membranes on these large apertures will range in thickness from 10 micrometers to 150 micrometers. This technology is very well suited for deploying an optical system to space, since the membranes can be packaged on the ground and erected after deployment. An optically transparent canopy matched with a reflective film will comprise the pressure vessel. This SBIR is focused on the development of an optically transparent canopy. The science and engineering community has done a lot of quality work in the development of optically transparent thin films. The optical performance of these films was primarily judged on its transmissive power characteristics. Since this canopy will be used in an imaging system, both amplitude and phase of the incoming light must be considered in the design space with phase maintenance being clearly the most important aspect. This typically implies that the thickness and the homogeneity of the membrane be held to a very tight tolerance. Specifically, the transmission losses during a single pass should be limited to 5% of the total input power; this total includes both Fresnel losses and absorption. Maximum absorption should be limited to 2% of the total input power. In addition, the wavefront phase error introduced over an aperture of 30 cm during a single pass should be limited to less than 25 nanometers rms. Optical phase testing of these membranes will be completed at the Phillips Site as long as the sample sheets are at least 1 meter in diameter with the area under test being the central 30 centimeters. Phillips will mount the film in a proven test fixture. Test data in the form of interference fringe patterns will be returned to the contractor for evaluation. Two double pass tests will be performed: One will be taken when th thin film is mounted flat, and the other will be pressurized to a curvature with a central deflection to diameter aspect ration of 1:50. Optical losses due to transmission effects shall be accomplished by the contractor. Note that the thickness of the membrane intentionally is not specified and is not considered a crucial design point. This canopy must maintain its optical properties for five years when placed in an environment similar to a geosynchronous orbit around the earth. After five years, transmission losses should still be less than 10% of total input power, and phase error as described above should be maintained below 100 nanometers rms.",437,2673,1,No,No,No,,"Fabricate an optical quality thin film with the goal of achieving the requirements described above.

Combining microlithography with ferroelectric domain reversal has led to engineerable nonlinear optical materials. Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is available in sufficient lengths and has enough nonlinearity to produce a singly resonant, continuous-wave, optical parametric oscillator with a threshold of less than 5Watts. However, lithium niobate is also photorefractive. The optical fields in the material liberate free carriers. These free carriers eventually migrate out of the optical fields. The displaced carriers create static electric fields which, through the electro-optic effect, generate index changes. These index changes lead to scattering, losses, and phase mismatch of the nonlinear optical process. The index changes can be removed by heating the crystal, which redistributes the displaced carriers and eliminates the static electric fields. Investigators have found the index variations can be reduced significantly by operating the devices at elevated temperatures.

A typical process in the development of a commercial microwave tube by the conventional microwave tube industry is to repetitively pulse the tube, and over several thousand pulses progressively turn up the Rf power and slowly condition the tube. Conventional modulators are incapable of powering any multigigawatt HPM tubes to enable investigating this conditioning process. Hence, an innovative pulsed-power R&D effort is required. The primary emphasis is to use innovative design concepts to minimize the cost and packaging while maintaining the reliability and reproducibility of the output electrical pulse. The electrical considerations must include the ability to apply a maximum 600 kV pulse to a vacuum diode with an arbitrary, but fixed impedance between 10 and 50 Ohms with no more than 5% reflection from the load back to the modulator. The pulse shape must satisfy a 1 microsecond flattop (+/- 5 %) with a 50 nanosecond rise and fall time. Given that this modulator will be used in a repetitive fashion (at up to 100 pulses per second during a 10-second period), cooling issues for the pulse power components and the technique for charging the modulator will be important. Since some experiments using this modulator may not require the full duty cycle, and perhaps only a few pulses, a control system must allow selecting the number of pulses per burst and the pulse repetition rate. The physical size of the modulator should be minimized, and at a maximum should not exceed 25 ft (length) by 10 ft (width) and 10 ft (height), and the weight should be less than 6,000 lbs not counting weight of the insulating medium (such as transformer oil). The interface between the modulator and any HPM tube must be compatible with obtaining a base vacuum of order 2.0E-9 Torr. Given that laboratories exist in various locations (e.g., Albuquerque is at an altitude of 5,300 feet), means that consideration must be given to the possibility that the ambient air pressure is reduced if air insulation of high voltage components is planned. The power supply to energize the modulator is not a deliverable for this project. If transformer oil is chosen as the insulating medium, the oil is not to be delivered with the modulator. The control console for the modulator must be able to be located at least 150 feet from the modulator and provide for interfaces to any high voltage power supply and any laboratory safety interlock systems.",442,2667,1,No,No,No,,"During Phase I of this project the modulator should be designed electrically and mechanically. Consideration will also be given to the source of the prime power, specifically are the power supply requirements consistent with typical laboratory electrical power grids. The mechanical layout must allow for attaching a vacuum system typically used in laboratories for HPM sources, and be consistent with any electrical cross-talk between components and high voltage isolation requirements. PHASE II:During Phase II a prototype modulator will be built and tested for single shot reproducibility and modest repetitive operation ( ~ 1 pulse per second for 10 pulses) with tracability to the full burst mode requirement. The main demonstration will be to drive a 10 Ohm, 20 Ohm, and 50 Ohm resistive load and show that the output current pulse tracks the input voltage pulse with minimal inductive loss. The modulator and all documentation will then be delivered to AFRL for installation and final acceptance testing with our HPM sources.",,"Economical, high average power modulators have an amazing potential market for Air Force missions of ACC and AFSOC and civilian markets. Companies and markets already exist for treatment of food and hazardous waste. The major limit for them is the maximum average power available which limits the amount of material that may be processed.

Examples employing a YAG host yield 91% quantum efficiency using a 940-nm pump wavelength with a laser wavelength of 1030 nm. Using a uniaxial host crystal of (YLF), 94.3% quantum efficiency results from using a pi-polarized pump wavelength at 960 nm with an s-polarized lasing wavelength at 1018 nm. Though both hosts are ideally suited for scalable high-power operation, the YLF crystal adds the benefit of low-thermal lensing and negligible birefringence when diffraction-limited operation is desired. There are many applications that require or could benefit from the use of a scaleable, frequency stable, tunable laser source. A few examples include pump sources for single-frequency optical parametric oscillators (OPO), resonant non-linear frequency conversion, spectroscopy, laser clocks, and remote sensing. Unfortunately, commercially available robust, low-power, single-frequency master oscillator lasers do not exist at the Yb laser emission wavelengths. If available, injection-locking techniques or regenerative amplifiers could be used to scale these low-power sources into high-power, single-frequency, cw laser devices thus increasing the number of possible applications. The YLF host laser wavelength is particularly suited to pumping praseodymium ion in fiber amplifiers for 1.3-um communication systems and to pumping an OPO with intracavity sum-frequency generation (SFG) producing a 589 nm laser for use as a sodium beacon guide star in telescope adaptive-optics systems. A number of approaches have been used to obtain single-frequency operation in diode-pumped lasers including monolithic non-planar ring oscillators (NPRO), birefringent tuning filters, twisted-mode resonators, and microchip laser designs. In particular, the robustness and frequency stability obtained with the NPRO design for Neodymium:YAG lasers sets a user-friendly standard to strive toward. New, diffusion-bonding processes may make monolithic designs utilizing the Yb ion possible. In addition, though broad-frequency tuning may be achievable, emphasis must first be placed on the laser's free-running frequency stability (better than a few tens of kHz/s for both jitter and thermal drift) for ease of injection locking. Because of the number of applications requiring an ultra-narrow linewidth, it is expected that fast frequency tuning (at least several tens of kHz bandwidth) of the laser device be incorporated for locking to externalREFERENCEs. Examples of externalREFERENCEs might be a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity, using the second harmonic tuned to an iodine spectral line, or possibly, if a wide-tunability (up to 1064 nm) is achieved tuning to molecular overtone resonance lines in C2HD, C2H2, or CO2.",404,2862,1,No,No,No,,"Resonator design trade-off analyses are to be conducted, including modeling, to determine the best configuration for ultra-narrow linewidth, tunable single-frequency low-power laser oscillators.

The preliminary designs should include both YAG and YLF hosts to determine if similar technology could be used for separate laser systems. Experimental investigations should be conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the resonator designs at the lasing wavelengths of 1030 nm and 1018 nm. PHASE II:The proven resonator designs for both YAG and YLF hosts are to progress into more compact, robust packages thus demonstrating their commercial feasibility.

In the micro-latchup case, some small area of the chip enters latchup, which is a condition that prevents its proper operation and can also damage the device. A symptom of this condition is a very slight increase of the supply current into the IC (integrated circuit) device.

One result of OPC is a Phase Conjugate Mirror (PCM) which reflects diverging light so that it converges back to its source point. The PCM is a 3-D mirror which can be created from a solid, liquid, or gas by applying the process of ""4 Wave Mixing"" to the substance. A satellite vehicle equipped with a PCM could be illuminated by a laser and reflect the laser back with very little amplitude or phase degradation, because the OPC process reverses the effect of atmospheric turbulence. Another OPC-derived capability is an ""induced laser,"" in which a PCM acts as a lasing medium in conjunction with a reflective surface. When the PCM starts lasing, some scattered light reflects off of the reflective surface, creating a self-sustaining laser beam between the PCM and the reflective surface. When the reflective surface is moved, the laser beam moves with the reflector because the beam is optically locked with the reflector. The advantage of a self-locking laser beam to the problem of satellite vehicle tracking is clear--the accuracy and simplicity of satellite vehicle tracking could be enhanced greatly. Since the ""induced laser"" effect uses an reflective surface, the range of the self-locking effect may be limited due to atmospheric turbulence as well as beam divergence from the reflective surface, and therefore may be suitable only for space-based tracking.",240,1486,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I includes the setup and testing of ""4 Wave Mixing"" phase conjugate mirrors in the laboratory, with the objective of finding space-qualified mirror material.

This is an attempt to develop a global, assimilative ionospheric model which currently does not exist. If successful, such a model would significantly broaden the applicability and usefulness of ionospheric observations, in general, and would improve the ability to specify and forecast ionospheric parameters globally. The maturity of the global, physically-based, theoretical models to realistically reproduce, in a climotological sense, large-scale ionospheric plasma distributions and features has been well-established by a number of scientists (Preble et al., 1994; Schunk, 1996; Anderson et al., 1997). While the validation and verification of these models has historically been carried out using a limited set of observations over limited geographical regions (low, mid or high latitudes), to date there has been no concerted effort to develop a global, assimilative ionospheric model. The proposed model should incorporate a wide variety of ionospheric observations, meld these appropriately into the model, and produce global distributions of ion and electron density profiles. There is an ever-growing database of ionospheric observations being obtained from both ground-based and satellite sensors. These sensors include 1) ground-based digital HF ionospheric sounders measuring bottomside electron density profiles, 2) ground-based dual frequency GPS receivers obtaining slant TEC values, 3) ground-based HF radars such as the SuperDarn network in the northern and southern hemispheres measuring ionospheric ExB horizontal drift velocities, 4) two DMSP satellites obtaining in situ electron and ion densities and temperatures at 840 km as well as energetic particle precipitation fluxes and high latitude ExB drift velocities, 5) a GPS/MET low earth orbit (LEO) satellite measuring TEC profiles up to 740 km, 6) a TOPEX dual frequency altimeter on the Poseidon satellite measuring vertical TEC values over the ocean areas, and 7) several EUV satellite sensors (Polar Bear, POLAR, ARGOS) measuring UV radiances from the daytime, nighttime and auroral regions. This work will lay the foundation of how to incorporate the SSUSI and SSULI UV sensor data into ionospheric models. The availability of this model would immediately serve numerous customers by providing the best ionosphere as a basis to generate tailored products that mitigate impacts on both DoD and civilian operational systems. This is exactly the type of model which is required to move from global ionospheric climotology to global ionospheric ""weather"". It is appropriate, now, to generate an ionospheric assimilation model because there is an ever-growing database of ionospheric observations from both ground-based and satellite-borne sensors. Additionally, there exists the potential for even greater data sources from the proposed suite of GPS/MET-like satellite sensors, an expanded network of ground-based dual frequency GPS receivers in the International GPS Service for Geodynamics (IGS) network, and the two UV imagers, SSUSI and SSULI, due to fly on DMSP F16 and above.",477,3284,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the preliminary design and concept which describes 1) how the global ionospheric assimilation model will be constructed and how it incorporates a wide variety of observations, 2) what the observations are and what sensors are required, and 3) how the model will be validated once it has been constructed.

All civilian users (a million plus) of single frequency GPS receivers require realistic ionospheric corrections to achieve accurate navigation position information. This includes all private and commercial aircraft utilizing the future FAA Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). The outputs of the assimilation model would provide these corrections. The model also has application as a near real-time, global ionospheric forecast model that could be run at AFSPC's 55 SWXS, who supplies DoD space environmental support, and at the civilian counterpart at NOAA's Space Environment Center. Additionally, the flexibility and computational speed of the model would allow a large number of users the ability to develop ionospheric tailored products for specific navigation and communication customers. It is envisioned that such an ionospheric assimilation model would be the Space Weather equivalent of the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Numerical Weather Model which has hundreds of users and applications.",1,"Anderson, D.

Contact windows between a satellite and a ground station/satellite are temporal and location dependent. Scheduling of an optimal task sequence for assignment of network resources to meet concurrent contacts (via single beam and/or multiple beam antenna) and other operational requirements without violating temporal, compatibility and capacity constraints, is a complex problem. In addition, constraints, priority, mission requirements, resource availability and emergency requests are dynamic and vary between satellites. Current automated scheduling schemes are incapable of producing near optimal results in real-time for maximum network performance and resource utilization, resulting in costly and inefficient satellite operations. A solution for eliminating this deficiency is to develop adaptive scheduling algorithms capable of achieving optimal tasking order and resource assignment. Cost is then reduced through automation and efficient operations. The purpose of this research is to develop automated task scheduling algorithms that can adapt to changing rules, constraints and scenarios, and which react to provide dynamically updated schedules for satellite network operations. The algorithms would allow for human intervention for approval or override of the schedules generated. At least three algorithms that are intrinsically different in their technical approach should be developed and demonstrated. New and innovative or hybrid techniques with adaptive and learning capabilities should be considered. Potential new resource capabilities and operational concepts such as simultaneous multiple satellite links and distributed scheduling will be factored into algorithm design.

False bit detection, induced by ionizing radiation or the complete failure of receivers, will prevent optical processors or interconnects to be used reliably in space. Current research indicates that 10 GHz receivers are realizable. However, further developments in the design of radiation-tolerant receivers and so-called ""Smart Pixels"" that can operate as emitter, modulator and detector is required. An example of a promising technology that has an inherently high radiation tolerance through its design, is Fabry-Perot cavity-enhanced Multiple Quantum Well (MQW) structures that also meet anticipated low power requirements. The photoreceivers should be capable of a bandwidth of 10 GHz or above, and should have a peak detection efficiency at 850 nm for optical processors or the onboard satellite data link, and 1550 nm for inter-satellite communication applications. Potentially suitable, monolithic photodetectors and smart pixels are already under development and may be readily adapted for this application. The final detector design, preferably a III-V detector material monolithically integrated with CMOS, should be capable of operating for a minimum of 10 years in low earth orbit at an inclination of 30 to 60 degrees with a bit error rate of 10(-10). Within this time frame, the detection efficiency should not drop below 50% of the pre-flight performance. If a monolithic design (detector plus driving circuitry) is chosen, both the detector and the driving circuitry is to be radiation tolerant at the above specifications. PHASE I:Identify a suitable high bandwidth (|10 GHz) photoreceiver or smart pixel design concept. A suitable design has to be advanced to entail the complete growth sheet.

PEMs are used in packaging over 85% of commercial integrated circuits. Among the possible benefits in using the commercial off the shelf PEM components are: reduced costs/weight, greater availability, decreased size, and access to a commercially developed, enhanced, and on-going improvement process for packaging. On the other hand, while PEMs have been considered for use in space for over a decade, there are some possible obstacles that must be addressed. These include: a) non-hermetic seals, b) outgassing, c) possible degradation due to long-term storage and ""non-operating"" conditions, d) narrow temperature range, e) package cracking ""popcorn effect"") during board assembly, and f) not fully characterized radiation hardness. The goal of this project is to develop a test methodology which will qualify PEMs for use in space. PEM parts selected as candidates for space qualification, must conform to existing functional requirements/standards. The project should address various configurations of commercially available PEMs (quad flat packs, ball grid arrays, and other relevant styles). An outcome of this activity (based on actual testing of commercial microelectronic components) would be to build a database from which a set of guidelines may be developed for the use of PEMs in space applications. Test methodology would include statistical quality control methods as well as 100% screen tests and lot conformance tests. The tests must cover a temperature cycling range from -55 degrees C to +125 degrees C, radiation hardness tests covering the range from 100 krad to 1 Mrad, and HAST at 131degrees C for 100 hours. Consultation with existing laboratories which have already begun work in this arena (the PEM community, ""PEMC"", such as NASA, Rome Lab., commercial companies, the University of Maryland, etc.) as to test procedures and test results required to build consensus and credibility, is strongly advised.

However, laser-based testing to date has been confined to utilization of expensive optical table-top systems and has been primarily employed for research. This proposal envisions the development of a diode laser-based SEE probe station which could be used by the microelectronic designer and test engineer. The probe station would be compact and would ideally be designed to facilitate wafer-probe evaluation of parts, a task which is impractical with current systems. The probe station shall be constructed to hold a solid state laser or other compact and vibration insensitive lasers and shall focus the laser beam onto the device under test (DUT). The microscope setup would be mounted on a two-dimensional translation stage with sub-micron spatial resolution that would move the diode laser, focusing optics, and associated apparatus through at least one inch of travel in orthogonal directions in the plane of the DUT. Ideally, the probe station would be modular so that various lasers could be used as needed to take advantage of different laser wavelengths. Simulation of single event phenomena will require laser pulses shorter than 50 psec in duration. The exact pulsewidth required is unknown; however, typical research facilities use pulses of 20 psec or less. Lasers with wavelengths in both the 600-650 nm and 800-900 nm ranges are desirable. Pulse energies should exceed 0.1 nJ. Pulse repetition rates should range from single shot to a few hundred hertz. The microscope would contain a zoom lens device in order to focus and control the laser spot size in the plane of the DUT. Spot sizes from 200 microns down to 1-2 microns would be desirable. This spot size requirement assumes a Gaussian shaped pulse with the designated spot sizes at the 1/e diameter of the intensity. The microscope system would also contain two additional ports: one to allow injection of white light to illuminate the region under test, and the other to allow imaging of the device under test using a CCD (charge coupled diode) camera system. The microscope-laser assembly should be compact and designed to be integrated with a standard microelectronics wafer probe station.",378,2384,1,No,No,No,,"Perform the layout and design of the SEE test module.

SEE affects microelectronics for avionics as well as spacecraft. SEE are also of concern to designers of memory devices such as SRAMs (static random access memory) and DRAMs (dynamic random access memory), which may be susceptible to soft errors induced by radioactive decay in the natural terrestrial environment or by cosmic rays. The SEE test system would also have potential applications for testing charge-coupled device imaging sensors, as well as other imaging sensors, by allowing charge to be generated within a single pixel or within multiple pixels. This would be of use for evaluating fill factor or charge transfer efficiency in devices used as star trackers, or in medical, dental, and other imaging applications.

One of the problems encountered in manufacturing these SOI products, however, is that many of the metrology techniques and instruments needed to characterize and qualify the SOI starting wafers are lacking. Technology/processes/equipment are urgently needed to verify/characterize such basic properties as: 1) the thickness of the silicon film and the buried insulating layer (these values cannot generally be measured quickly and accurately, especially for silicon films thicker than about 10 micrometers); 2) the integrity of the silicon film to insulating layer bond interface (at which microvoids and contamination are both important and difficult to measure); 3) the resistivity and defect density of the silicon film; 4) the density and charge trapping properties of the buried oxide; and 5) the presence and concentration of contaminants, such as oxygen, carbon, and heavy metals. Because of the way bonded wafers are now manufactured, a cassette of finished wafers may contain material from different silicon crystals, and these wafers may have been oxidized, bonded, ground, and polished at different times, or even using different pieces of equipment. This precludes the use of lot sampling methods to qualify the material, making it imperative that the characterization tests that are proposed be cost effective, possess timely on-line capability, and be non-destructive.

Initially, microwave integrated circuit (MIC) structured discrete devices will be used to demonstrate how to achieve the required performance; the design will then be transitioned to microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) technology to show compatibility with the current modules being considered for phased arrays. The power output of the test modules should be between two and three watts with a quiescent power of approximately ten milliwatts.

Significant success has been achieved in massive integration of active components (e.g., transistors, diodes) into integrated circuits. Passive components, however, are more than often attached discretely to the next level of assembly, whether a hybrid, multi-chip module (MCM) or printed wiring board. Specialized, low-profile resistor and capacitor components have been traditionally employed in hybrids and MCMs. However, these components and the labor associated with inserting them into an MCM is significant. Even in highly automated assembly operations, the expense of inserting passive components is greater than that of the components themselves. This problem will be exacerbated as more designs migrate from discrete analog and mixed signal assemblies to MCM form. By incorporating the components into the MCM fabrication process directly, the expense of procuring, screening, and assembling dozens of components is practically eliminated. Furthermore, integral components will provide for a greater overall substrate efficiency, resulting in smaller, more efficient, and more reliable MCMs. The net benefit to military/commercial space systems is a reduction in size, weight, power, and cost, with a collateral benefit in improved performance, particularly in mixed signal systems which often require complex networks of these components. The objective of this project is to develop innovative technologies to allow integration of bilateral, passive components in the MCM fabrication process. The preferred technique is one which will allow formation/integration of these components within the interconnection system itself and will be applicable and transferable to high performance polymeric-based MCM technologies. Alternately, but less desirable, are approaches that depend on a particular type of substrate. Of least interest (but an acceptable approach) is the development of a new, unique MCM technology.

Two inherent weaknesses of the parabolic antennas with respect to satellite vehicle tracking are 1) the relatively large angular spread of the main beam lobe at S-Band frequency, and 2) the existence of significant side lobes at S-Band frequency. Both of these weaknesses can, and sometimes do, negatively impact satellite vehicle tracking accuracy, especially if the satellite vehicle's transponder is down. Both of these weaknesses are caused by the physics of electromagnetic waves and parabolic antennas. A tunable S-Band maser beam addresses both of the weaknesses of parabolic antennas, because the maser's main beam width depends on the size and shape of the resonant cavity, and no side bands of any consequence exist. Laser technology has matured to the point where some manufacturing techniques and control systems could possibly be migrated to maser systems (e.g., tunable lasing systems, low flutter, low drift, low power, high temporal and spatial coherence). By supplementing a parabolic antenna with an S-Band maser, a ground antenna site would be able to accurately track anomalous or ""silent"" satellite vehicles. Also, an S-Band maser would be able to deliver a signal with high EIRP to a satellite vehicle without blanketing the surrounding area with side lobe radiation, as a parabolic antenna does.",229,1512,1,No,No,No,,"Setup and test an S-Band maser prototype using COTS equipment.

Phase I also includes experimentation of adaptive optics concepts into the S-Band region. Optical phase conjugation, phase conjugation mirrors, and atmospheric distortion compensation should attempt to be migrated from current laser technology to maser technology. PHASE II:Create a powerful (> 0.5 kilowatt) proof-of-concept S-Band maser equipped with at least one adaptive optics capability (migrated from laser adaptive optics in Phase I). The Phase II maser would be tested by being slaved to an existing tracking antenna and illuminating an existing satellite vehicle to determine if a significant increase in range/range rate accuracy can be demonstrated.

These ground stations are major contributors to the overall cost of satellite control networks. Part of the solution to reduce the high cost of satellite network operations is to optimally place ground antennas for minimal number of antennas and ground stations while still meeting the required level of satellite support. However, there has been very little open research in determining an optimal placement of antennas/ground stations for concurrent multiple satellite operations while satisfying many constraints in temporal and location dependency, priority, criticality and other resource scheduling factors. It is a very complex nonlinear global minimization problem with many operating constraints and there is no known analytical method to provide an exact optimal solution to this problem. The purpose of this research is to develop methods, algorithms and analytical solutions that can determine optimal placement of ground antennas to concurrently support many satellites.

The basic requirement is for a three frequency radiometer with appropriate data acquisition and recording capability, all suitable for field use. The instrumentation developed will be used to perform measurements at sites of interest for military and commercial users. The principal frequencies of interest are 20, 30, and 44 GHz. In recent years there has been a large effort in measuring and modeling rain attenuation and this effort is still continuing; however, some current systems operating at EHF (extremely high frequency) utilize field terminals with small apertures which consequently have small link margins. For these terminals, particularly at low elevation angles, clouds and gaseous absorption can cause a link outage. Unfortunately, cloud attenuation statistics data are not available to develop a viable global cloud model. This proposal is a step to provide the basis for characterizing attenuation in non-raining, cloudy conditions. The system is also required to be capable of measuring attenuation when it is raining. Contact with existing programs that use radiometers for measurements (such as the advanced communications technology satellite [ACTS], and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] programs) is strongly suggested prior to design/development of the instrument required for this project. It may also be advantageous to consider some coordination or collaboration with these programs. It is desirable to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware wherever possible to minimize cost and enhance subsequent manufacture. It is also desirable to have a single antenna to cover the frequency ranges indicated. Prior to instrument design, the approach to several key issues (among others) must be determined: 1) how the measurements should be made, 2) how data acquisition should be implemented to avoid data-taking when no attenuating medium is present, 3) how to calibrate and validate measurements, 4) what the need for ancillary data such as temperature, humidity, rain gauges, etc. is, and 5) other issues, including the requirements of dynamic range, fade dynamics, and statistics of outage.",343,2333,1,No,No,No,,"1) Develop preliminary design of radiometric instrument system, 2) with Air Force assistance, check adequacy of design parameters with other existing programs that utilize radiometric instruments to ensure compatibility of usage, and 3) develop prototype design/test plan and demonstrate mutually agreed-to key elements of the design.

Also a chief issue is the efficient packaging of MEMS devices and co-integration with electronics. More than enabling size, weight, and power reduction, MEMS can also promote the significant issues of ease of integration through novel concepts that allow rapid and standard access and interchange of spacecraft panels, intra-panel components, and internal spacecraft bus systems.",238,1858,1,No,No,No,,"Design and develop novel micro- and meso-scale electromechanical concepts.

Large amounts of data are collected from each satellite and downlinked to the ground where a variety of independent techniques are used to assess whether there exists any information of value. In addition, there is virtually no collaboration between satellites with respect to each others' position or knowledge about detected objects of interest. The amount of data collected and downlinked could be significantly reduced if more intelligence is placed onboard, providing the ability to process, detect, and interpret information onboard the satellite and adjust and/or configure sensors accordingly based on sensor data. A large number of past and current research efforts have focused on target recognition under a variety of different environments and scenarios. The focus of this research topic is to leverage off of that research and to develop a top-level onboard executive controller which would monitor and control the processing of satellite data and sensors. Each satellite's onboard controller would operate autonomously in cooperation with executive controllers onboard other satellites as well as ground-based controllers. Each of these controllers would act as top-level intelligent agents. The basic concept behind an intelligent agent is the notion of an independent software entity that operates within some environment (e.g., satellite sensing environment) while always attempting to achieve some goal (e.g., detecting entities, controlling sensor pointing, etc). Agents can have a simple task such as monitoring a battery voltage, or they can have a much more complex function such as detecting specific targets using technologies such as neural networks. The way each agent reacts and attempts to achieve its individual objective is based on stimuli received from other entities within the environment. Each of these top-level agent-based controllers would in turn communicate with lower-level agents which would have more specific tasks. The strength of the agent approach to satellite autonomy is the ability to react to uncertainty and changing mission requirements. A key to this research effort is the ability of the agents to cooperate with one another whether they reside on the same satellite or across different satellites. For example, an agent residing on one satellite may detect some object of interest and react accordingly. To optimize information processing, relevant information can be made available to a second satellite such that when the object comes within its field of view it can already be configured to optimize observation of the object in question. The notion of an intelligent agent-based controller can be extended to include health and status related satellite autonomy.",429,2848,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a detailed design and description for this agent-based architecture for satellite payload autonomy. This will include, but not be limited to, the following: 1) mechanism by which agents communicate, 2) means by which a situational assessment is made based on the status of individual agents, 3) detailed description of the satellite surveillance domain and where and how various agents would be utilized, and 4) specification of the software and hardware platform to be used along with a description of the key software agents to be used. Of the above goals, inter-agent cooperation is considered most important. A prototype demonstration of the proposed architecture is desired. PHASE II:Implement the design generated in Phase I and provide an in-depth demonstration of its capability. The architecture should be designed such that it can be extended easily to incorporate new agents as needs arise. Demonstration of this extensibility/flexibility is desired. Demonstrating this technology in an actual flight experiment is ideal; however, if time and cost prevent this, then the demonstration should be as realistic as possible with an easy migration towards a flight experiment.",,"DUAL USE APPLICATION: Satellite autonomy is a critical concern in both military and commercial space industries to increase reliability while reducing operating costs. The concept of an intelligent agent architecture is not specific to satellite autonomy, but has applicability to any number of different domains. Any process which involves monitoring a number of different entities from different sources and providing a situational assessment based on all of these entities could benefit from such an intelligent agent-based architecture.",1,"Web Site - www.cs.sfu.ca/cs/people/GradStudents/khopkins/personal/papers/agent_readings/index.html.; Ballard, Dan, ""Intelligent Agents and Agent Communication Languages for Mission Operations,"" Phase I SBIR Final Report by Reticular Systems, Contract #NAS5-33264, Jun 1996.; Agent Technologies HomePage, www.agenttech.com; Hopkins, Kory, ""An Examination of Agent Technologies"", Simon Fraser University,; Nwana, Hyacinth, Software Agents: An Overview"", UMBC Agent Web site - www.cs.umbc.edu/agents.; Zetocha, Paul, and Ortiz, James, ""Phillips Executive Agent-Based Controller Helper (PEACH),"" Proceedings of SpaceOps 98 Conference, Tokyo Japan, Jun 1997.","Web Site - www.cs.sfu.ca/cs/people/GradStudents/khopkins/personal/papers/agent_readings/index.html.; Ballard, Dan, ""Intelligent Agents and Agent Communication Languages for Mission Operations,"" Phase I SBIR Final Report by Reticular Systems, Contract #NAS5-33264, Jun 1996.; Agent Technologies HomePage, www.agenttech.com; Hopkins, Kory, ""An Examination of Agent Technologies"", Simon Fraser University,; Nwana, Hyacinth, Software Agents: An Overview"", UMBC Agent Web site - www.cs.umbc.edu/agents.; Zetocha, Paul, and Ortiz, James, ""Phillips Executive Agent-Based Controller Helper (PEACH),"" Proceedings of SpaceOps 98 Conference, Tokyo Japan, Jun 1997.",6,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58207/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58207/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,99.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:41:50,,,,,AF99-066_58207,DOD_SBIR_99_P1_C1_AF99-066,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:26.757468+00

One way of addressing these needs is by examining the feasibility of thin film, flexible, lithium batteries with either solid or gelled electrolytes.

The Air Force problem is to decrease the mass and volume of switches used in space systems, and to make these switches compatible with proposed microsatellite system bus architectures, specifically the Multi-Functional Structure system (MFS) in which interconnect wiring is formed directly in a laminated plastic substrate which also functions as the spacecraft structure. Latching relays fabricated directly in the MFS substrate will increase the flexibility of microsatellite design. Beyond the usual power routing and overload protection tasks, this embedded switching capability will make it possible for the system to reconfigure itself when hardware fails, or to switch in backup systems. Numerous high fidelity DC-capable switches will make the multifunctional substrate more flexible at the design stage by allowing a more generic architecture to be manufactured in volume, then customized for the specific hardware mounted on it by setting the switches properly. This re-routing capability will also enable on-orbit robotic repair of electrical systems, or will add new modules to an existing system. Acceptable approaches would employ some form of actuator change the state of the switch, which does not require power after state change. To meet Air Force needs, each switch should consume no more than 100 mW of power for no more than 500 milliseconds when changing states, and must be completely unpowered when in the final state. Each individual switch should be capable of carrying 1 ampere at 5 volts, and should have a standoff voltage TBD above 3,000V when the contacts are open. Switches should employ industry standard metalization for reliable contacts. Switches should fit within an area of approximately 2 x 0.25 cm. The switch must have at least 2 stable positions, and the design should be flexible enough to allow a single actuator to throw multiple contacts, i.e. a multi-pole, double-throw switch. Switches must be fabricated directly in the MFS material system, the main component of which is the laminated Kapton plastic sheets. Actuators must operate in the natural space environment within a TBD temperature range. Contact resistance for a single closed contact should not exceed 0.1 ohms. The actuation circuitry must be isolated from the signal path being switched. PHASE I:Establish the viability of the actuation mechanism, and develop the fabrication techniques for the actuator(s). Outline the possible latching switch architectures.

Intelligent sensing systems combine the detection processing and control functions of complete optical systems onto a single package such as a focal plane, detector chip or multichip module. One promising application of intelligent optical systems for autonomous satellites is in the detection, processing, and evaluation of polarization imagery. Imagery from the polarization properties of passive radiation emitted and reflected in the short wave, mid-wave and long wave IR has shown potential for improved target discrimination over other IR imaging techniques. (Ref.'s 1-2) The polarization state of an electromagnetic wave is fully described by a set of four parameters known as the Stokes parameters.(Ref.'s 3-5) Collectively, these parameters comprise the Stokes vector and represent the magnitudes of the unpolarized component, two different linear polarized components, and the circularly polarized component of the radiation. It is the relations between these four parameters that can act as tools for the discrimination of military targets in IR imagery. (Ref.'s 6-10) Development of an integrated optical imaging polarimeter requires consideration of optical polarization detection hardware in which the polarization state at each pixel in an image is determined. In combination with the polarization state, processing circuitry must be developed to detect anomalous or prescribed polarization signals. To be useful in space applications, systems developed in this program must detect and process polarization information autonomously. Optical and electronic components should be simple and compact, and processing algorithms should be suitable for implementation in onboard processors.

The Air Force problem is to decrease the mass and volume of connectors used in space systems, and to accommodate more connections with smaller, lighter hardware. A self-aligning system will not only enable more contacts per area than is possible with current manually aligned connectors, but may also enable future systems for on-orbit robotic repair of electrical systems. Acceptable approaches would employ some form of actuator to align the contact pins as well as to grip the two halves of the connector system together. One approach may be to use shape memory alloy which holds one shape when heated electrically, and another when unpowered. A two-stage approach to alignment may also be necessary, with rough alignment via tapered pins, and final alignment with some active pin-positioning system. The contact pins may be aligned as a whole, as long as the pin-to-pin spacing on both halves of the connector are held rigidly. To meet Air Force needs, the connector system can consume up to 4 watts of power for no more than 5 seconds when engaging, but must be completely unpowered when in the connected or disconnected state. The connector halves must be mechanically interlocked when engaged and unpowered, with no further manual tightening needed. The person making the connection should merely have to bring the two halves together with zero insertion force, and the automatic system should take over for contact pin alignment and mechanical joining of the two connector halves. The pin-to-pin spacing should be no more than 10 mils, with smaller spacing desirable. The design should allow for multiple rows of contact pins and should include a method of bringing the wiring from the cable to the contact pins of the connector.",323,1971,1,No,No,No,,"Prove the viability of the actuation mechanism and develop the fabrication techniques for the actuator(s).

Photonics technology has overcome many of the problems associated with wire-based data transfer. Optical information exchange via the use of high speed lasers, modulators, and fiber optics will continue to play a greater role in managing this ever-increasing data congestion. The introduction of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) offers promise in alleviating these problems. The issue to be addressed in this topic is a need for active alignment of multiple optical fibers to VCSEL or detector arrays. With advancements in the produceability of Micro Electro Mechanical systems (MEMs), it is projected that the geometry of VCSELs and MEMs could be integrated to form robust optical interconnects for use with singlemode optical fibers or free space board-to-board communications. Currently, the methods for aligning and fixing optical fibers to small active regions of laser diodes or detectors is economical for cases where only several fibers are being coupled. With an increasing number of active elements to be aligned, the issues become technically challenging and costly. The primary issue is the thermal stability of the alignment structure and how dimensional expansion/contraction affects the ultimate alignment of multiple elements. This dimensional instability problem increases greatly when the fiber being aligned is of the singlemode type. Singlemode fibers typically have core sizes between 5 and 10 microns, which makes the alignment of multiple sites difficult when considering the dimensional thermal instability of a much larger alignment fixture to an active array of emitters or detectors The advantages of singlemode fiber over larger core multimode are many, but in general offer much higher bandwidth which is needed to meet the increasing data volume and transfer rates of future information systems. The ideas envisioned for the integration of MEMs with VCSELs include active alignment of either fibers, mirrors or lenses to active emitters and detectors. The feasibility of incorporating all on a single substrate poses serious technical challenges. However, the idea of a MEM structure physically translating an optical fiber over several microns offers the packaging community advantages over current methods. Another advantage of the MEMs alignment method is the ability to scale to much larger multi-element configurations. Micro Alignment Manipulator Architectures (MAMAs) offer a solution to the packaging community to economically produce high speed parallel optical networking systems.",391,2644,1,No,No,No,,1) Investigate the feasibility of a MEM device to physically manipulate the alignment of an optical fiber to an active VCSEL. 2) Develop a MEMs design that would be capable of performing an active alignment task between a single element VCSEL and a single optical fiber. 3) Fabricate and demonstrate the 1-D design. 4) Recommend a 2-D design for active alignment of multiple elements.

For example, space- and airborne imagery sources are increasing in number without a corresponding increase in the number of human image interpreters. (In fact, there is serious concern regarding the decrease in both the number and experience level of military imagery analysts.) For example, multi-spectral images are increasingly available, but no standard for human viewing of multi-spectral images has yet been developed. Both the military and commercial sectors have made large investments in algorithms for the automated exploitation of multi-spectral imagery. Many of these algorithms employ non-intuitive computations (such as the ratio between pixel intensities in specific wavelength bands or pattern recognition schema employing neural networks). The human analyst is provided with no capability to verify the results of the automation. These problems will only be exacerbated as hyper- and ultra-spectral imaging systems continue to mature. This topic seeks proposals to discover new image display processing and operator interface technologies based on human and biological image processing. Human and other biological systems are known to process images in multiple spectral bands that are held in registration during target recognition and navigation. Further, many of the processing steps of human vision are known and have been formally described, often in terms of algorithms for image processing. This topic encourages the extension of algorithmic descriptions of human multi-spectral image processing to the domain of image display processing. The overall technology objective is a display of (fused and/or otherwise preproceesed) multi-spectral images with measurable advantages for human tasks of interpretation, orientation, and information extraction. Secondary technology objectives include real-time image processing, feature and target segmentation, and wearable, head-mounted, displays. Technology challenges include: (1) spatial registration of multi-spectral static and moving image streams, (2) dynamic range compression or normalization to prevent display saturation, (3) false coloring of fused images for improved human image segmentation and target recognition, (4) benchmark tasks to enable quantitative comparison of various solutions to problems of human image processing performance in recognition and exploitation.

Decisions made early in the weapons systems acquisition process are typically without benefit of adequate consideration of the human. There is a need for representing the human interaction with complex automated systems in a way that will provide meaningful information to decision-makers involved in this process. The project will produce a technology for representing the behavior of individuals and teams, and for yielding explicit, operationally-credible, human-performance measures that can be directly linked to system effectiveness measures in engagement and mission-level constructive analyses. The scope is a technique for defining the limits of human performance that must be supported by the system interface (e.g., ""the human interface must allow the operator to identify the target in less than two seconds, at a range of..."") in order to satisfy overall system effectiveness objectives given the environment and other system performance parameters (and vice versa); it is not intended for defining the interface itself.

Also, it may be possible to combine a HUD light engine within a color head-down display (direct view or projection). Reliability improvements will significantly reduce expensive HUD maintenance actions. Present day HUDs use cathode-ray-tubes (CRTs) to produce the image.

Civil aircraft fitted with HUDs are being certified to CAT III allowing them to land in almost zero visibility. The successful completion of this project could make HUDs viable for all types of military and civil aircraft. Similarly, the automotive industry is interested in installing advanced HUDs in production automobiles. Head-Up Displays are not now fitted in many aircraft (nor in most automobiles) primarily because of their high cost, size, and weight.",1,"D.D. Desjardins and D.G.

The software will use the existing, computerized, AFRL model of DCS risk which is statistically based on AFRL research data and mathematically based on a system of partial differential equations describing bubble growth. High altitude exposure in aircraft, hypobaric chambers and with extravehicular activity (EVA) in space results in an inherent risk of decompression sickness (DCS). In the past, general guidelines for safer altitude exposures have been developed through costly, time-consuming studies, each specific to unique scenarios of altitude exposure. Rapidly changing technology in aircraft design and mission requirements e.g., high altitude air drops, demand improved capabilities in predetermining and immediately determining an individual's decompression risk assessment. Unlike the diving community, a standardized method for altitude decompression sickness risk determination does not presently exist. In 1990, a new bubble growth algorithm and a statistical model based on the existing DCS Database were initiated at Brooks AFB. The first version of this combined model was completed in 1996 and several papers have been submitted for publication. The model is being validated and is expected to be available in January, 1999. Information on the data required for a proposal may be obtained by calling the author. At that time, an updated version of the model, based on the validation, will be produced and software development can be initiated. Utilization of such software and hardware is anticipated in cockpits, in hyperbaric chamber control stations, in EVA suits, in commercial and private general aviation aircraft, as well as mission planning computers for high altitude operations.

Initial and sustainment training of active duty, guard, and reserve warfighters poses major problems and challenges to the military services. Training warfighter personnel in academic schools (ground-based training), simulator training, flight training, and on-the-job training requires scheduling, tracking and systematic evaluation of individual and team performance. Field commanders and supervisors must know who has the requisite training in order to identify the most appropriate individuals or teams to be deployed to the field. Scheduling and tracking students is a major issue especially for guard and reserve units that also must meet the same training requirements as active duty. All training programs, whether lecture or automated, require training management to support individual training and team training evaluation. Most training management systems support maintenance training from an individual perspective. With an eye on the downsizing of the military, team training of aircrews, space operations, and even team training of maintenance personnel is a driving force and primary focus of all military services. An automated means of identifying required sustainment and core-task training requirements and for managing and tracking formal and field (on-the-job) training completion and certification is a critical necessity. The Air Force's present capabilities in scheduling, tracking and evaluation for this type of training are completely inadequate. A training management system must be capable of making decisions in scheduling and tracking performance of individuals as well as teams. Currently, training management systems cannot make decisions and are not conducive to changes with having a system failure forcing instructors to schedule by hand. Some of the primary factors relevant to training management are administration, resources, curriculum, courseware, scheduling, evaluation, remediation, training reports generation, configuration, and logistics. Students have requirements that interfere with training and a training management system must comply and be able to make decisions for rescheduling. The system must be able to run on a desktop Pentium Level PC and be easily used by instructor/training personnel. Intelligent agent and intelligent programming architectures are at a point of technological maturity today to facilitate their application for this effort. Intelligent decision making for scheduling and tracking has not been accomplished at the team training level but now presents itself as a great opportunity for research in this area.",390,2732,1,No,No,No,,"The end product for Phase I shall be a fully functional, computer-based prototype demonstrating scheduling, tracking, and performance assessment of individual students and students in a team training environment.

These studies encompass thousands of tests conducted with both human volunteers and instrumented manikins performed over a span of more than 30 years. Results of these studies have been used to enhance the safety of escape system and crash protection design and to provide data for models which are used to predict the potential of injury. Data from these tests include biodynamic accelerations, forces, and displacement time histories, along with subject anthropometry measurements. These data have been integrated into a large in-house data repository which has been named the Biodynamics Data Bank (BDB). The time history files of all tests in the BDB are stored in an MS Excel format, along with tables and queries in an MS Access data base. The BDB will become part of a comprehensive Biodynamics Work Environment (BWE), which has been envisioned to give researchers the capability to easily access all these data and integrate them with biodynamic models in order to quickly solve problems in the areas of human safety and performance. This topic addresses the need for integrating the BDB with injury models and criteria which can be used to assess the probability of injury during impact acceleration stresses, with particular focus on neck and spinal injury. The injury models can be selected from current or modified models already in use or newly developed ones. They should address the effects of both the duration and magnitude of applied acceleration pulses and/or resulting loads and moments. Equations on which the models are based should be furnished along with information on why the model is appropriate, andREFERENCEs provided if a currently accepted model is employed (e.g. Head Injury Criterion (HIC), Dynamic Response Index (DRI), etc.). The software should be sufficiently flexible to allow the researcher to select the most appropriate injury criteria level for the model (e.g. Mertz, Yamada, etc.), and whenever possible provide the user with multiple probability of injury level curves (e.g., 1 percent, 5 percent , 50 percent, etc.). The software should be able to interface directly with the BDB by allowing the researcher to input acceleration, force, or moment time history or peak data files in MS Excel format.

These are the development of seat cushions with improved comfort, full crew population accommodation, and ejection compatibility; a full crew population accommodating restraint system with pelvic retraction and commanded haul back capability; and a passive head/neck restraint system for use with existing and future ejection seats. Extended missions in fighter aircraft have made lack of comfort associated with the present Advanced Concept Ejection Seat (ACES) II cushions no longer tolerable. Since these cushions were designed in the 1970's, the automotive industry has made great strides in improving seat comfort. However, the dynamic characteristics of automobile seats are inappropriate for ejection seats where the cushions must not contribute to increased injury during catapult acceleration. A safe, comfortable cushion design must accommodate the full Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) pilot population as well. During some flight maneuvers it is possible for the pilot to be lifted out of the seat because the current PCU-15 restraint has little negative G restraint and marginal lateral restraint. Small females are typically even less well restrained. During flight maneuvers when pilots are out of position, they would benefit from an inertia reel, which has a commanded haul back feature to reestablish proper seat contact and flight control interface. Ideally the restraint system should give the pilot freedom to move during flight, e.g. to ""check-six"" etc., and should provide both upper torso and pelvic retraction to properly position the pilot for safe escape. Full accommodation is a must. Ejection at high speed exposes the crewmember to injurious aerodynamic forces on the head/neck. New helmet-mounted systems make matters worse. A passive head/neck protection system is needed to counteract these aerodynamic forces and allow helmet-mounted systems to provide their considerable performance advantages without compromising safety during ejection.",298,2050,1,No,No,No,,"Develop initial designs and associated analysis to select the most promising approach.

Meeting this demand with current technologies results in storage systems that dominate processors in terms of overall cost, power consumption, volume and weight. Recognizing these and other problems inherent to high data rate, high density data storage and associative retrieval, the Air Force Research Lab Information Directorate is investigating erasable optical disk and multi-dimensional volumetric memory technologies. These technologies offer great promise due to their high data densities and their inherent parallelism in recording and readout, but in order to take full advantage of this, data transport systems must be designed to successfully integrate these mass storage systems with existing computer networks, with minimal data bottlenecking and latency. This effort seeks to exploit the recent advances made in the field of nano-technology in order to increase bit storage density to at least 1 Tb/cm3. Organic polymers, synthetic DNA, and covalent transition metal compounds all have shown the potential to increase storage densities by orders of magnitude. The challenge is to fabricate them on a nano-scale and then address (write/read) them at room temperature. It is projected that these systems will yield aggregate data rates on the order of 1-10 Gb/s. These extremely high bit densities and data rates however, necessitate a totally innovative search paradigm for accurately minimizing latency times. The development of associative retrieval algorithms will insure that data is transported within a cognitive bandwidth, i.e., minimum information needed to identify and/or understand data. Another area of growing interest involves optimally utilizing these inherently parallel memories in traditional serial network scenarios. This should be done in a way that maximizes the net throughput rate to all users, while minimizing system complexity. The problem can be broken up into three different areas. First, hardware issues are of great interest. Traditional electronic transmission lines may not work well at these data rates. Fiber optics have shown a lot of promise in this area, as shown by the newly designed HIPPI-6400 standards. Additionally, modulators and detectors designed to allow one to one imaging would simplify the optical design of memory systems. Free space optics may be a long term solution as well, not only for their very high data bandwidth, but also since they can be used for parallel processing applications. Second, software issues become critical in terms of manipulating these large pages of data. Tied closely to this are data protocol issues. This includes optimizing the parallel-to-serial conversion to minimize data bottlenecking, finding the optimal block size to perform error corrections, selecting optimal page sizes, etc.",433,2932,1,No,No,No,,"Consists of concept definition with experimentation adequate for feasibility demonstration.

This work will focus on development of technology for the detailed evaluation and in-depth analysis of data related to computer crime, unauthorized computer use, and military and industrial espionage activity.","Classically, computer forensics is a narrowly defined technology area focusing solely on the process of evidence extraction from computer media that has been seized by law enforcement authorities as part of an investigation into illegal or criminal activities. We, however, view computer forensics as encompassing a broader area of technology which includes processes from both the Detect and React paradigms of the broader information assurance technology area. In that context, computer forensics is an emerging technology that is concerned with a continuum of activities spanning the spectrum from the collection of audit and intrusion data to classic evidence reconstruction for legal purposes. Forensics, therefore, includes intrusion detection data gathering, assessing damage resulting from information attacks, locating hidden and disguised files, and data recovery from malicious (as opposed to) inadvertent destructive activity. In addition to the traditional tools used by computer forensics examiners, other tools such as intrusion-detection tools, computer auditing tools, and network management tools provide additional relevant evidence and information. A purely military application for this technology could be automated rapid exploitation of data contained in adversary computers seized during swift military operations. The work will address the reconstruction of evidence from computers where the data/files have been intentionally or maliciously destroyed or modified for the purpose of concealing an illegal activity. Other conditions under which forensics tools could provide assistance are detection of modified system binaries, identification of malicious programs, discovering indications of sniffer activity on a specific system, and identification of various foul play indicators such as modified system logs and ""backdoors"". Technologies sought under this program include: techniques for handling password-protected files; methods for locating and decrypting of encrypted files; procedures for uncovering data hidden within seemingly innocuous data (steganography); tools for searching for hidden and disguised files, file filters for reducing both the search space and time for forensics investigation of large media; tools for maintaining the integrity of the forensics process while managing the forensics workflow.

Intelligence ""wandering through memory"" will lead to very large information stores organized around thousands of DRAM chips which will dynamically (re)configure according to function. Techniques such as data aggregation/dissemination, prefetching data, restructuring data based on locality and rapid fetching of data from main memory will be used to configure dynamic data/knowledge processing. Adaptive memory techniques in conjunction with advanced data structures could provide innovative ways to both access and store various forms of data/knowledge. In the past data repositories (databases) were viewed as static stores of information that had to be identified, retrieved, and sent to a central analysis process. The data intensive paradigm is that the data stays in place, and the analysis processes come to the data. Techniques are needed to provide ways data should be dynamically structured and stored for efficient retrieval as well as provide adaptable transformation techniques to structure knowledge which can be managed more efficiently so that information can be automatically filtered, manipulated and summarized. The ability to efficiently develop such configurable intelligent data systems relies significantly on the development of new concepts for transforming functions into dynamic processes that automate and improve how to integrate and analyze information, make decisions under uncertainty and communicate knowledge. The result will dramatically improve data access capability within computing environments and perform situation analysis of relevant data and/or information/knowledge.

Missions using modern payloads have pushed the limits of on-orbit collection capabilities, but satellite downlinks, constrained by low power transmitters omni-directional antennas, and power/thermally constrained duty cycles are seriously deficient in throughput capability.

Most spacecraft radio frequency (RF) systems are designed to downlink in the worst case, ensuring reliable transmission. This fixes a low, safe data rate that will close a link in: 1) The furthest slant range (highest path loss attenuation), 2) Lowest elevations with respect to the ground station (normally 5 degrees), and 3) 95% worst day for weather (high atmospheric losses).

In terrestrial networks, a user node often is connected to the network by a fixed link, the capacity of which may greatly exceed the cumulative demands of the virtual connections originating from the node. The node is responsible for exercising usage parameter control (UPC) to meet the specified traffic limitations. In networks that include satellite links, link capacity is an expensive resource that must be used as efficiently as possible. Consequently, the capacity from a user node may be negotiated on an as-needed basis. Tailoring the uplink capacity from a node to match the expected traffic acts as an implicit form of UPC. In a network providing virtual circuits with guaranteed quality of service, no specific resources are assigned to a connection. Therefore, the decision whether to admit a new connection is based on a statistical assessment of the consistency of the resulting cumulative traffic from both the new and the existing virtual connections and the quality of service guarantees for those connections.

Similarly, with the emergence of a myriad of commercial personal communications services (PCS), highly efficient utilization of available commercial frequency spectrum is paramount. In order to satisfy the growing demand on military communications capability (with a static and possibly shrinking spectral allocation) stringent requirements are placed on the signaling waveforms to be used on future satellite communications systems. Specifically, the waveforms must be bandwidth efficient, as well as power efficient, and must be robust enough to withstand jamming and other types of interference. In addition, it is highly desirable to have the modulator/demodulator as simple to implement as possible. For the commercial service providers, newly available frequency spectrum is obtained at great expense (as evidenced by the recent PCS-band auction, which totaled billions of dollars). The only way for the commercial service providers to recover such staggering initial costs and eventually become profitable is to maximize the capacity of the commercial systems. This again implies the need for bandwidth and power efficient modulation waveforms. One class of waveforms that is known to be highly spectral and power efficient is Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK). Theoretical analyses have shown that in order to satisfy military spectral and capacity requirements the bandwidth-time (BT) product of the GMSK waveform must be sufficiently low (<0.2), and the order of the modulation must be 4 or greater. With current state of the art technology, optimum receivers for such waveforms are prohibitively complex to implement.

A coded channel requires much less power to achieve a given bit error rate (BER) than an uncoded channel. The cost of this ëcoding gainí is an expansion of the bandwidth required to transmit the information (i.e. the amount of bandwidth expansion, for a given bit error rate, is a function of the code rate). Over the years, many different coding schemes have been investigated by various researchers and several of these codes have become de facto 'industry standards' due to their exceptional coding gain and/or ease of implementation. Successful coding schemes include the families of convolutional codes, Reed-Solomon codes, and 'concatenate' codes consisting of constituent codes form each of the aforementioned families. In general, the concatenated codes provided the highest coding gains and were commonly used in power-limited systems with low BER requirements. In recent times, the military and the commercial sectors have both experienced the intensified utilization of multimedia services, such as electronic mail, video conferencing, and the World Wide Web. As each of these services imposes added demand on system resources, the need for coding schemes with even greater coding gains have become apparent. In recent years, a new class of powerful codes, referred to as 'turbo codes' has been invented. Based on published results, turbo codes could provide greater coding gains than any other known code. Turbo encoders are simple variations/extensions of existing codes; the decoders, however, are more complex and have not yet been successfully field tested.

A growing number of DOD and industry efforts are beginning to prove this technologyís promise of widespread software reuse, low-cost platform requirements, and rapid design-to-field cycle time. The reusable nature of components is the backbone behind their innovation. The commitment of companies such as Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, and IBM, to deliver end-to-end solutions for building and operating distributed component applications is enormous. If each solution were based on a single component standard, the specification for implementing and invoking a componentís functions, a component developer could use a mixture of cross-vendor products to build and execute the application. However, because the stakes are so high in becoming the defacto standard, the market has divided into three competing technologies for distributed component applications ñ Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), and Java. While each group is rapidly advancing their component-based product line, application developers are left with the decision of which technology to embrace. The creation of a component framework, which transcends the competing component standards, will enable application developers to assemble applications from components written by any vendor, in any language, using any interface standard, for their particular infrastructure. This would maximize the chief contribution of component-based development ñ leveraging other developerís efforts to construct powerful, inexpensive, and robust applications in record time frames. A developer focused on a Windows NT environment, geared to support DCOM, could still use components created by another developer who focused on a Unix environment supporting CORBA. The commitment of the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE) community to Windows NT and Unix platforms makes DII COE an obvious target for a component framework specification.

Current materials, such as nitrile and fluorosilicone, that can seal at such temperatures are very prone to compression set. In a relatively short period of time the seals lose their elasticity and, consequently, their ability to seal. The current fuel system seals are required to be resistant to all types of aircraft jet fuels, including JP-4, JP-5, JP-8 and Jet A. They are required to operate at temperatures between -650F and 1600F at low pressures. Recent advances in aircraft thermal management have increased the return temperatures of the fuel to 2250F. Therefore, new materials should be capable of sealing from -650F to 2500F. Since the Air Force converted to JP-8 fuel, there has been a debate to raise the low temperature to -400F. This is because JP-8 has a slush temperature of about -500F. Proposals for a good compression set resistant material that has a -400F to 2500F operating range will be considered. Current aircraft hydraulic systems normally operate in the -650F to 2750F temperature range at pressures of 3000 to 4000 psi. The weakness of the elastomeric materials requires the use of plastic back-up rings to prevent extrusion of the seals at high pressures. The low temperature requirement in some systems is -400F and other current systems that require -650F may relax the temperature requirement to -400F. Therefore, proposals for compression set resistant materials that can achieve a -400F to 2750F will be considered. Nitrile seals are heavily plasticized in order to obtain the low temperature capability; however, this also makes the material very weak especially in the area of compression set. Both hydraulic seal and fuel seal formulations are effected by this. However, there are some recent developments with hydrogenated nitrile materials that may make it possible to develop a low temperature compression set resistant material. Fluorosilicone seals that are used in fuel systems are also very compression set prone due to the inherent weakness of the material backbone. Fluorocarbon materials have not been able to achieve the low temperature requirements. Even the low temperature formulations do not obtain a -400F sealability. This material is very good in every other way and would be the material of choice if the low temperature requirements could be met without giving up on any of the other properties.",400,2498,1,No,No,No,,"Define, determine feasibility, and show proof of concept for preliminary low temperature and compression set resistant hydraulic and fuel seal materials.

Charge dissipation has been successfully implemented in the softer, more pliable worksurfaces (Type II and Type III of MIL-PRF-87893B). These materials are made from polyvinyl and rubber doped with conductive ingredients. Although the current hard laminates (Type I) possess acceptable resistance values in the range of 1 x 106 to 1 x 109 ohms, they do not dissipate charge from items placed upon them. This is most likely due to high contact resistance between the aluminum disk and the worksurface. The complete test methods for evaluating charge dissipation and other electrical properties of all three types of worksurfaces are described in MIL-PRF-87893B. Most of the current hard laminates for counter tops are made from thermoses melamine resin impregnated into paper products and formed under high pressure and heat. A variety of electrically conductive components (fibers, ions, salts, etc.) have been added into a subsurface portion of the laminate to promote charge dissipation. The surface resistance of the very topmost layer may be a key to passing the Charge Dissipation Test. Conductive organic polymers which are compatible with melamine resin may reduce the surface resistance. Hard laminate surfaces are preferred over softer surfaces for their durability (i.e., cut, puncture, and abrasion resistance) cleanability and writing surface. Humidity is known to affect the ability of a surface to dissipate electric charge. A surface is more likely to fail to dissipate a charge at 10% rather than 50% relative humidity. Air Force electronics are particularly vulnerable to electrostatic discharge (ESD) because they are often exposed to very dry or very cold conditions that promote static discharge.",282,1869,1,No,No,No,,Identify materials that effectively overcome the surface phenomena mentioned above and additionally meet all performance requirements of MIL-PRF-87893B in a cost effective manner.

Recent scientific advances, however, have demonstrated by atomic force microscopy that truly monolayer (one molecule thick) films of conductive polymers can be formed on glass and silicon substrates, and that such films are electrically contiguous. Some monolayer films have been shown to be so mechanically robust that they cannot be removed from the substrates even with vigorous mechanical force.

The design approach has application to many functional areas: guidance fuzing integration for mass focused ordnance technology, guidance control integration for reduced radar cross section of cruise missiles, and anti-jam GPS capability based on body shading. The specific application of integrated guidance for this program is to investigate the feasibility and demonstrate an anti-jam GPS capability based on exploitation of body shading. It is currently common to select a GPS receiver antenna and place it on a guided munition air-frame in such a way as to minimize acquisition time and the effects of ground based jammers. Basically the antenna system is placed in such a way as to maximize the GPS signal received during a typical mission scenario. It is possible to exploit this same concept during the guidance maneuvers of the vehicle as well. Since the GPS satellites and jammers are typically not co-located, the air-frame can be steered so that the antenna gain pattern is pointed where satellites are located. This concept can also be used to maximize GPS accuracy by optimizing antenna direction relative to the satellite constellation. Current guidance algorithms do not directly attempt to actively exploit the above concepts. In the past, guidance algorithms for munitions have focused on minimizing miss distance or maximizing kinetic energy at impact; the increasing reliance on GPS for navigation suggests these new criteria for optimal guidance involving the minimization of the jamming energy received at the antenna. This method of anti-jam GPS is significantly different than the signal processing techniques which are commonly employed.",273,1790,1,No,No,No,,The first portion of this project will be an investigation that quantifies the benefit of using the effects of body-shading to provide some level of anti-jam GPS capability. The concept is to develop a full envelope guidance algorithm that satisfies both initial and final conditions for a ground fixed target and exploits body-shading. The Phase I portion of this program should deliver a guided munition simulation incorporating the guidance algorithm. The Phase I effort should investigate the sensing requirements (what sort of knowledge ((accuracy)) is required on the location of the jammers) for this sort of anti-jam technique.,"The second phase of this project should apply the guidance algorithm developed under Phase I to a representative piece of hardware. Selection of GPS antenna/receiver and experimental identification of the antenna gain as a function of vehicle orientation will be required. A proposed air-frame would be the diamond-back Miniature Munition Technology Demonstration (MMTD), although the Phase I effort may identify a better candidate. These experimental results would then be used for detailed simulation of the concept munition. Depending on cost, it would be desirable to incorporate signal processing techniques providing anti-jam capability for an integrated anti-jam solution.","The exploitation of anti-jam guidance algorithms based on exploitation of body shading would have direct application to the next MMTD system (scheduled to demonstrate an anti-jam capability.) In addition to the military application, the formulation of guidance algorithms that minimize non-standard cost functions has application in the area of robotics. Robots that search inhospitable regions (radioactive environments for example) would be able to use the concepts developed here directly. Such environments often have hazards that mathematically can be represented much the same way as GPS jammers.",1,"NAIC-ID(RS)T-0067-96, ""The United States Military Begins to Recognize the Susceptibility of the Global Positioning System to Jamming,"" Feb 1996.

The application of multimode/multispectral seekers to the smart weapons offers numerous performance benefits over traditional single-sensor implementations. Every seeker has its own peculiar set of advantages and disadvantages when implemented on smart munitions. Frequently, however, individual advantages complement each other such that disadvantages are overcome. The object, then, is to fuse these advantages in an optimal manner. In order to exploit sensor fusion, scene and target registrations are required among the seeker channels. The combining of data or information requires the registration algorithm to account for measurement uncertainty in characteristics shared by the seeker channels as well as in characteristics unique to each seeker channel.

However, non-linear optical techniques have not generally been used in the receive path where the return pulse is simply focused onto an appropriate detector, and gain in the detector amplifies the signal produced. We propose to investigate the use of non-linear optical techniques in novel ways to explore their effects on system performance. For example, by using an optical amplifier in the return path, the intensity of the return pulse can be modulated before it is focused onto a detector. A particular advantage of such a design would be the ability to optically modulate the effective gain of the receiver, allowing for the exploration of various LADAR detection techniques (e.g. range-gating, coherent detection of intensity modulated pulses, etc.) A range-gating implementation would be useful in improving the performance of LADAR in weather. Another example is to use non-linear optical devices to convert the return pulse to a wavelength region where better detectors are available, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the electronic signal produced. Such a device might allow the use of eyesafe (> 1.5 micron) laser outputs, while leveraging the excellent performance characteristics of silicon detectors (which have a cutoff around 1 micron). There are many possibilities for transceiver designs that utilize various non-linear devices to achieve novel imaging LADAR approaches. Desirable characteristics include compact designs appropriate for non-laboratory environments, eyesafe operation, multiple wavelength operation, and wavelength tunable output.

Polarization imaging holds promise for providing significant improvements in contrast in a number of target detection and discrimination applications. Polarization signatures arise from the preferential emission or reflection of light in the planes perpendicular and parallel to a target surface. Polarization signatures are dependent on the wavelength, the surface properties (index of refraction and surface roughness), external sources, and the geometry of the sensor, the surface, and the sources. In several experimental systems, significant contrast has been demonstrated that complements the conventionally imaged signature. However, these experimental systems frequently require long data acquisition times resulting in artifacts in the polarization signature due to changes in the scene. Additionally, calibration and investigation of systematic errors in these systems is difficult and robust calibration procedures have not been fully demonstrated. Proper calibration requires accurate laboratory instrumentation to characterize the full polarizing properties of the polarization critical optical components in the polarization imagers. Laboratory instrumentation is also required to better characterize target and background materials and understand the variation of polarization signatures with wavelength, geometry, and material property. The goal of the Munitions Directorate is to investigate novel imaging polarimeter concepts that measure some or all of the polarization parameters and address advanced seeker requirements for speed and sensitivity.

Laser radars are useful tools for a variety of commercial and military applications. Current long-range LADAR systems rely on one of two basic schemes for finding the distance to an object: a pulsed direct detection scheme which measures the photon time-of-flight, or a scheme which measures distance based on coherent mixing of an intensity modulated output and/or return. Each of these schemes has drawbacks and limitations. For example, direct detection devices typically use single element detectors (especially at wavelengths greater than one micron) that must be scanned in order to produce 3D imagery. Slow scanning results in low imagery frame rates. Improving LADAR performance over the state-of-the-art can be accomplished either by improving the components that make up a current LADAR system, or basing a system on a new technique for range measurement. Likewise, reducing the cost of LADAR systems may be achieved through component cost reduction, or designing new systems that are inherently cheaper than existing ones. This topic invites proposals that pursue any of these paths. Proposals should address research into a new or lower-cost component for use in an existing LADAR scheme, or research into a new technique expected to result in improved performance or reduced system cost. Current LADAR components include lasers, optical detectors, optical scanners, transmit and receive optics, and ranging electronics. Techniques which lend themselves to implementation in compact packages are of great interest. Furthermore, techniques and components that can be used at near-IR to mid-IR wavelengths may allow more eyesafe operation of LADAR systems. Exploration of multi-spectral LADAR components and systems is encouraged. Proposals need not cover every aspect of a LADAR system design, but should contain enough information to make clear how the proposed component or technique fits in to a LADAR scheme that is appropriate for imaging targets at distances on the order of 1 km (or greater).

Recently, increased emphasis has been placed on using high-speed, two-dimensional detector arrays to gather range and intensity images. The use of a detector array enables high (e.g. video) frame rates and reduces or eliminates mechanical scanning requirements for certain short range applications. Our LADAR receiver architectures require two essential operating characteristics of a candidate receiver array: frame rates (i.e. array read out rates) greater than 30 Hz, and gain modulation at MHz rates. We currently have LADAR systems which use an image intensifier tube that illuminates a commercially available silicon CCD array to achieve these two characteristics. The image intensifier gain can be modulated at MHz rates, while the CCD can be read out at video rates. However, for munition seeker applications, it is desirable to eliminate the image intensifier tube to save on space, cost, and improve seeker durability. Furthermore, current image intensifier/CCD architectures are limited to operation in the visible spectrum, resulting in LADAR systems that are not eyesafe. Recent advances in Electron Bombarded CCD (EBCCD) technology have made it an attractive candidate for use in LADAR receivers. Since the photocathode material is an intrinsic part of the device, it would eliminate the need for an image intensifier tube in a LADAR receiver architecture. In EBCCD devices, gain modulation can be achieved by modulating the photocathode voltage. The underlying silicon CCD array should allow for video read out rates. This topic seeks proposals that would conduct research and development into EBCCD technologies, ultimately leading to the fabrication and delivery of an EBCCD device for use in a LADAR receiver. Such a device should have an array of at least 256x256 pixels, a frame rate of 30 Hz or better, and the ability to modulate the gain at a 10 MHz rate.

A machine running at higher speed can usually attain a higher power density and lower weight. However, a high power density motor or generator poses difficult technical challenges generally associated with the generation of high heat loads from magnetic and electrical losses and windage. Proposals are solicited which offer ways to either reduce these heat loads, or to ameliorate their effects. Examples of areas of interest include, but are not limited to, high temperature windings and potting materials (>400 degrees C, 600 degrees C goal) for switched reluctance machines (SRMs), fault tolerant winding configurations for permanent magnet (PM) generators, non-lubricated active or passive rotor suspension systems (including hybrids) for APUs, and on-line diagnostic approaches for monitoring/controlling APU rotor/bearing system stability. Innovative thermal management concepts are sought in the areas of high power electronics and rotating machine cooling. More Electric Aircraft (MEA) power system components possess unique environments which preclude conventional cooling approaches. Concepts that integrate the cooling and electronics package are desired for their effective and compact nature. In general, passive concepts are desired over active concepts. Passive thermal management concepts for high performance aircraft have the potential of being reliable and simplistic in design, and are therefore preferred. However, such concepts must manage the inherent coupling of transient heat generation and transient acceleration-induced forces, and their effects on the cooling performance of the device. When active cooling is proposed, air is the most desirable coolant while existing aircraft fluids such as JP-8 fuel, polyalphaolefin, or MIL-standard lubricants will suffice if the cooling system is conceived as a line replaceable unit (LRU) or is modular. Reduction of Life Cycle Costs (LCC) should be a key objective for all efforts. For air cooling, low pressure drop approaches that are integral with the electronics package are desirable. The effects of altitude or the impact of the use of compressor bleed air must be addressed when air cooling is proposed. Areas of interest include but are not limited to, two-phase cooling, immersion cooling, heat pipes, heat exchangers with enhanced heat transfer surfaces, and the use of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) to control and enhance interfacial heat transfer.

In hybrid propulsion, unlike a solid rocket motor, fuel and oxidizer are separated until mixed in a combustion chamber. Innovative approaches are needed to create oxidizers and expulsion systems that meet requirements for future missiles systems.

An OTV based on a high specific impulse solar rocket engine has the ability to deliver twice the payload to GEO as current chemical upper stages. Solar rocket engines generally consist of two paraboloid reflectors which concentrate sunlight into a small high temperature heat exchanger. Hydrogen gas is heated by flowing through the exchanger and produces thrust by accelerating out a nozzle. To be practical for AF missions, the mass and packaging volume of the OTV must be kept to a minimum. This has led to the use of thin film inflatable concentrators and suppoprt struts that deploy and rigidize once in orbit. The concentrators consist of two films attached at the edge to form a clamshell. The first film simply holds the very low pressure gas against the second film that is the reflector. To make this type of reflector viable, it must be able to deploy and maintain a shape to a fairly tight accuracy. It must also have sufficient stiffness to be controllable and be resistant to the space environment. This includes micro-meteroids, atomic oxygen, and UV radiation. Novel ideas such as methods to rigidize the thin film are needed to provide 30-day life requirement. Other areas of interest are ways to keep the films from tearing, ways to self seal punctures, ideas to keep wrinkles fron forming during packaging, and ways to fine tune the support struts once in orbit. There is also a need for a method of measuring or sensing the shape and accuracy of the concentrator once deployed. This would allow a space experiment to deploy an inflatable reflector and determine the shape and optical path qualities including reflectivity, vibrations, wrinkling, shape error, pointing errors, and support effects. Another major component ripe for innovative solutions is the high temperature heat exchanger. Operational systems need to run between 2000K and 3500K. This presents the challenge of designing and manufacturing a device which can operate at the temperature, be compatible with hydrogen, and provide hundreds of cycles and hundreds of hours of operation over a 30- day mission. Furthermore, the design must get as much of the energy to the propellant as possible. This requires very good high temperature insulation, a very small entrance aperature to the exchanger, a high ratio of absortivity to emissivity, or a design that can perform efficiently without one of those. Generally, a secondary optic is placed at the entrance aperature to further concentrate the incoming sunlight. Although its smaller size makes weight less of a concern, the reflectivity is very important and it must operate at moderately high temperatures or be designed to operate cool in close proximity to the high temperature exchanger. Due to the multi-impulse burn profile of the solar OTC concept, a heat storage device can have attractive benefits. Hence, novel ideas concerning high temperature heat storage such as phase change materials are also of interest. There are issues needing attention which concern the ground testing of these engines. A method is needed to remotely monitor the surface temperature of the high temperature heat exchanger. This includes both the chamber and nozzle temperatures as viewed from down stream, and the absorbing surface of the exchanger which is flooded by intense sunlight. Furthermore, a characterization of the velocity profile of the exhaust plume is needed since the very small nozzle throat has significant influence on the flow.",589,3658,1,No,No,No,,"Analyze the design or idea and perform tradeoffs.

The PDE is considered advantageous for a wide range of propulsion applications ranging from boosters and upper stages through interceptor divert engines to micro-propulsion for spacecraft and Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV's). Such devices offer a range of potential advantages compared with traditional deflagration based propulsion systems, e.g., simplicity (few moving parts), low cost (through modular design), high performance with a wide range of fuels, high thrust-to-weight (no high pressure pumps and compressors), high turn down ratio, simple thrust vectoring, no requirement for exotic materials etc. Although a number of such devices are currently being fabricated and tested, validated design methods and scaling laws for PDE's do not exist. Nor, is there a demonstrated understanding of the parameters which control and limit achievable performance. The timely and successful development of pulse detonation propulsion devices will ultimately depend upon the resolution of these fundamental issues. This is especially true for PDE's based on liquid fuels (an attractive alternative to current gaseous-fueled systems) as the effect of fuel and injection characteristics on detonation initiation and deflagration-to-detonation transition are virtually unknown.

The technology area has usually been represented by Rocket Based Combined Cycle (RBCC) engines, also known as Air Augmented Rocket engines. Pulse Detonation Propulsion (PDP) technologies also may be ideally suited for multi-mode propulsion systems. In either case, the key advantages stem from the use of a single flow path for multiple operating modes. RBCC propulsion technologies have been demonstrated at various levels of maturity over the past few decades. Thus far, PDP technology development efforts have been conducted separately for rocket and airbreathing variants. Rocket PDP technologies are being developed for spacelift and orbital transfer applications. Airbreathing PDP technologies are being developed for very low cost propulsion systems. A multi-mode propulsion system should combine the high thrust loading of a rocket mode with the high efficiency of an airbreathing mode. The main benefit of a multi-mode engine, as opposed to separate rocket and airbreathing engines, would be the high volumetric efficiency and low weight of a single flow path used for multiple operating modes. Several applications appear to be suitable for multi-mode propulsion systems: A trans-atmospheric vehicle ascending to space would launch in rocket mode, transition to airbreathing mode for atmospheric acceleration, and then revert to rocket mode for spaceflight. The airbreathing mode would also be used for atmospheric cruise after reentry from orbit. A missile or unmanned aerial vehicle would launch and accelerate in rocket mode and then transition to airbreathing mode for atmospheric cruise. In this case, a multi-mode engine would eliminate the need for separate rocket booster and airbreathing sustainer propulsion systems. This effort will advance the state-of-the-art of multi-mode rocket-airbreathing propulsion technologies for military applications. Successful efforts will result in the development and demonstration of technologies for the entire propulsion system, including the following key subsets: Air induction (inlets, diffusers, compressors) Combustion (ramburners, thrust chambers, pulse initiators, pulse detonation tubes) Control (timing, sensors, diagnostics, operating modes) Nozzle (manifolds, mixers, expansion surfaces or devices) Propellant (fuels and oxidizers, preferably non-cryogenic) Propellant system (pumps, plumbing, heat exchangers, injectors) Structure (thermal protection, vibration control)",352,2554,1,No,No,No,,Predict the performance parameters and physical characteristics of one or more multi-mode propulsion system concepts.

Optical obscuration can be caused, for example, by turbulence/temperature interactions that cause a large random index of refraction variations, by dense sprays that are created at elevated pressures, or by large soot radiation signatures that tend to obscure the signal of interest. This topic seeks to take advantage of innovative new techniques that have recently been developed to perform optical diagnostics in opaque or turbid media. For instance, resonant imaging holography has been performed by tuning the light source to a resonant line of the structure to be imaged and subtracting out the non-resonant signal. Structures have been visualized inside containers of milk in this way. As another example, ballistic imaging techniques have been developed which take advantage of recent fast lasers and fast detectors, where the time of photon arrival can be correlated with the number of scattering encounters. Images have been obtained through 5mm of flesh is this latter case. Creative ideas are sought for applying techniques including, but not limited to, these examples to optically dense combustion flows.

Among these parameters are the fuel-air ratio, emissions indices, and combustion efficiency. Unfortunately the strategies currently in place for the determination of these parameters are inadequate for characterizing system performance. Combustion efficiency is a particularly difficult parameter to quantify for these advanced propulsion systems. Combustion efficiency is defined by the ratio of the energy released during the combustion process to the energy that would be realized were all the carbon in the fuel converted to carbon dioxide and all the hydrogen in the fuel converted to water vapor. Through measurements of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), total hydrocarbons (HC), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in the engine exhaust, combustion efficiency can be calculated on an enthalpy basis by accounting for inefficiencies due to the production of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons. Measurements are typically achieved through gas-sampling systems that employ flame-ionization, infrared-absorption, or chemiluminescent detection schemes. Unburned hydrocarbons are treated as methane, and probe-based measurements are averaged over time at numerous locations in the engine exit plane to account for temporal and spatial inhomogeneities. While this approach provides acceptable combustion efficiency measurements for current stateof-the-art gas turbine engines, advanced propulsion systems now under development are not adequately characterized through this measurement scheme. A number of specific measurement challenges exist. Advanced combustion efficiency measurements must address the many chemical forms assumed by unburned and partially burned hydrocarbons in the engine exhaust. Simply considering these emissions in terms of methane leads to unacceptable efficiency measurements. Pulsed detonation engines involve cyclical operation at frequencies up to several hundred cycles per second. This transient behavior demands innovative approaches to combustion efficiency measurement. Spatial inhomogeneities at the exit plane must also be addressed to achieve meaningful measurements. As engine operating temperatures approach stoichiometric conditions, dissociation processes and equilibrium concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the engine exhaust must be considered as well. Often the exhaust constituents to be determined are present at trace concentrations demanding highly sensitive measurement techniques.

Develop chemically reacting fuels which feature enhanced properties which are activated during discrete portions of the operational envelope.","Jet fuel is a primary coolant used to cool aircraft and engine subsystems on current and future aircraft. Current jet fuels (JP-8, JP-5) break down at high temperatures to form gums, varnishes and coke that can plug fuel nozzles, afterburner sprayrings and spraybars, fuel manifolds and fuel controls. Advanced propulsion concepts can require up to 1500 Btu/lb cooling from the fuel. To provide the necessary cooling the fuel must be resistant to degradation under both autoxidative and pyrolytic conditions and may be under supercritical or controlled cracking conditions (endothermic type fuels). In order to develop advanced high heat sink fuels, new fuel additives that suppress autoxidation and pyrolysis at temperatures as high as 450 Degrees C need to be developed. New test methods are needed to simulate the behavior of fuels at supercritical or cracking temperatures that can be used to determine fuel reaction chemistry, kinetics, heat transfer as well as chemical and physical properties at supercritical conditions. Advanced computational fluid dynamic models coupled with fuel degradation chemistry and advanced high temperature fuel system component simulators are required to determine the impact of fuel degradation in advanced aircraft and engine fuel systems. Jet aircraft produce chemical emissions that can be released into the atmosphere at high altitudes. Fuel additives that can be added to jet fuels in small quantities and suppress emissions need to be developed. Advanced emissions measuring techniques that can be used with research combustors to evaluate the effectiveness of these new fuel additives are also required. The composition of aviation fuels such as conventional Jet-A and military JP fuels is determined by specifications which are primarily based upon total operational requirements. However, both commercial and operational requirements vary as a function of time throughout a given mission. The most efficient commercial and military fuels would have enhanced properties only when required. Fuel is one of the most expensive components of the operational and support budget of weapon systems, and the primary cost of operating commercial airliners and ground vehicles. Hence, maximizing the use of available feedstocks while minimize use of specialty components to provide the desired enhanced performance has the potential of making high cost ""designer"" fuels affordable ($1 - $1.50/gallon range). One attractive application would be additives which generate desirable free radicals such as OH, H and O which initiate chain branching combustion reactions, and hence provide a technique to reduce ignition delay, increase combustion efficiency, and reduce undesirable pollutant emissions. Under the present program, innovative fuel additives are sought which react in the fuel system or the combustor to enhance a specific property. Examples of fuel properties requiring tailored enhancement include higher reactivity, emissions reduction characteristics, soot suppressants, improved thermal stability, enhanced heat sink, higher energy density, greater lubricity and low temperature supportability. The goals of Phase I are to identify suitable additives and demonstrate performance in a laboratory device such as a shock tube or benchtop fuel system simulator. A financial assessment to determine affordability must be considered. Analytical simulations should be used to screen potential additives, and use of the Major Shared Resource Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is encouraged in order to successfully address the multi-scalar nature intrinsic to chemical processes. The goals of Phase II would be to demonstrate the performance of the additives at true operating conditions in large scale combustors or fuel system simulators, and assess implementation costs. In Phase III, the small business would be able to market the additives to the Department of Defense, and the transportation industry (airlines and commercial gasoline vendors).",587,4000,1,No,No,No,,Demonstrate the feasibility of the technology and to quantify the payoffs for both military and commercial applications.,"Demonstrate the application of the technology, demonstrate a prototype of the technology, validate performance, and quantify payoffs for both military and commercial applications.",All technologies developed under this topic have both military and commercial jet fuel applications due to the similarities of the jet fuels (i.e. JP-8 is commercial Jet A-1 fuel with a military additive package).,1,"Heneghan, S.

Various optical ""flow"" diagnostics techniques are currently under development for eventual use in the harsh environments of direct connect and free jet facilities. The need still exists for the development of new techniques to allow accurate point or field measurements of velocity, temperature, density, fuel concentration, and the consistency of the exhaust effluence in hydrocarbon and hydrogen fueled ramjet and scramjet propulsion systems. These techniques are also vital to the development of CFD simulation software. Software development requires that accurate and precise measurements be performed concurrently with and in a complimentary fashion to algorithm development and physical model validation. Shortcomings exist in the simulation of chemical kinetics, turbulence, turbulence-chemistry interaction, multi-phase flow, unsteady effects and acoustic phenomena. New robust miniature instrumentation is required to assess the performance of potential subsonic and supersonic ramjet combustors and various flow path components in free jet and direct connect facilities. In particular, the development of micro-scale high frequency sensors for measurements of wall pressure, temperature, skin friction and heat flux capable of surviving high enthalpy (up to Mach 8) flight conditions is desirable.

Advanced designs are utilizing highly loaded, low aspect ratio, complex shape airfoils in multistage configurations. However, increased loading produces larger blade wakes, resulting in significant aerodynamic and aeromechanical interactions between stages. In addition, increased loading has produced stall margin and efficiency sensitivity to blade tip clearance levels. Aerodynamic and aeromechanical design capability does not fully account for the unsteady interactions, the effects of wakes due to complex airfoil shapes, or the sensitivity to tip clearances that exist in compression systems. Advanced measurement methods that improve the understanding of these phenomena are desired. In addition, innovative concepts that exploit an understanding of these phenomena are needed to meet the demands of future compression systems. Areas of prime technical importance include: endwall, wake and secondary flows; time unsteadiness, advanced data analysis; forced response and mistuning. Obtaining precise secondary gas path flow control will play an increasingly larger role in optimizing engine efficiency, as further gains in the major engine components become more difficult to achieve. Understanding primary and secondary gas path interactions can be critical to the performance of both. Reducing parasitic leakage and seal deterioration, while minimizing air needed for cooling, ventilation, and thrust balancing, is a significant challenge as the secondary gas path environment becomes more extreme. In addition, it is now anticipated that the cycle operating temperatures will dictate that cooled cooling air will be needed to maintain mechanical integrity in the turbine, and most likely in the compressor as well. Innovative concepts and models leading towards precise secondary gas path flow control are desired. Areas of particular interest include primary/secondary gas path interaction, film riding seals, trenching and shrouds, innovative thrust balancing, counter-rotation, and disk pumping.

They are often referred to as smart systems because of the use of local processing and feedback. This contrasts with state-of-the-art (SOA) systems, which may operate open loop, or use feedback from parameters sensed at a distance, such as is done in modern engine control. Implementation of these strategies will significantly improve the performance of future engine components, such as the compressor, combustor, and turbine, including the fuel system.

Under this system, the correlator data is fed into the tracking loops where it is processed into pseudorange and delta pseudorange measurements. These tracking loops make no use of the inter-satellite statistical properties of phase, frequency, and delay processes. As a result, the system loses performance in the reference waveform alignment process. When the GPS signal power is rapidly varying, this loss is further amplified and can even lead to an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) bias state contamination. Also, as a result of the post loop observables, the observables are non-white. This forces the IMU update rates to be slower than GPS loop aiding rates and detracts from the coupling with an IMU. By implementing an approach to use the correlator data directly in the Kalman filter, these inherent weaknesses of the current tracking loop design should be avoided. In this effort, the contractor will develop and demonstrate a method to achieve this correlator output use in the Kalman filter directly, thus eliminating the conventional tracking loops.

A methodology is needed for characterizing clutter (i.e., any non-target region of an image) as part of solving both the FAR reduction and estimation problems. Proposals are sought for innovative methods of characterizing clutter from air-to-ground Laser Radar (Ladar) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. Ladar is of special interest for initial exploration of clutter characterization methodologies because of its high discrimination potential and relatively simple phenomenology. SAR is of special interest because of a substantial ATR technology base and the readily available measured and synthetic data. Proposers are encouraged to consider target sets that focus on military ground vehicles. The characterization of clutter is expected to depend on the sensor, the feature suite, and the target set of interest (""clutter"" is, after all, defined as ""not-target""). Challenges associated with FAR reduction include large variability in the target class images (e.g., from configuration variations or obscuration), a large number of target classes (numbers of over 100 are of interest), and clutter that may include non-target vehicles or other man-made objects. Clutter characterization could potentially contribute to FAR reduction by allowing improved discriminant functions which may depend on a relative comparison of a test image to targets and clutter. On-line clutter characterization could also be used for parameter adaptation or decision confidence adjustments to control FAR. Challenges associated with FAR estimation include large differences between the test imagery and the conditions-of-interest in terms of topology, vegetation coverage, climatic conditions, and development. The target set, the sensor, and their variability must also be considered. Another challenge is to estimate very low FARs with a limited amount of clutter data. Clutter characterization could potentially contribute to FAR estimation by enabling models of the relationship between test images (target and clutter) and the conditions-of-interest. Successful modeling could possibly allow the development of a small ""canonical set"" of test clutter that could be used to predict even small FARs for a given operational scenario.",337,2348,1,No,No,No,,"The Phase I effort should include a thorough statement of the problem, outlines of one or more innovative approaches towards solution, and recommendations of materials and their sources (especially data) that could be used for Phase II.","The Phase II effort should include the exploration of the approach or approaches defined in Phase I, including demonstrations of FAR reductions and estimations in various scenarios.","DUAL USE APPLICATION: The Dual Use potential is limited for this topic; however, clutter characterization methods could possibly benefit air or space surveillance in agricultural or law enforcement applications.",1,"http://www.mbvlab.wpafb.af.mil/public/MBVDATA/.; SAR Public Data Web Site:; The Infrared & Electro-optical Handbook, Vol. 8, Emerging Systems and Technologies, Chapter 4, Automatic Target Recognition Systems, SPIE Optical Engineering Press and Infrared Information Analysis Center.; L.

The effort is broken out into two primary thrusts as described below. A proposer may choose to address one or both of the thrusts without penalty for omission of either thrust. The first challenge, Modeling and Simulation, seeks to expand the frontier of current space-based targeting capabilities by developing and demonstrating new simulation tools which will enable improved evaluation of advanced targeting algorithms. This thrust begins with the development and demonstration of techniques to enhance the fidelity and accuracy of signature data used in modeling and simulation applications. The quality of this data is a key factor for the integrity of algorithmic and evaluation research efforts in this area; improved fidelity and accuracy of signature data may increase confidence in radar tracking and end game engagement assessments. Areas to address include signature data compression techniques, monostatic and bistatic RCS. The proposer shall modify simulation tools as necessary to utilize high-fidelity RCS data and demonstrate the payoff of using enhanced fidelity signature data. These techniques should then be used to support the development of simulation tools which facilitate critical examination of advanced targeting information issues such as fusion of data from multiple platforms and tracking of dim/low observable targets. The emphasis of the simulation phase of this effort would be to formulate appropriate metrics, design and develop simulation tools and use these to examine tradeoffs for potential application. The second challenge, Unified Tracking and classification, seeks to develop robust technologies for simultaneously detecting, tracking and classifying moving targets from measurements of kinematics and signature. We are interested in model-based approaches that offer a unified framework for stochastic estimation of track and clss together, thereby exploiting the natural link that usually exists between them, e.g. through pose-induced transformations in the signature data. Typical kinematic measurements are range and range rate and/or azimuth and elevation, while typical signature measurements include radar high range resolution (HRR) profiles that are pose sensitive. Note that imaging sensors also exhibit signature to kinematic coupling that may be exploitable in a unified estimator. The estimation technology employed should be useful against both air and ground targets (including low observable targets) in multi-target/multi-sensor scenarios. A goal of this thrust is to produce results in real-time using affordable amounts of storage and comutation power. The government will support this thrust with 1) signature data sets, both real and simulated (e.g. the MSTAR collection), and 2) a simulation engine that models aircraft dynamics as well as radar and EO sensor outputs.",429,2992,1,No,No,No,,"In the modeling and simulation area, Phase I effort will include design of new modeling techniques and simulation tools, formulation of evaluation metrics, and implementation of a subset of the modeling and simulation tools that are applicable to single and multi-platform space vehicles.

The following issues should be examined: mix of measurement types; alternatives in phenomena modeling; effects of noise and clutter; algorithm configuration. Final products will include the simulation tool and a technical report documenting the mathematical approach (math formalisms, associated models, computer algorithms), experimental results, performance evaluation, recommendations, and assessment of future directions.","This technology has potential commercial use in search, track and identification systems such as exist in applications like air traffic control and drug interdiction.",1,"S.

The size of the filter is dominated by the size of the inductor. Therefore, one way to reduce overall filter size and weight is to reduce the amount of inductance required, and hence reduce the size of the inductor. In order to do this, the capacitance of the above-mentioned capacitors must increase. The OBJECTIVE of this project is to increase the capacitance of the capacitors in high-Q evanescent-mode filters by an order of magnitude (10X). In the current technology, single-layer thin ceramic substrates are commonly employed for developing capacitance within the very small evanescent-mode filters. Conductors on opposite sides of these thin substrates essentially form a parallel plate capacitor and hence the thickness of the substrate is inversely proportional to the capacitance. Commonly, the ceramic substrate material is alumina or quartz and current substrates are as thin as 0.003"". The capacitors display Q values of at least 1000, or 3 to 4 times that of commercial multilayer capacitors. The capacitance of these devices can be increased by reducing the ceramic substrate thickness. The goal for this effort is to achieve an order of magnitude increase in capacitance, thereby requiring substrates of 0.0003"" thickness. This capacitance is to be achieved at breakdown values consistent with the expected operating voltages. To build such substrates will require fabrication in place, perhaps using techniques such as Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), sputtering or some other evaporative process. Current MOCVD technology can be used to fabricate substrates with a thickness of 0.0001"" but innovative build up layers to 0.0003"" is thought to be possible. The payoff of increasing the capacitance by an order of magnitude would be an order of magnitude reduction in the above-mentioned inductor values and therefore a significant reduction in the size of the filters. A typical intermediate frequency (IF) filter (at approximately 1 GHz) weighs 1 to 3 ounces. The proposed improvement would result in filters weighing only 0.3 to 0.5 ounces. For a typical satellite payload with 500 EF filters, the total filter weight would reduce from 31 - 94 lbs to 9 - 16 lbs.

DESCRIPTION: Electronic signal generation and processing are well established for a wide variety of military radar and radio equipment, covering wide sections of the electromagnetic spectrum. A significant difficulty for signal transmission and reception, however, is transitioning free-space signals of different wavelengths into and out of the electronics. Typically, a different antenna is needed for each different section of the electromagnetic spectrum (VHF, UHF, EHF, Microwave, Optical) to efficiently capture or broadcast signals. This leads to multiple antennas for satellites, command posts, mobile units, and weapon platforms to take advantage of multi-band sensing and communications. On aircraft and unmanned air vehicles, the numerous antennas increase drag and radar returns; both of which detract from mission performance. Proposed research would establish the feasibility of an antenna or aperture whose receiving/transmitting elements can be changed in near-real time to match a variety of operating wavelengths. Payoffs from the technology would include: lower RCS (radar cross-section) military aircraft, vehicles, and command posts; greater wavelength diversity to enhance target detection, increase data transmission, resist jamming/interference, and respond to hostile emanations; reduced logistics base for sensor, communication, intelligence, and avionics apertures.

The requirement for a horizon-to-horizon, full hemispherical coverage of this antenna could be implemented with a large (several meters), single hemispherical conformal phased array antenna. It will provide multiple links to simultaneously support several contact operations ranging from low altitude to geostationary satellites at different directions. This would have the advantages over the conventional multiface planar phased array antenna in improved performance, less number of elements required, wide angle beam steering, efficient scheduling, and resource management.

Research has shown that a variety of ladar (laser radar) modes have the potential to contribute to the long-range NCID solution from both airborne and space platforms. The limited aperture sizes dictated by platform real estate limit the useful range of spatially-resolved imaging and drive the solution to multi-function shared aperture implementations. Non-imaging, high temporal resolution ladar (1D ladar) or range-Doppler ladar (velocity or vibration sensing) promises to provide a viable solution to the long-range NCID requirement utilizing designator-class laser systems. The nature of the 1D-ladar signature is relatively range independent and should have utility well beyond the aperture limited imaging limit. Acceptable research would examine novel extended range ladar concepts and techniques. Proposed transceiver concepts should focus on providing solid-state, eye-safe NCID implementations that maximize multi-function, shared-aperture operation including at least precision range ( 100 mJ/pulse) capabilities. The program may examine, but is not limited to 1D pulse shape and pulse modulation techniques; extended information extraction from 1D returns; range-Doppler techniques; novel transmitter design approaches for both 1D and range Doppler; automatic target recognition; and other promising long-range optical ID concepts.

Imaging in factories for process control, imaging for nondestructive testing, and imaging for surveillance and security are also examples where this technology can be applied.Military and commercial imaging infrared sensors are transitioning from one-dimensional linear arrays to two-dimensional staring arrays. The resolution of staring infrared imaging sensors is limited due to the optics as well as by both the physical dimensions of the detector elements in the focal plane array and the detector pitch. These sensors tend to be inherently under sampled, resulting in aliased imagery. Resolution improvement can be accomplished by reducing the effective detector pitch and increasing the sampling frequency through a technique referred to as dithering, or microscanning. Additional enhancement is possible through deconvolution of the detector and optics blurring. Microscanning involves processing a sequence of frames where the field-of-view of each frame is displaced slightly (typically subpixel) from the other frames to create a high-resolution image.

A common sensor or even common modules, if achievable, would have substantial payoff for the military and commercial markets for ground, air, and space applications. For both functions, multicolor IR has been shown to provide excellent clutter rejection for specific band combinations. The missile threat warning sensor must detect the presence of a threat in a cluttered environment, on short time lines, with a minimum number of false alarms. For this function, the desire to detect missile plumes with minimum background contribution has driven multicolor designs to the Mid-IR spectrum. For multispectral or hyperspectral sensors in surveillance or reconnaissance applications, target detectability is enhanced by exploiting spectral features which have large separation from the highly correlated background for certain spectral combinations. For subpixel target detection, spectral mixing of target and background features must be accounted for. Presently, the optimum bands (and number of bands) for this function is not well understood and is often generalized from specific field scenarios. Initial indications are that LWIR subbands provide more robust discrimination. Increased demand for compact, affordable IR sensors makes the combination of these two, seemingly incompatible functions, highly desirable. Since cost is a major concern, a single sensor either in just the midwave, or one capable of both midwave and long wave subbands would be highly desirable, even if different front end optics had to be used for each application, due to FOR issues.",263,1765,1,No,No,No,,"Investigate spectral properties to enable detection of tactical missiles, theater missiles, and ground targets, to include deep-hide, camouflaged, and concealed targets.

The number of discriminants to be sensed must be traded between target difficulty and host platform volume/cost constraints. Developing federated sensors suitable for the broad range of target tasks and host platforms is financially prohibitive. Recently there has been increased emphasis in developing multi-function EO sensors; for example, sensors which can sample 3-D spatial features via laser radar as well as additional discriminants, such as micro-Doppler for vibration sensing. The need exists for a sensor architecture which can start with a core sensor module and be scaled up, in a modular sense, as the need for additional discriminants is mandated. The core sensor would be designed for a low-cost smart munition, hence, could presumably be a short-range laser radar sensor. A more basic core sensor might be designed for the automotive industry, thus, motivating a very high-volume, low-cost core. As the host changes to manned and unmanned aircraft or space platforms, and the mission mandates additional discriminants, the core sensor would be scaled by additional discriminant modules. Power scaling of a laser source should also be considered. Analogous to the sensor modules, this effort will identify core processing requirements, scalable in a modular sense to accommodate increased discriminant processing.

A more basic module for an automobile proximity and collision warning sensor would be desirable from a cost standpoint, which in turn would be scaled to a munition package.

Candidates to be considered may be active, passive, or a combination and will be collaboratively finalized by the government and small business principal investigators in the early part of Phase I. The intent of Phase I is to determine if modular EO sensors can be realizable and scalable for a large number of missions and platforms; hence, a phenomenological prioritization of discriminants is not required for this topic.

The launch and on orbit position of a satellite could also be determined by a GPS receiver onboard the satellite that can continuously track all-in-view GPS Satellites. The Position information could then be down linked to the ground monitor stations for position determination.

Multispectral discrimination presents an opportunity for significant enhancements in target detectability by exploiting characteristic target spectral (color) features and high background spectral correlation. By extending the spectral information content in this way, the spatial resolution requirements can potentially be relaxed to detect and discriminate target materials which occupy as little as a fraction of a pixel. Results to date under the current program, Brassboard Airborne Multispectral Sensor System Specification (BAMS), have supported this potential of multispectral sensing through extensive spectral measurements and subsequent performance measurements over a range of targets, backgrounds, and environmental conditions. The BAMS program is part of a tri-service research area called the Joint Multispectral Program (JMSP). The performance goals are high probability of detection, low false alarm rates and wide area search capabilities. As part of the BAMS program, multi- and hyperspectral sensor design trades are being refined based on an expanded target/background database. These trades include sensor parameters such as: spectral bands, spectral bandwidths, noise equivalent spectral radiance, band-to-band registration, etc. Currently, the Space-Based Hyperspectral Sensor Technology Initiative was established to provide the warfighter a day/night global surveillance capability to detect and recognize targets and target materials. The initiative capitalizes on the BAMS program by expanding high-altitude airborne reconaissance hyperspectral efforts to mature the technology to the point that demonstration on a space platform is viable. The OBJECTIVE of this SBIR topic is to develop a better understanding of the phenomenology of spectral mixing within a region and to develop sub-pixel detection and classification approaches for an affordable, calibrated, optically-registered multi-band (>100 bands) thermal imaging system using available focal plane arrays.

Current heat exchanger requirements limit the use of high temperature materials and efficient manifold designs. With increased emphasis on aerospace vehicle platform size and range, this problem has become more critical. The emphasis in design is now becoming the development of heat exchangers with decreased weight and volume which operate at much higher temperatures. This will be especially critical for the next generation aerospace vehicles that utilize heat exchangers to transfer heat from exhaust washed and leading edge structures. One solution to this problem is to develop a heat exchanger which functions as both the manifold, or container for the heat exchanger core, and as an integral structural member. In addition to weight and volume reductions, this approach should improve system-level heat management by improving thermal contact with structural elements which are either a heat source (e.g., leading edge) or a heat sink (e.g., outer skin surface). These benefits have the potential to improve aerospace stealth characteristics, dynamic stiffness, and provide greater range or payload capabilities. The heat exchangers will be operating with fluid/surface temperatures in the range of 300-1700 Deg F.

This limitation prevents the accurate determination of temperature increases behind a shockwave due to an explosion in a fluid-filled medium. This effort involves the development of a system that can quantify these rapid temperature changes behind such an explosive shock wave. The system will be used by the Air Force Research Laboratory to describe fully the temperature fluctuations behind a 3 dimensional shock wave in a large (5 ft diameter, approximately 5 ft high) open-top, fluid-filled container with transparent viewports. The shock wave will be generated by a High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) shell detonation near the center of the container. Due to the explosive reactants, detonation of the HEI shell renders the fluid opaque. Because of the envisioned service environment, the system must be very robust. For an in-tank system, probes must be capable of surviving an instantaneous shock wave pressure of approximately 30 ksi, must not be effected by the fluid environment and must be able to use several gauges simultaneously to obtain an accurate description of the 3-D temperature change. For an out-of-tank system, the equipment must be able to work through the thick glass viewports, must be water resistant and must not be affected by the opacity of the fluid behind the shock wave. For all systems, the temperature sensors must have a response time of approximately 1 microsecond and must be resistant to severe electro-magnetic noise. The overall system must be able to record up to 0.1 seconds of data and the temperature reading must be as accurate as possible up to 2000oC.

Standard approaches require substantial mass and power, both of which affect total vehicle size, payload and range. Continued growth in the density of electronics and other items mounted in the vehicles, combined with new operational needs such as reusable space launch systems or hybrid air/space vehicles, and long duration flight of uninhabited air vehicles (UAV), requires the development of new and innovative methods for heat transfer. Total heat loads for long endurance UAVs are expected to be in the 15 to 50 kW range. Internal heat loads for other aircraft, reusable launch systems and satellites will vary widely depending on the type of system and the configuration. Methods to transfer heat from dense sources to the structure or skin of the vehicle, or to thermally isolate equipment from hot structure, need to be simple, dependable, lightweight, and efficient. Reduction or elimination of moving parts is an important goal. Thermal conduction through solids, use of dissimilar metals, and use of ion transport are among the candidate approaches to consider. Coatings and surface treatments will, of course, also have an effect. Avoiding the use of convective fluids can simplify the thermal management equipment and prevent problems in the weightless environment of space.

Monte Carlo methods, for example, typically consume extensive computational resources. This research deals with the rapid generation and execution and statistical post processing of multiple finite element models of structures for purposes of monte carlo simulation of survivability/vulnerability, fatigue and corrosion damage. A number of technology areas require that multiple (a number sufficient for statistical confidence) finite element models of damaged structures be analyzed in the context of a Monte Carlo Simulation. Important cases of this situation which require identical types of analysis include vulnerability analysis of weapon effects on aircraft structures, effects of multi-site fatique damage, residual strength of structures subjected to intergranular corrosion, and large strain deformation of materials and structures incurring internal damage. In these problems a basic structure is repeatedly analyzed subjected to fixed loads in the presence of statistical realizations of a variable load distribution, number of discrete loads and corresponding load application points, a size and number density distribution of ideal geometrical slits, penny shaped cracks or cutouts simulating damage due to a variety of causes such as fragment perforations, fatigue crack populations, or populations of intergranular cracks. In all these cases a parameter (order parameter) associated with the load or damage distributions can reach a critical value at which the structure incurs a complete loss of its strength or stiffness. The order parameter may be product life and the growth of the damage modeled by some stochastic process model such as DLA, Diffusion Limited Aggregation. A finite element model is unable to analyze this state due to the infinitesimal size of the elements required. In the vicinity of this critical value, it is known that the average retained strength or stiffness fits a power law function of the difference of the order parameter from its critical value. Subsequently, performing a Monte Carlo Analysis of the structure in the vicinity of the critical parameter (critical phase transition) will yield results, the average of which must be fitted to a power law curve to infer the critical parameter value as well as the exponent of this variation. The asymptotic behavior near the critical point is known to be independent of the geometry of the damage for example. The Government can realize substantial savings if a single efficient common analysis approach is made available to all these ostensibly separate areas which require performance of the same type of finite element analysis of geometrically modelled damage.

However, none of the profile drag reduction concepts developed have yet been transitioned to aircraft fleet applications, and only the winglet concept of induced drag reduction now appears in the active transport aircraft fleet. A fruitful area for future wing drag research, with a high transition potential, is shock-boundary layer interaction control. Active flow control devices: micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), micro vortex generators and shaped memory alloy (SMA) devices to mention several, have evolved to the point that it is now practical to provide appropriate active aerodynamic control on a wing surface that will reduce the shock- boundary layer interaction drag increment under both cruise and maneuver flight conditions. Furthermore, analytical tools are available that can be used to accurately position the active shock-boundary layer control devices to maximize wing/airfoil L/D performance improvement. The thrust of this project is the development, demonstration and aerodynamic performance validation of an active shock-boundary layer control system(s) that effectively reduces wing drag during cruise (first priority) and maneuver (second priority).",220,1539,1,No,No,No,,Analytically develop an active shock-boundary layer control system(s) designed to improve aircraft wing L/D performance.

The impact of cracks on structural integrity is considered only during the period of crack growth life (i.e., after a crack has initiated.) Therefore, during the life cycle, force-management efforts are applied after accumulated fatigue damage has already manifested as a detectable crack. However, fatigue damage accumulates in service due to cyclic loading. After a lengthy period of incubation, accumulated fatigue damage manifests itself as an incipient fatigue crack, which then grows at a rate proportional to the prevailing service conditions. This period of crack growth is referred to as the crack growth life. The preceding incubation period, in which fatigue damage is accumulating but is not otherwise manifested, is referred to as the crack initiation life. Since the typical crack initiation life period is substantially longer than the crack growth life period, our current force-management approach is constrained by our inability to quantitatively analyze accumulated fatigue damage prior to crack initiation. This topic proposes to develop a concept/technology to identify accumulated fatigue damage prior to crack initiation. Therefore, this proposed concept/technology, by detecting and quantifying accumulated fatigue damage in the crack initiation life period, will allow force-management actions to be employed much sooner and provide the data and understanding that can be employed to extend the life of the pertinent structures well beyond what the current technologies and policies allow.

During the rehost process, this platform dependency often forces the AF/DoD to search out emulation techniques that provide a degree of TPS transferability but add additional maintenance complexity. With the advent of the JAVA based programming language, TPSs can now be written and developed in processor independent ways, elevating the need for translators.

The weight reduction will likely result in airframes that are not as stiff, which will increase the chances of inherent structural dynamic instabilities. One method of improving aeroelastic stability characteristics is to utilize a flutter suppression system. Flutter suppression systems have already been demonstrated at the government laboratories and will undoubtedly be incorporated on future aircraft. An aircraft that utilizes an active flutter suppression system will have dramatically different instability characteristics than a conventional aircraft. Using traditional methods to flight test this type of aircraft will increase risk, and could be completely ineffective. Therefore it is necessary to rethink the way flutter flight testing should be done for aircraft with flutter suppression systems. The conditions that lead to a flutter suppression system being incapable of stabilizing the aircraft need to be identified. New criteria need to be produced to anticipate those conditions before instabilities occur. Visualizations techniques need to be developed so that the flight test engineer can easily identify potential instabilities and take appropriate action.

Because of the importance of the aerodynamics regarding the flying qualities, it is important to determine the accuracy of the predicted aerodynamic model, and devise strategies for correcting it online. During hovering and transition from/to wing borne flight, the dynamics of STOVL aircraft and the corresponding aerodynamic models are highly non-linear, stochastic, and a strong function of height-above-ground and forward speed, which makes the parameter identification a difficult task. Successful application of parameter estimation techniques to this regime needs to be demonstrated. There are several advantages to the AF in improving the accuracy of aerodynamic models from flight tests: 1) Necessary to understand aircraft flying qualities; 2) Necessary when flight control system deficiencies must be corrected; 3) Used to validate contractor prediction methods; 4) Used to reduce flight test risks through more accurate predictions of envelope expansion test points; 5) Necessary to increase the usefulness of the flight test simulator during the test program; 6) Necessary when tests are to be standardized to a selected aircraft configuration and flight condition; and 7) A properly validated model can reduce program risk by allowing more accurate predictions of operational effectiveness and suitability. This technology has direct application to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).

Atom or molecular technology is the science of visualizing, analyzing, controlling, scanning, and applying technologies at the atomic or molecular level. Technologies for identifying chemical categories of observing and measuring molecules or organic polymers on a surface or substrate, or in three-dimensional space using a mechanical probe, electron beam, or laser, (etc.) is the primary objective of this topic. Detection of faulty circuits at this level of surveillance is the primary objective of atom or molecular technology. Atom or molecular technology surveillance in a software controlled stimulus/sensor enviroment is a key issue. If this type of technology can be exploited for test, it could save on repair and equipment costs. Technologies need to be explored which can perceive hardware integrity at the molecular or atomic level. Techniques to perform this type of testing are needed to lower costs and improve fault-detection. Atom technology is of inter- and trans-disciplinary nature, crossing over boundaries of existing technological categories, and constitutes a generic technology common to various industrial fields, such as new materials, electronics, biotechnology and chemistry. An extensive secondary effect may be expected from this important research field.",259,1814,1,No,No,No,,Conduct research and develop procedures for candidate atom or molecular technologies to test and diagnose failures in Air Force hardware.

Engineers develop the circuit model, stimulus patterns and timing sets, then LASAR processes this information into a test routine.

The measurement system to be developed must provide an incremental improvement and a more direct physical measurement relative to the existing non-intrusive technique, the Non-Intrusive Stress Measurements System (NSMS). The NSMS uses a light probe to detect the time-of-arrival of the blade tip and infers tip displacement based upon a model of where the blade tip should be versus where it is. The proposed vibrometer system must be a small (i.e., ~0.5"" diameter threaded sensor nose for engine case mount) and rugged apparatus with no Foreign Object Damage (FOD) potential for the turbine engine or test facility. No intrusion into the gas flow path and nothing that would affect the vibrational characteristics of the components under investigation will be allowed. Adverse environmental considerations include, but are not limited to, window contamination, vibration, and heat. The vibrometer system must detect rigid body motion and dynamic displacement from vibration. Complex engine geometry will require case access view from high incidence angles to completely scan the components of the inner engine stages (width controlled by stator rows between the rotating blade rows). Rotating blade view may be periodically blocked by other components. Penetration of the compressor case for access to the inner stages or other minimal internal component surface preparation may be allowed (i.e., mirrors by polishing). Rapid scanning for transients, to minimize aliasing of high frequency vibrational motion, will be required if a single snap-shot approach is not used. A single snap-shot of the whole blade is the preferred approach. High speed image/data analysis for on-line use is required. Specific system requirements include operating temperature ranges of -60 to 350F (1st stage fan) and up to 2200F (turbine area), 12"" X 6"" maximum blade dimension (1st stage fan), 2"" X 1"" minimum blade dimension (final high pressure compressor (HPC) stage), and rotational rates up to 20,000 RPM. The captured blade view should provide a minimum resolution equivalent to 200x100 Pixels, with the 200 pixel resolution configurable for alignment with the longest dimension of the blade. Potential blade deflection ranges from 0.0005"" (short stiff HPC) to 1.5"" (long, wide fan) with a frequency range of 0 to 30KHz. Blade edges must be well defined such that displacement/modal patterns can easily be overlaid onto a blade outline for the given view.

Current detectors sacrifice resolution, or do only spectral or spatial resolving of radiation output. There is a need to make these measurements simultaneously with a high degree of resolution. The DECADE quad x-ray simulator irradiates a test object with radiation produced by four separate diodes that combine over the entire test area. The effective dose, dose-rate, and spectral hardness of the radiation are thus a combination of those four diode's radiation time histories. An instrument to measure the effective radiation on a test object would be extremely useful. The initial radiation source (MBS) for this measurement would be on the order of a mcal/cm2, a 30-40 nsec pulsewidth, and an area of 100 cm2. The goal is to then scale up to the DECADE radiation source of 20 krad (Si), 40-50 nsec pulsewidth, and 2500 cm2 area. Specifics for such a detector are (1) Spatial Resolution - less than 5 mm (2) Temporal Resolution - less than or equal to 2 nsec (3) Spectral Resolution - 10% energy differentiation (4) Data from the detector would be acquired by 224 channels of modified Analytek digitizers are on site (5) Initial operation area for the detector would be 100 square centimeters (6) Final operation area for the detector would be 2500 square centimeters Development of the detector would include a software package for unfolding spectral and spatial data as well as error analysis of the instrument and a sensitivity matrix of all channels.

This technique has potential application to balance technologies; increased sensitivity in a compact integrated sting/balance structure appears possible. Reference 1 focuses on the use of Bragg gratings and Reference 2 focuses on the use of long period gratings and describes a technique using higher order wave attenuation bands to simultaneously solve for temperature and strain. The Bragg grating has significant temperature sensitivity. The temperature sensitivity of a long period grating can be worse if special design considerations are not incorporated. A technique to produce a doped fiber and attendant calibration methodology that can be used to simultaneously make temperature and strain measurements of sufficient accuracy to be incorporated into a balance and measurement system is needed. The balance system (balance, instrumentation, software, calibration technique) for the Wind Tunnel Application requires a one-piece sting-balance combination where the balance element is circular in cross-section and is an integral extension of the sting. Miniaturization is vital (diameter of less than an eighth of an inch with a working stress of 1/3 yield). Furthermore, accuracy of stress measurement to better than 1% is needed over the temperature range of 40 to 160 degrees f, and temperature resolution and accuracy better than 1 degree and 2 degrees f, respectively, is needed. The measurement system for Engine Test Application, that will permit measurement of stress and temperature of turbine engine components during operation, requires the ability to measure stress and temperature with accuracy of better than 1%. These measurements will be made over a temperature range of 400 to 2300 degrees F. The limitations of utilizing doped fibers may preclude the application of fibers with doped gratings to this range of temperatures. In this event, other fiber-optics applications will be considered.

In order to apply the theoretical advantages of M&S, model updating is required. Modern nonlinear parameter and systems identification programs do not work well with conventional total force and moment coefficient, table lookup aerodynamic models. These models are used in simulations due to their computational simplicity and ability to use linear interpolation and extrapolation. Unfortunately, these models are difficult to directly update based on flight test results. Modern nonlinear parameter identification(ID) methods work well with polynomial equations used for describing the forces and moments. Unfortunately, these models do not necessarily work well in simulation. A methodology which uses a hybrid of the two above techniques has shown promise for both use in simulation, and nonlinear parameter ID methodologies, this is the 'spline model' technique. The nonlinear forces and moments are described as a series of polynomials over a range of independent variables. Another promising technique is using multivariable orthogonal functions to describe analytic representations of the nonlinear aerodynamics. Current and most future aerodynamic simulation models are, and will be, of the old total coefficient table lookup type. Modifying these models to a form suitable for nonlinear PID from flight test data is time consuming and expensive.

The primary reason for using arrays is to produce a directive beam that can be repositioned (scanned) electronically. Phased array antennas allow precise beam patterning. They are complicated assemblies of radiating and receiving elements, phase shift networks, control electronics and a powerful computer that computes the required phase shift and time delay, if needed, at each element. This information is passed to individual or group decoders which drive the phase shifter and time delay units. The computer has knowledge of the physical topology of the phased array elements and the available phase shifts and time delays. The frequency of interest is also known. The steering commands are in terms of phase shift and time delays but the actual computation depends solely on time differences. Thus the phase shift is actually a function of the frequency of interest. All of this is currently accommodated by the out-of-date beam steering computer. These functions could be accomplished in a highly cost/weight effective manner through the application of a high density single chip computer, phase shift driver, and time delay driver, that is small, modular and flexible.

The mission is accomplished by a fleet of several smaller microsatellites, rather than launching a single large spacecraft, with the payload distributed among the micro-craft to reduce the mission risk. Loss of one microspacecraft would not eliminate the entire operation. Furthermore, launch costs may be reduced significantly as a result of substantially reduced spacecraft masses. The traditional approach in designing satellites is to structurally stiffen the satellite so that it will survive during the launch environments; once on-orbit, the satellite structure mass is no longer needed. This approach is a very inefficient way to design satellites, considering the fact that a kg of mass costs tens of thousands of dollars to put into space. Therefore, it is necessary to devise different ways to structurally stiffen the satellite.

Displays often control information acquisition, which impacts the speed and effectiveness of decision making, and they are essential for situational awareness and control of the battle space. The dominant display technologies currently are cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs). However, CRTs require vacuum and cannot practically be built to large scale because of their weight and bulk. LCDs employ a complex and expensive fabrication process to produce high resolution, require backlighting, and have a limited viewing angle. Conventional electroluminescent (EL) display is the only technology used in flat panels, which is totally solid-state and free of a vacuum enclosure. It is intrinsically rugged, has a wide operating temperature range, has no viewing angle problems, and is very bright. However, multi-color performance is poor, and it requires a high voltage (~100 volts) for excitation/addressing, which adds to its cost and makes it unsuitable for numerous applications. Quantum-dot EL displays have the advantages of a conventional EL display while overcoming the problems that have limited the widespread application of conventional EL devices. A quantum-dot display will achieve multicolor emission from the same material by employing quantum dots (as emissive elements) of varying diameters (where ""size =color"").

Data links at 1 Terabit per second (one million Megabits) over optical fiber, at one error bit per billion, have also been achieved. Fiber rates of 10-40 Gigabits/sec are becoming commercially available, as are new local area networks (LANs) delivering a Gigabit per second or more (the 1 GB Ethernet). Future high-speed global internetworking for the Military should effectively utilize these ultra-fast media whenever possible to deliver Ultra-High-Speed communications with high reliability. Ultra-High-Speed links are needed to support the multiplexing of many different users connected to the Global Internetwork via a variety of physical media links transmitting and receiving multimedia data. Single users constitute a large part of the (RF link) Global Internetwork; and current reliable wireless transmission rates are on the order of several Megabits/sec as proposed for third generation commercial cellular systems. This rate needs to be sustainable for military use over a Wide-Area Network that utilizes a diversity of links: co-axial cable, fiber, and laser channels. To achieve this Global Intemetworking conception, concentrated effort is required in several specific areas. The use of parallel optical computing systems to exploit temporal-to-spatial waveform conversion ('twavelength division multiplexing"") holds great promise for both encryption and achieving faster rates. Space-time coding can be very effective in facilitating reliable reception rates in wireless ""fading"" environments, and for alleviating multi-path effects. Joint ""semi-blind"" equalization and interference cancellation, relying on short training sequences and ingenious use of antenna arrays, is a promising innovation. Attention must be paid not only to ""physical layer"" optimization but also to the incorporation of link layer models to achieve needed rates over power and band-limited channels. As analog-to-digital converters operating at 1 GHz or higher become commercially available, new real-time signal processing schemes are required in Software Radio and should be phased into military platforms. Space assets will be the backbone of the 3rd Millenium Global Network. Issues in channel allocation and control, hand-offs, LEO-to-GEO transmission/reception, and power amplifier linearization must be resolved before full exploitation of Space can be achieved. Multi-rate, multiple-access transmission policies must be investigated further, with emphasis on CDMA, TDMA and multicarrier hybrid policies. A critical issue is robust implementation of the (Wireless) CDMA to (Global Network) ATM link.

Algorithm/software concepts of interest include (1) guidance software, including guidance laws, estimators, autopilots, and AJGPS software, (2) innovative signal and image processing algorithms for use within autonomous target acquisition (ATA) applications, and (3) operations/functions associated with the ATA process involving noise elimination, detection, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and identification. Algorithms capable of processing/fusing multi-sensor data are of interest. Fundamentally new approaches to closed-loop autonomous guidance based on biomimetic principles are of particular interest. Commercial dual use applications for these include sensors, processors algorithms applicable to medical imaging, commercial aviation (adverse weather penetration), remote sensing and surveillance. c. The Ordnance Division is seeking new and innovative ideas/concepts to support the development of advanced warheads, fuzes, and explosives for use in air-delivered conventional munitions to defeat ground, mobile, air targets, as well as above-ground and buried structures. Technologies developed should ultimately result in new and innovative components which are needed to meet the complex future munitions requirements for general-purpose bombs, penetrating warheads, submunitions, safe-arm-fire devices, explosive detonators, explosives and advanced energetic materials, and devices for collecting data to be used in warhead design and analysis. Technologies for defeating weapons of mass destruction, including biological and chemical agents, and/or access denial to stored weapons, are of interest. Dual use application for these technologies include facility/plant security and monitoring, high speed wireless data transmission, micro-electrical mechanical devices for controls and collision avoidance, high powered energy storage devices (capacitors and batteries) and environmentally responsible recycling of energetics and other materials.",537,4315,1,No,No,No,,Determine the technological or scientific merit and the feasibility of the innovative concept.,Produce a well-defined deliverable product or process.,Each proposal submitted under this general topic should have an associated dual-use commercial application of the planned technology.

These methodologies should be modular, highly efficient, and incorporate key physics of the aerostructure interaction environment.","The Air Force has launched an aggressive, three-phase program to improve all aspects of design and performance of fixed wing vehicles. Phase I goals in this program include, but are not limited to: a 25% increase in mission range, a 10% reduction in take-off gross weight, a 5% increase in aircraft lethality, and a 10% reduction in acquisition costs. Achieving these goals will require radical departures from current design practices and include: eliminating wind tunnel flutter models, robust identification of critical flight loads, and integration of aerodynamics, structures, and flight controls in initial design synthesis. Technical challenges are numerous and include: orders of magnitude reduction in computational time, highly improved accuracy in flutter speed prediction, modeling of complex geometries with and without external stores, better accuracy in buffet/vibroacoustic response, and better accuracy in predicting flight loads. Several fundamental aspects of aerodynamics and structures must be better understood before these technical challenges can be overcome. First and foremost, a dramatic improvement in our understanding of aerodynamic nonlinearities in the presence of flexible structures must be achieved, particularity as it relates to the transonic flight regime. Second, structural nonlinearites and their effects on such phenomena as limit cycle oscillation must be thoroughly investigated, understood, and characterized.

We are interested in exploring innovative technology domains with clear prospective or realized commercial value and their application to DAF operations (i.e. dual-purpose technologies or solutions). We recognize that it is impossible for the STTR program to specifically solicit every potentially relevant technological area, thus this topic is intended to be an open call for specific ideas and technologies to include concepts or technologies that are not be currently solicited (i.e. the “unknown-unknown”). It is important that any potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with the technological change and thus should be closely tied to prospective commercial offerings that will help support the development of the solution for a DAF application. This topic is meant to facilitate development of solutions to meet DoD stakeholders’ needs in a short timeframe and at low cost. Solutions for this topic should be focused on the three areas listed below and should try to satisfy the criteria below to the maximum extent possible. Commercialization Potential – The offeror(s) should demonstrate broad commercialization potential for the prospective solution in both the Defense and commercial markets. The most effective solutions demonstrate this potential through clear and concise description of customer value or Return on Investment over the current alternative. Moreover, the best solutions are expected to generate varied interest of non-affiliated commercial, investment, and defense entities – financial or otherwise. Relevance to the Defense market – The offeror(s) should demonstrate an understanding of the relevance of their solution to their prospective customers and end-users in the Defense market. The offeror(s) may provide an indication of a defense ‘need’ by demonstrating knowledge of the current status of the solution’s prospective operational environment and stakeholders as well as preliminary discussions with those stakeholders. In addition, the offeror(s) may demonstrate relevance to published Focus Areas or other given stakeholders. Technical/Team – The proposed approach’s technical merit, as indicated by supporting, peer-reviewed advocacy (including but not limited to scientific articles or publications), depth and relevance of team member experience, and other demonstrations of relevant and varied interest as well as other means support of the relevant intellectual property. In summary - proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of quickly identifying and realizing product-market fit between an end user and the proposed solution. BROAD FOCUS AREAS FOR AFX20D-TCSO1 OPEN TOPIC Though the topic is truly ‘Open’ (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), we have identified known areas of interest for which potential DAF Customers and/or funding have already been identified. These areas, which are designed to facilitate streamlined customer discovery, are broken out into broad ‘Focus Areas’, are described below. For this specific solicitation, the sole Focus Area supports the Agility Prime initiative: FOCUS AREA 1: Orb/eVTOL/UAM (Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing/Urban Air Mobility): The objective of this Focus Area is to explore potential commercial products being developed in the emerging eVTOL/UAM market for potential disaster response, humanitarian aid, and logistics missions. This sub-topic is intended survey a large scope of technologies to include: autonomy; advanced aircraft materials and manufacturing; novel acoustics techniques; subsystem, aircraft, and portfolio design and analysis tools; rapid mission planning for dense air environments and logistics efficiencies; command and control of air vehicles; robotic landing gear; large flotation devices; modular payload designs; air vehicle data networks and RF waveforms; sense and avoid architectures, algorithms, and sensors; electrical power storage, generation, charging; distributed electric propulsion control techniques. The alignment between a proposal and a ‘Focus Area’ can strengthen or compliment a proposal’s merits, but does not singularly fulfill the requirement to demonstrate the defense need as listed above. To be clear, the concept of ‘Focus Areas’ is not intended to discourage companies offering solutions not immediately applicable to current DAF interest areas, but are simply a mechanism by which current DAF interests are published to the broader small business industry base.",660,4612,1,No,No,No,,"Validate the product-market fit between the proposed solution and a potential USAF stakeholder and conducting a feasibility study by defining a clear and immediately actionable plan for demonstrating value and mitigating risk with the proposed solution and the proposed DAF customer. This feasibility study should: 1. Clearly identify the prime potential DAF end user(s) and AF customer/transition agent (note: the user and customer will likely be two different people) and articulate how they would implement your solution(s) (i.e., the one who is most likely to an early adopter, first user, and initial transition partner). 2. Deeply explore the problem or benefit area(s) which are to be addressed by the solution(s) - specifically focusing on how this solution will impact the end user of the solution, especially in light of current alternatives. 3. Define clear and measureable objectives and key results for a potential trial of the proposed solution with the identified AF end user(s). 4. Clearly identify any additional specific stakeholders beyond the AF end user(s) who will be critical to the success of any potential trial. This includes, but is not limited to, program, contracting, or finance organizations as well as relevant certifying or validating entities 5. Describe how the solution would differ from the non-defense commercial offering (i.e. how would it be modified as compared to its commercial counterpart). 6. Describe the cost and feasibility of integration with current mission-specific products. 7. Describe if and how the demonstration can be used by other DoD or governmental customers. The funds obligated on the resulting Phase I STTR contracts are to be used for the sole purpose of conducting a thorough feasibility study. Prototypes may be developed with STTR funds during Phase I studies to better address the risks and potential payoffs in innovative technologies.","Develop, install, integrate or otherwise demonstrate a prototype system determined to be the most feasible solution during the Phase I feasibility study. This demonstration should focus specifically on: 1. Evaluating the proposed solution against the objectives and measurable key results as defined in the Phase I feasibility study. 2. Describing in detail how the solution differs from prospective non-defense commercial offerings in comparison to DAF counterparts and how it can be scaled for broader use. 3. A clear transition path for the proposed solution that takes into account input from all affected stakeholders, including but not limited to: end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security. 4. Specific details about how the solution can integrate with other current and potential future solutions. 5. How the solution can be sustainable (i.e. overall supportability) 6. Clearly identify other specific DoD or governmental customers who want to use the solution","This is the main goal of this topic: we expect that some solutions may go directly from Phase I to Phase III upon verification of product-market fit. The contractor will transition the solution to provide expanded mission capability to a broad range of potential government and civilian users and alternate mission applications. NOTES: a.

A: 

Q2 (09/11/2023): The topic description mentions ITAR restrictions and the units providing tentative determinations regarding applicability. It is unclear how should we approach this requirement:

<ol>
	<li>If our technology doesn&rsquo;t fall under one of the covered fields, should we provide a declaration to this effect?</li>
	<li>If our technology is covered, should we file in a DD 2345? Are there additional actions to perform?</li>
</ol>
A: 

Q3 (09/10/2023): Are SBIR CSO X23.7 and STTR CSO X23E considered 2 different open topics?&nbsp; Can we - as a single company - apply to both with a different technology solution?
A: 

Q4 (09/08/2023): <p class=""x"">Is it permissible to resubmit a Selected/Not Funded proposal under solicitation X23.7 and X23.8?
A: Yes. These are distinct solicitations from previous solicitations so previous proposal submission does not aid or prejudice a proposal in getting selected in a later round.

Q5 (09/08/2023): <p class=""xx"">A team of ours is set on including a video link within their Tech Volume submission slides for the 23.7/E Phase One Open topic. Can we get a clarification over whether these will/can be seen by AFWERX reviewers? Or if we should not have links like this within a proposal?
A: <p class=""x"">Solicitation Section 4(b)(xviii) entitled &ldquo;Promotional Materials&rdquo; prohibits the Government from evaluating such information.

Q6 (09/05/2023): The RFP above specifies that Phase I efforts have a maximum budget of $110,000, however in the submission portal when a proposal record is created for this topic is is saying there is a $75,000 budget limit. Can you clarify which information is correct?

&nbsp;

If it is the former, should proposers simply override the $75,000 limit the portal and ignore the errors it generates?
A: The maximum funding amount on this topic is $75,000.00.

Q7 (09/01/2023): Ground Effect vehicle for traversing mine fields and spraying crops or winter rescue &amp; rescuing wounded from across land mines I need to know how you evaluate your need, i.e. transport 1 liter or 6 like SOCOM once wanted for a side-by-side UTV.&nbsp; I can&#39;t bid a full proposal without knowing your intended purposes (scope).&nbsp;

Q1) Range? speed/ noise? environmental conditions, temp. limits/wind speeds? payload carry capacities?&nbsp; Does it have to fit on a 463L pallet or in an ISO container or just a truck?&nbsp;

Q2) What cargo area length? carry wounded/fuel/renewable&nbsp;power generation/ sustainment needs/ weapons/RPGs/Bangalore lane breachers etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Q3) What intended obstacles is it intended to breach or traverse? water/fences/11 row concertina anti-vehicle obstacles etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Q4) autonomy? We are trying to please the broadest scope of end users; We could build our quieter, multi-fuel engine but it would cost substantially more.
A: All proposals are evaluated in accordance with the Evaluation Criteria located on page 40 of the solicitation. The topic is technology-agnostic so information about specific technology areas is not available.

Q8 (08/31/2023): We see two DAF Phase 1 Open Topics that look identical except for the topic number a bit of formatting:

&nbsp; &nbsp; AFX237-PCSO1 and&nbsp;AFX23E-TPCSO1

Is there a difference and how do we decide which is appropriate for us?&nbsp; Thank you.
A: Both topics are Open Topics. AFX237-PCSO1 is a SBIR offering, while AFX23E-TPCSO1 is an STTR offering. The minimum Performance of Work requirements differ between the two programs, as STTR requires a partnering Research Institution to be proposed. The topics themselves are identical.

Q9 (08/31/2023): Is a signed MOU required as part of a valid Phase 1 proposal?&nbsp; Specifically, is the MOU a requirement, or just good to have, for the Phase 1?
A: No. There is no Customer Memorandum requirement for Phase I, but please see Evaluation Criteria 1 for a discussion about the function of an MOU were one to be submitted.

Q10 (08/30/2023): Is there a limit as to the number of Phase I open topic ideas that can be submitted&nbsp;at one time? For example, if I have 5 separate of solutions that are totally different pieces of technology that I think could benefit the Air Force, could I submit 5 separate Phase I open call&nbsp;proposals in Sept of 2023?
A: A small business concern may only submit one (1) proposal to each open topic. If more than one proposal from a small business concern is received for a single open topic, only the most recent proposal to be certified and submitted prior to the submission deadline will receive an evaluation. All prior proposals submitted by the small business concern for the same open topic will be marked as noncompliant.",,,1,,Advanced Computing and Software | Advanced Materials | Biotechnology | Directed Energy | Human-Machine Interfaces | Hypersonics | Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems | Integrated Sensing and Cyber | Microelectronics | Quantum Science | Renewable Energy Generation and Storage | Space Technology | Trusted AI and Autonomy,Advanced Computing and Software | Advanced Materials | Biotechnology | Directed Energy | Human-Machine Interfaces | Hypersonics | Integrated Network Systems-of-Systems | Integrated Sensing and Cyber | Microelectronics | Quantum Science | Renewable Energy Generation and Storage | Space Technology | Trusted AI and Autonomy,13,<p>Open; Other; Disruptive; Radical; Dual-Use; Commercial</p>,6,<p>Open,No,0,No,,"This is a Department of the Air Force (DAF) Open Topic in partnership with AFWERX and SpaceWERX.

This rapid acquisition effort will use both commercial and government mission partners, such as commercial satellite providers and government-contracted launch services, during a conflict or a crisis to respond to threats or augment existing capabilities. Our mission is to reduce USSF response times from months or weeks to days or hours, having a significant impact on U.S. and ally resilience. Developing TacRS capabilities requires an all-encompassing approach - it requires coordinated processes, planning, and technical means to respond on operationally relevant timelines. This includes proven spacecraft bus and payloads that can be quickly integrated with minimal non-recurring engineering, an efficient means to get to the necessary orbit, a scalable and accredited ground software/network, trained mission operators, and on-orbit operational procedures to include end-of-life disposal. To respond quickly, all mission segments to include launch must be integrated to produce a timely operational effect. To execute a TacRS mission, this notionally includes processing strategies, logistics, space payload sensor integration, space vehicles, launch vehicles, and integrated ground systems to form the capability to rapidly respond to on-orbit needs. The USSF encourages participants in this Challenge to offer technological solutions for experimentation and/or feasibility study, as well as developed solutions. The DAF is interested in understanding all underlying technologies upon which the solution relies. CONTEXT As evidenced by the investments and numerous deployments of capabilities placed on orbit by near-peers, Space is a dynamic domain. During a conflict, these space capabilities may interfere with or destroy U.S. space assets. Therefore, the USSF is interested in net-new solutions, enhancements to existing materiel and non-materiel solutions, and/or the development of multi-capable solutions. In preparation for future conflicts against technologically advanced competitors, the USSF will need normalized processes and demonstrated capabilities to respond to emerging threats within the space warfighting domain. &ldquo;In order to be ready to respond when called upon, we are seeking ideas and solutions to continue advancing TacRS. We need to build off of established TacRS processes and acquisition practices to explore how we make dedicated responsive launch, rapid manifesting, and prepositioning of space vehicles on orbit all regular TacRS practices,&rdquo; said Lt Col MacKenzie Birchenough, Materiel Leader for Space Safari, Space Systems Command. &ldquo;Successfully moving TacRS from demonstrations to an enduring capability will be achieved by leveraging the best practices and ideas from industry, academia, and government.&rdquo; Within each area of emphasis defined below, the USSF has identified a set of potential desired capabilities.

Is it limited to just one?
A: Only one Customer Memorandum may&nbsp;be utilized&nbsp;to support the proposal.&nbsp; Any additional end-user support may be provided in the form of a Letter of Support along with the proposal.

Q2 (10/29/2023): It would be helpful to clarifiy and elaborate on the requirements for &quot;Solutions with a Clear DAF Stakeholder Need:&quot;

We have a commercial product that, with a Phase II-scale project, can be modified/upgraded to uniquely address **R&amp;D** needs of interest to the DAF, and have engaged with a potential customer: a university researcher with strong ONR/AFOSR funding in hypersonics. The proposed work is consistent with the &quot;capability to prototype validated concepts under an accelerated Phase II schedule&quot; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... applied research and development efforts rather than &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; or basic Research (R)/Research &amp; Development(R&amp;D)&quot; but is definitely NOT something that would see field deployment any time in the near future.

Is such a project consistent with the CSO solicitation?
A: Section 1. a. Objectives provides clarification and elaboration on the requirement for &quot;Solutions with a Clear DAF Stakeholder Need&quot; with the following information:

The DAF SBIR Program&rsquo;s objectives include stimulating technological innovation, strengthening the small business role in meeting DoD research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E) needs, fostering and encouraging minority and disadvantaged persons-owned small businesses in technological innovation, and increasing commercial application of DoD-supported RDT&amp;E results. The DAF has identified 6 Strategic Capabilities: Air Superiority; Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Rapid Global Strike; Command and Control; Responsibilities to organize, train, and equip Airmen; Air Force *Blue Sky. The United States Space Force has identified six Strategic Capabilities: Space Security; Combat Power Projection; Space Mobility and Logistics; Information Mobility; Space Domain Awareness; Responsibilities to organize, train, and equip Guardians; Space Force *Blue Sky. *Additionally, it is possible for a solution to provide a strategic capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if an applicant feels its solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, it can reference the &ldquo;BLUE SKY&rdquo; category, including an explanation of the solution&rsquo;s ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of Air Force, Space Force, national, and global constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.

Additionally, reference the &#39;Technical Evaluation Criteria&#39; and&nbsp;Table 5: Technical Volume Content Description (Volume 2) for additional information regarding your question.

Q3 (10/27/2023): My company PARADIGM EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGIES INC. decarbonizes diesel engine emissions using a plasma reactor.&nbsp; Diesel fleets reduce CO2 and save money on maintenance and fuel.&nbsp; Paradigm received a SBIR Phase I award by the National Science Foundation in 2022.&nbsp; We completed the NSF funded SBIR Phase I project and we would&nbsp;now like to submit a SBIR Phase II proposal to the&nbsp;AFX244-DPCSO1 solicitation for funding to commercialize the technology.&nbsp; Is plasma reactor technology that decarbonizes diesel emissions a topic of interest for this solicitation?&nbsp; Thank you for considering our question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Q4 (10/26/2023): Will you provide a Teaming List for subcontractors who want to be part of this CSO? These subcontractors may have a piece that a contractor is missing and can add their expertise.&nbsp;
A: The Air Force is not able to provide this information at this time.

Q5 (10/25/2023): Will the Air Force consider a Canadian Company as a sub-contractor on this topic?&nbsp; Solution would use&nbsp;Extended Reality for mission command.
A: For both Phase I and Phase II, the R/R&amp;D work must be performed in the United States. However, based on a <strong>rare and unique circumstance</strong>, agencies may approve a particular portion of the R/R&amp;D work to be performed or obtained in a country outside of the United States, for example, if a supply or material or other item or project requirement is not available in the United States.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract or an Other Transaction for any purpose, to include a prototype, under this CSO. This program solicitation is intended for informational purposes and reflects current planning. If there is any inconsistency between the information contained herein and the terms of any resulting SBIR/STTR Funding Agreement, the terms of the Funding Agreement are controlling.The United States Department of the Air Force has identified 7 Operational Imperatives: Space Order ofBattle; Operationally Focused Air Battle Management Systems (ABMS); Moving Target Engagement;Tactical Air Dominance; Resilient Basing; Global Strike; Readiness to Deploy and Fight. TheseOperational Imperatives are the critical operational capabilities and functions the Department of the AirForce must invest in to protect the United States' ability to deter conflict and project power against pacingchallenges.NOTE: The possibility exists for a solution to provide a strategic capability in an area other than theabove-referenced Operational Imperatives. Therefore, if the applicant believes the proposed solution doesnot fit within one of the listed Operational Imperatives, reference ""BLUE SKY"", including an explanationof the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of AF, national, andglobal constraints. As applicable, the applicant should address the category(ies) to which the solution aligns in the Technical Volume.Department of the Air Force Operational Imperatives: https://www.af.mil/Portals/1/documents/2023SAF/OPERATIONAL_IMPARITIVES_INFOGRAPHIC.pdf Multiple procurements are planned and anticipated to be awarded as a result of the topic, each proposal is considered a separate procurement and will be evaluated on its own merit, and the Government may award all, some, or none of the proposals. Any per-award or per-topic funding caps are budgetary estimates only, and more or less funding may become available. Funding decisions are made with complete disregard to the other awards under the same topic. The DAF reserves the right to award to all proposals it receives, some of the proposals it receives, or none of the proposals it receives. The Federal Government is not responsible for any monies expended by the applicant before award. The SBIR/STTR Programs are not substitutes for existing unsolicited proposal mechanisms. Unsolicited proposals are not accepted under the AF SBIR/STTR Programs for Phases I or II. This solicitation is not an offer by the federal Government and does not obligate the Government to make any specific number of awards. Awards under the SBIR/STTR program are contingent upon the availability of funds.","f. Topic Description The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, they should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders' needs. Submissions should focus on the following characteristics: The potential for Government or private sector commercialization and benefits expected to accrue from commercialization. The SBC's record of commercializing SBIR/STTR or other research, as indicated by pre-sales, pilots, sales, revenue, active users, subscriptions, downloads, and/or other forms of traction/adoption. The size of the market and potential for revenue. The clarity of the SBC's business plan. The Existence of Phase II follow-on commitments for the subject research, and funding commitments related to the subject effort, whether from Government sources, as documented in a DAF Customer Memorandum, or private sources, as documented through a letter of commitment, are evidence of commercialization potential. The Defense Need being fulfilled and ability of the proposal to impact that Defense Need. The appropriateness, relevance, and specificity of an identified Defense Need. While not required, signed letters of support from other Government personnel may be indicators of the appropriateness, relevance, and specificity of an identified Defense Need. Adequacy of the proposed effort and its relationship to fulfilling the identified Defense Need. The level of defense mission impact and urgency of the Defense Need. The breadth of applicability of the solution. The clarity of the problem statement, technical approach, soundness, technical merit, and innovation of the proposed technical approach, its differentiation from current customer alternatives. Includes the proposed Principal Investigator's/Project Managers', supporting staff, and consultants' qualifications to execute the proposed approach.This topic is truly &lsquo;open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for the topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-market fit between an Air Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.",346,2475,1,No,No,No,,"Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas thought to have potential to transition to Air Force applications. Additionally, validate the product-market fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the Air Force customer and end-user. This feasibility study should: Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Air Force need(s). Describe the pathway to integrating the Air Force operations, to include how the applicant plans to accomplish core technology development, navigate applicable regulatory processes, and integrate with other relevant Air Force systems and/or processes.Describe if and how the solution can be used by other DoD or Government customers.","Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system. These activities should focus specifically on: Evaluating the adapted solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results. Describing in detail how the installed solution differs from the non-defense commercial offering to solve the Air Force need(s), as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale. Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security. Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions. 5. Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or Governmental customers for the solution",Some solutions may go straight from Phase I to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. The contractor will transition the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential Governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.,1,"FitzGerald, B., Sander, A., & Parziale, J.

Topic Description The DAF is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions, a vast majority of which have similar counterparts in the commercial sector. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, they should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the proposed development. This topic is meant for non-defense commercial solutions to be adapted to meet Air Force stakeholders' needs. Submissions should focus on the following characteristics: The potential for Government or private sector commercialization and benefits expected to accrue from commercialization. The SBC's record of commercializing SBIR/STTR or other research, as indicated by pre-sales, pilots, sales, revenue, active users, subscriptions, downloads, and/or other forms of traction/adoption. The size of the market and potential for revenue. The clarity of the SBC's business plan. The Existence of Phase II follow-on commitments for the subject research, and funding commitments related to the subject effort, whether from Government sources, as documented in a DAF Customer Memorandum, or private sources, as documented through a letter of commitment, are evidence of commercialization potential. The Defense Need being fulfilled and ability of the proposal to impact that Defense Need. The appropriateness, relevance, and specificity of an identified Defense Need. While not required, signed letters of support from other Government personnel may be indicators of the appropriateness, relevance, and specificity of an identified Defense Need. Adequacy of the proposed effort and its relationship to fulfilling the identified Defense Need. The level of defense mission impact and urgency of the Defense Need. The breadth of applicability of the solution. The clarity of the problem statement, technical approach, soundness, technical merit, and innovation of the proposed technical approach, its differentiation from current customer alternatives. Includes the proposed Principal Investigator's/Project Managers', supporting staff, and consultants' qualifications to execute the proposed approach.This topic is truly &lsquo;open' (agnostic of industry, technology, and problem area), but proposals for the topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-market fit between an Air Force stakeholder and the proposed adaptation of the non-defense commercial solution.",346,2475,1,No,No,No,,"Determine, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas thought to have potential to transition to Air Force applications. Additionally, validate the product-market fit between the proposed solution and a potential Air Force stakeholder. Define a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the Air Force customer and end-user. This feasibility study should: Clearly identify the potential stakeholders of the adapted solution for solving the Air Force need(s).

I read the Topic objective as a platform-agnostic payload design, and the cost target as less than $10K per payload. &nbsp;Yet your answer states less than $10K per small UAS. Are you looking for a UAS solution with EW capability? Or a payload solution that can be employed and scaled for various unmanned platforms in the Group 1-3 category? Thanks for clarifying.&nbsp;
A: I can see where the question on 6/3 and the answer is confusing. &nbsp;To me, the main point of the question was to clarify $10k for three (3) “systems” or one (1) “system”. &nbsp;The answer is clearly for one (1) system. &nbsp;The confusion surrounds the word “system”. &nbsp;The system in this case is the payload. &nbsp;I should have answered “$10k for each sUAS <i><u>payload</u></i>”. This topic focuses on Low-Cost EW Payloads and I assumed everyone was thinking payload. &nbsp;However, cost saving measures for an entire payload and sUAS are welcome.

Q2 (06/04/2025): <ol><li>The solicitation calls out “Develop and demonstrate a system that meets a price target of $10K or below”. yet the description before this point is about EW payload development. Is the $10K price point per EW payload system, or is it for the complete system including sUAS, controller, and communications system?<br>&nbsp;</li><li>If the $10K/system includes the sUAS platform, isn’t this inconsistent with the platform agnostic requirement?</li><li>With respect to the platform agnostic requirement, does the payload need to adhere to open standards such as the Modular Payload Standard (MPS) or IEEE1937.1 payload interface and performance standard?</li><li>Does the payload need to provide its own power or can it obtain power from the sUAS?</li><li>How long (time) is the Payload to remain operational?</li><li>What is the operational range for the EW payload?</li><li>What is the operational time/range for the sUAS?</li><li>Phase II is calling out “mesh-type networking and necessary resource management”. This is payload separate from the one designed in Phase I, correct?</li><li>This system is to be designed to be attritible air effect, correct?</li><li>The description calls out, “…&nbsp;various payloads to deliver a broad range of EW effects (e.g., geolocation, jamming, spoofing, etc.).” So is the goal a single multipurpose payload programmable for different mission profiles or multiple single purpose payloads?</li></ol>
A: Answers:<ol><li>The $10k price is per EW payload. &nbsp;Not the complete sUAS.</li><li>See answer for #1.</li><li>We’re open to a wide range of concepts. &nbsp;There is no correct or incorrect assumption on interface standards. &nbsp;Feel free to propose whatever you think best fits the topic description and document your assumptions.</li><li>The topic suggests a new system, so you can choose either way. If you choose to obtain power from the sUAS, please research the various “typical” prime power available on the various group 3 and below sUAS platforms. &nbsp;It will vary depending on size. &nbsp;Please document your assumptions.</li><li>The topic description is written in such a way as to not put limitations or minimums on the operational range and operational time of the payload or sUAS platform. &nbsp;The emphasis is on allowing for innovative designs for low-cost payloads. &nbsp;Please document your use cases and assumptions. &nbsp;I understand the need for scoping, so I'll offer the following thoughts: &nbsp;The topic states “These payloads can provide rapid, cost-effective solutions for EW operations by utilizing off-the-shelf components and open-source software, drastically reducing the timeline and cost of development.” &nbsp;This is stating the potential cost benefits and development benefits of off-the-shelf components and open-source software, which is of prime concern for the topic. &nbsp;The statement is not limiting you and your design/concept. &nbsp;We’re open to a wide range of ideas. &nbsp;Please document your approach (whether that is using existing systems/architectures or new/modified). &nbsp; &nbsp;Also, the topic objective states “…EW effects on target, en masse.”. &nbsp;Decomposition path of en masse requirement allows for “swarming” in which not every member of the swarm must be identical. &nbsp;This would also imply there must be a communication system between the units. &nbsp;And finally, the topic description is written in such a way to allow for a wide range of RF bands, threats, and concepts. &nbsp;There are no specific frequencies of interest currently. &nbsp;Please keep in mind the description does state “non-tailored EW effects”, which generally refers to area denial and broad application. Finally, there is no specific end user in mind and there is no specific program of record identified for transition. &nbsp;However, special operations forces would greatly benefit from this technology and this could drive scoping of range and time.</li><li>&nbsp;See answer in #5.</li><li>&nbsp;See answer in #5.</li><li>No, not correct. &nbsp;The same payload. &nbsp;The desire is for the payload system to provide both capabilities. &nbsp;If your solution does not, simply document the need for another mesh comm payload as a ground rule for operation.</li><li>&nbsp;Yes, that's correct.</li><li>The topic is written in such a way as to allow for either design idea. &nbsp;Simply document your use cases and assumptions. Also, see the answer in #5 about “swarming” and the wide range of RF threats and bands.</li></ol>

Q3 (06/03/2025): The Phase II description specifies a system of at least 3 sUAS and a target system cost of $10k. &nbsp;Is that cost for each sUAS or the group combined? &nbsp;&nbsp;
A: Target system cost of $10k is for each sUAS. &nbsp;Not for the group combined.

Q4 (05/22/2025): <ol><li>What are the threshold and objective frequencies that need to be covered?</li><li>Are there priorities on system capabilities for the following:<ol><li>Geolocation</li><li>Jamming</li><li>Spoofing</li></ol></li><li>What is your primary signals of interest?<ol><li>Communications</li><li>Radar</li><li>Both</li></ol></li><li>Phase II mentions a target cost for $10k. Is this a full rate production cost or prototype cost?</li><li>If full rate production cost is greater than $10k, is this acceptable? Is $20-30k acceptable, depending on capability?</li></ol>
A: Answers:<ol><li>No threshold or objective. &nbsp;The topic description is written in such a way to allow for a wide range of RF bands, threats, and a wide range of concept solutions.&nbsp; Please note the description does state “non-tailored EW effects”, which generally refers to area denial and broad application.&nbsp; Feel free to propose whatever you think best fits the description</li><li>No priorities.</li><li>Both. &nbsp;The topic description is written in such a way to allow for a wide range of RF bands, threats, and a wide range of concept solutions.&nbsp; Please note the description does state “non-tailored EW effects”, which generally refers to area denial and broad application.&nbsp; Feel free to propose whatever you think best fits the description</li><li>There is no good way to answer this given there is no targeted program of record … yet. &nbsp;Full rate production could be described as the 15th or 20th or 1000th unit. &nbsp;Having said that, the $10,000 target serves as a design-to-cost objective for the ""ultimate"" production unit cost, guiding innovation towards affordability and scalability. Phase I and II efforts should demonstrate a clear path toward achieving this target through efficient design and component selection.</li><li>This question is outside the bounds of clarifying the requirements. &nbsp;It's asking to pre-evaluate a proposal, which as the TPOC, I cannot do.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol>",,Information Systems,1,Information Systems,Integrated Sensing and Cyber,Integrated Sensing and Cyber,1,"Electronic warfare, small uncrewed aerial systems, denied environment, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, force protection",1,"Electronic warfare, small uncrewed aerial systems, denied environment, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, force protection",Yes,1,Yes,,"Develop low-cost payloads, along with supporting architecture, for sUAS platforms (Group 3 and below) capable of delivering coordinated and scalable EW effects (e.g., geolocation, jamming, spoofing, etc.) on target, en masse.",31,"Develop low-cost payloads, along with supporting architecture, for sUAS platforms (Group 3 and below) capable of delivering coordinated and scalable EW effects (e.g., geolocation, jamming, spoofing, etc.) on target, en masse.","Electronic warfare (EW) refers to the use of electromagnetic energy to control the electromagnetic spectrum and deny, disrupt, or deceive enemy systems. EW is a critical aspect of modern warfare, identified as a cross-cutting enabler for the operational imperatives (see Reference 1), and is considered an essential element of achieving success on the battlefield.The application of EW effects can provide a significant strategic advantage, disrupting the enemy’s coordination/communication, preventing the enemy from effectively targeting friendly forces, providing valuable intelligence on enemy locations, intentions, and capabilities, or by creating confusion (Reference 2).

Physics also comes into play as platforms in the air domain use the atmospheric properties to provide lift that enables maneuver, whereas in the space domain, non-air breathing propulsion systems are needed for maneuver. This topic seeks to explore concepts of operation for systems that can seamlessly operate between the air and space domains, specifically at altitudes of 100kft and 330kft, or 30km to 100km. The ability to operate in the Stratosphere, Mesosphere, and Thermosphere and transvers these domains could provide combatant commanders a new operational capability that has not been fully explored. Technology advancements have created an emerging opportunity with significant potential for the Department of the Air Force (DAF) missions by enabling the ability to operate with long endurance in the near-space, low ionosphere region (30km &ndash; 100 km). Proposals should leverage relatively mature technology areas (sensors, fusion, position, timing, communications, command & control, and sensor planning) and show the potential for new system-level capability that enhances the DAF mission in the near-space region. Proposals should consider experimentation approaches that create an immediate and affordable impact on capabilities. Also of interest are proposals that examine fast-responsive approaches to deliver the platform.Capabilities sought include Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and material transport, but proposers are encouraged to consider any innovative payload that enhances tactical DOD capability. Payloads that focus on Communications or Position, navigation and Timing (PNT) augmentation are discouraged unless they offer a truly game-changing capability. Selected offerors will work with the government sponsor to integrate and transition promising new capabilities into the DAF (USAF-USSF) digital infrastructure.The ability to conduct missions where capability rapidly transitions between the air and space domains can greatly enhance DAF effectiveness. Technology developments are paving the way where situational awareness and target tracking do not have to rely solely on sensors integrated into the platform, such as a tactical fighter or unmanned system, even in highly-contested operational environments. Aggregated and fused space sensing data from multiple sources can be used to develop domain awareness in the air theater. In addition, current and planned commercial communications systems are developing and fielding the technology for space-based communications and the reliance on direct line-of sight may no longer be needed &ndash; truly enabling a distributed, network centric warfighting capability.Current commercial capabilities can lift payloads to approximately 100kft, such as a high-altitude ballon or lift payloads via rocket to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Commercial capabilities to lift payloads above 100kft are expensive, complicated, and limited on their lift capabilities. Technology operating in LEO are unable to maintain a presence in a central location for long periods of time, orbiting the earth approximately every 90 minutes, while also having the limitation of requiring launch vehicles to place them into orbit.

The objective of this task is to design a three port, coaxial transmission line device that would accept two coaxial transmission line inputs and combine the cables into a single, quad axial output for feeding attacked antennas. The outer two conductors split off first to feed the lower antenna, while the inner coax continues up the mast to feed an additional antenna.",201,1267,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70527/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70527/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,86.6 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:47:27,,,,,N86-157_70527,DOD_SBIR_86_P1_C6_N86-157,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:30.22727+00

The intent is to reconfigure an application’s attack surface, location, and communication methods with only minimal impact to the operation of the asset. The asset may continue to run in a new configuration, which may reside in a different DoD-approved cloud, with new network addresses, with changed security component components, and may communicate internally with different protocols. One important aspect of reconfiguring a N-tier instantiation is being able to define the logical pattern of the application in terms of application components, such as contemporary servers, communications paths, ports, and protocols, and security components. Once these pattern requirements are known, then logically equivalent substitutions can be made for the purpose of changing the attack surface. For example, if Server 1 communicates with Server 2, using protocol A, then the same effective communication can occur through a different communication path, between different addresses, possibly in different cloud IaaS.","This phase will focus on the commercialization of the technology.

This enables devices to communicate with each other for coordinated operation as well as communicating with a centralized control system. These network connections also allow designated administrators convenient maintenance and administration of the devices. However, these network connections create additional threat vectors into devices controlling critical systems. Furthermore, many of these devices run on proprietary firmware that is closed (unreadable) and rarely updated. As a result, organizations must connect these devices to some portion of the network even though there are very limited use cases for these devices to communicate. Traditional firewalls can help limit traffic in and out of designated areas. However, most firewalls enforce rules based on arbitrary (also dynamic and spoofable) addresses such as internet protocol (IP) addresses. Furthermore, inside the protection of a firewall, devices are still able to communicate laterally and still often visible to the rest of the network. Any misconfiguration of either the device or the firewall is catastrophic. To resolve this problem, an additional name space (apart from IP addressing) is required to abstract the (permanent) identity of a device from the device’s corresponding addresses. Rather than using IP addresses to connect, connections now use the host identifier instead, providing a more reliable attribute of identity. One such implementation is Host Identity Protocol (HIP) which adds a “host identifier” in the form of a cryptographic public key associated with the host.

Thus a detailed sensitivity analysis and requirements flow down will be a critical part of the project. The initial target LGS AO system is a 1-4m class telescope with a side-launched sodium or Rayleigh beacon. While the primary focus of the development effort is on simulating LGS beacons, the simulator must also include atmospheric turbulence to be effective. The turbulence simulator should include at least two Komologrov phase screens and be capable of generating atmospheric parameters covering a range of coherence lengths: threshold of 3-15 cm, objective of 1.5-20 cm; isoplanatic angle: threshold of 4 &ndash; 15 &micro;rad, objective of 2-20 &micro;rad; and greenwood frequency: threshold: 0-500 Hz, objective 0-1000 Hz. It is also highly desirable to have an option to remove turbulence effects for alignment and troubleshooting work. The sensitivity analysis should at a minimum consider the effects of beacon parameters on the most common LGS AO wavefront sensor (WFS), the Shack-Hartmann WFS (SHWFS), but ideally the sensitivity analysis would consider multiple WFS or be WFS agnostic to ensure future testing of new WFS concepts is also supported. For example, it's possible that the proposed method for simulating an elongated sodium beacon is not compatible with accurately simulating beacon jitter (i.e. jitter due to the laser launch telescope). At a minimum, the sensitivity analysis would be used to determine whether beacon jitter or beacon elongation has a more deleterious effect on the LGS AO performance of the baseline system and thus inform system development. Ideally, the sensitivity analysis would also include potential uses of the simulator for future development efforts. This additional analysis is more open ended and difficult, but a review of the current literature on LGS AO systems can be used to anticipate some possible use cases of a LGS source/turbulence simulator. A few examples include: laser tomography to mitigate focus anisoplanatism, uplink correction of the laser beacon, combining measurements from different beacon types (Rayleigh, Sodium, and/or natural), pulsed sodium systems to minimize beacon elongation, alternative WFS concepts (i.e. the Ingot WFS), etc. For example, when developing a method for generating multiple sodium beacons or multiple Rayleigh beacons, the effect of adding additional beacons on mitigating focus anisoplanatism can be estimated given the altitude of the beacons, the size of the telescope, and the turbulence profile. Thus a sensitivity analysis can be used to justify a limited number of beacons if necessary to meet system level trade-offs or budget constraints. In short, the initial stages of the project will focus not only on developing methods to simulate LGS beacons and atmospheric turbulence, but also the analysis necessary to make intelligent trade-offs in the final system design. The sensitivity analysis will also feed into requirements development and flow-down for development of techniques to simulate various aspects of the laser beacon. Requirements development should be done concurrently with the sensitivity analysis in an iterative process to identify limitations that may necessitate different designs or restrictions in capabilities. While most design and development work is anticipated to be based on computer simulation, any techniques that are key to the overall function and/or higher risk should be tested in a standalone hardware configuration. For example, the technique for generating an extended beacon is critical to the overall simulation of an LGS beacon and thus should be demonstrated with physical hardware. The demonstration can be at the component level and does not need to include the turbulence simulation or other aspects of the beacon simulation (jitter, Rayleigh scatter contamination, etc.). Once concepts are fully developed and critical concepts are demonstrated on an individual/component level, work will shift toward integration of the various components into a complete LGS source/turbulence simulator. The initial integration work will focus on simulating the most important LGS beacon parameters (as determined by the sensitivity analysis) in a turbulence simulator. The initial integrated design should be capable of simulating at least one beacon of each type (Rayleigh, Sodium, and a target or natural guidestar) with atmospheric turbulence effects (both uplink and downlink for LGS beacons), and demonstrate the capability to vary beacon and turbulence parameters with predictable and repeatable results. The design should include options for more advanced simulation scenarios, e.g. multiple beacons, uplink correction, etc., but initial testing will focus on thorough testing of basic system functionality and only move onto testing more complicated scenarios once basic functionality testing is successful. The integrated system should be small enough to fit on a standard optical bench (less than roughly 6'x8'x4' volume), have an optical output power of at least 1 &micro;W/cm^2 to the AO system using Class 3B lasers (objective: optical efficiency >1%), and have an output beam of ~1&rdquo; in diameter. The initial system should be capable of operating over visible wavelengths but does not need to use laser sources that match standard Rayleigh and Sodium wavelengths. Ideally the system would be wavelength agnostic so that the end user could integrate any desired beacon wavelength, but at a minimum the system needs to simulate two different wavelengths (one for Rayleigh and one for Sodium, separated by at least 50 nm) and support a visible or near infrared broadband target source (>100 nm bandwidth). Once initial functionality has been demonstrated and tested, additional capabilities will be integrated and tested with the goal of identifying any system limitations or shortfalls that can be mitigated or resolved in later designs. If the initial integration stage is successful, further development will focus on optimizing the design for integration onto a LGS AO system that is capable of on-sky testing, either through modifications and redesign of the initial system or a completely new system design. The primary goal of integrating with a full-up LGS AO system would be to enable comparison testing between on-sky and bench results. Once again, analysis and testing would focus on identifying system limitations and shortfalls that can be used to improve future LGS ATS designs. Ultimately, the project should support the development of a robust LGS ATS capability that can be deployed onto multiple systems and be used to rapidly test new LGS AO technologies in support of Air Force and Space Force missions. The technology developed in this project can also be readily transitioned to support LGS AO systems on astronomical telescopes where a more realistic source/turbulence simulator could be very valuable for maximizing observation time.

Specifically, this material system exhibits tunability across the infrared (3.5-14 &micro;m), high-quality and large area lattice-matched substrate, mature processing technology, and as of this year demonstration of long minority carrier lifetimes necessary for high performance photo detection [1]. This recent demonstration of long minority carrier lifetime in InAsSbBi is significant because the lifetime reflects how long charge excited by incoming infrared radiation can transport in the material before it can no longer be collected by the EO/IR system, i.e. the likelihood that the photon is seen. Long lifetimes lead to efficient collection of charge and low dark currents, two key attributes of an efficient, high signal-to-noise image sensor. While other measures of performance are associated with the material's fundamental nature (e.g. mobility, absorption, etc.), lifetime is fundamentally a measure of concentration of defects in the material and thus the lifetime is improved by innovation and advances in the material synthesis. As discussed in greater detail in Ref. [1], the challenge to further improving InAsSbBi for infrared-sensing applications is that higher growth temperatures are required to further improve the material's minority carrier lifetime, but those temperatures significantly inhibit the incorporation of Bi. Increasing growth temperature shortens the maximum cutoff wavelength of the material as Bi, the element responsible for reducing the bandgap, incorporates less efficiently. The path forward for InAsSbBi will require either a novel growth approach that enables more effective incorporation of Bi in InAsSbBi at higher growth temperatures where the minority carrier lifetime is maximized, or a means of passivating defects present in InAsSbBi alloys grown at lower growth temperatures where Bi incorporates more efficiently. This topic seeks to evaluate post-growth hydrogenation as a means to passivate defects and improve the minority carrier lifetime in low-temperature-grown InAsSbBi alloys. Hydrogenation is commonly used to passivate defects in a multitude of materials, and has been shown to improve the minority carrier lifetime in other III-V infrared semiconductor materials. Given that the lifetime of InAsSbBi is not a function of the Bi mole fraction but rather the growth conditions utilized to synthesize the material, it is possible that the defects introduced at lower growth temperatures can be passivated, leading to long lifetime InAsSbBi alloys with sufficient Bi mole fraction to effectively cover the mid- to long-wave infrared spectrum.",436,3045,1,No,No,No,,Development of a hydrogenation recipe and test plan.

<a href=""http://omegaoptics.com/technologies/printed-electronics/"" target=""_blank"">Printed Electronics &ndash; Omega Optics</a>

To come up with a novel approach covering 1-8 GHz with our existing infrastructure, we have employed artificial intelligence and machine learning to come up with a novel meta-aperture&nbsp;array&nbsp;that can do 2-D steering with a much larger steering angle due to the smaller aperture.&nbsp; We, therefore, plan to do a direct&nbsp;phase&nbsp;2 submission.&nbsp; Since it is a bigger task to prepare a quality&nbsp;phase&nbsp;2 proposal, is it possible to have a short presentation online before we submit the proposal to ensure our work aligns well with your expectation.&nbsp; Since it is printing electronics, it is an intrinsically low weight with high accuracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Please let us know if we can have a quick meeting soon due to the closeness of the deadline.

Thanks for your attention.

Additionally, ground testing has shown it can also be used for station-keeping using low-thrust electrical propulsion systems. As a dual-use, single source fuel, ASCENT enables the elimination of one of the two satellite fuel delivery and storage systems used on today's satellite systems; saving cost, weight, and space. Moreover, ASCENT burns 30% hotter than SOA hydrazine propellant, increasing propulsive efficiency with a demonstrated 50% increase in time-on-station. Not only do these factors reduce the associated cost, weight, and complexity of current systems, they also streamline the logistical footprint to service such vehicles-a consideration that is amplified by the fact that ASCENT is a green propellant with far less toxicity and handling issues than SOA hydrazine. In short, ASCENT has the ability to transform in-space propulsion and logistics. A key challenge in realizing the benefits of the ASCENT propellant is the aggressive combustion environment that it creates and how harsh it is on available SOA materials. Current hydrazine propulsion systems require a catalyst bed, bedplate, and thruster nozzle all of which are made out of costly iridium metal (Ir). These components are subject to efficiency and life limiting issues due to the much hotter ASCENT propellant. The higher heat loads cause morphological changes in the Iridium microstructure via sintering of the catalyst bed particles and gain growth within the catalyst particles as well as the bedplate and nozzle. Sintering in the catalyst bed results in localized propellant pooling, uneven ignition and leads to charring of the propellant which then blocks the local area for future combustion. This reduces performance and causes non-uniform pressures and heat loads within the bed. Whereas grain growth reduces material strength and fracture toughness. Both of these phenomena results in component failure due to both cyclic thermal shock and fatigue. The goal of this project is to identify (by modeling) and test new ultra higher temperature materials for the catalysis bed material to minimize sintering and grain growth. Additionally, improve the catalysis architecture to minimize uneven distribution of pore volume that causes pressure and thermal gradients. These two task will help to improve catalysis bed life as well as the other components life by a factor up to 20X.",394,"The AF and NASA have recently shown via flight experiments that the ASCENT (Advanced Spacecraft Energetic Non-Toxic) propellant can be used for high-thrust chemical propulsion needed for orbit transfer and debris avoidance.

The higher heat loads cause morphological changes in the Iridium microstructure via sintering of the catalyst bed particles and gain growth within the catalyst particles as well as the bedplate and nozzle. Sintering in the catalyst bed results in localized propellant pooling, uneven ignition and leads to charring of the propellant which then blocks the local area for future combustion. This reduces performance and causes non-uniform pressures and heat loads within the bed. Whereas grain growth reduces material strength and fracture toughness. Both of these phenomena results in component failure due to both cyclic thermal shock and fatigue. The goal of this project is to identify (by modeling) and test new ultra higher temperature materials for the catalysis bed material to minimize sintering and grain growth. Additionally, improve the catalysis architecture to minimize uneven distribution of pore volume that causes pressure and thermal gradients. These two task will help to improve catalysis bed life as well as the other components life by a factor up to 20X.","This topic is focused on filling a capability gap in emerging space propulsion technology. It will first use new material modeling methods for assessing catalysis bed materials (chemistry, architecture and degradation) for increase lifetime in the ASCENT propellant. Promising chemistries and designs will be fabricated and sent to AFRL/RQR for lifetime testing. Post tested beds will be characterize by the contractor and the results used to improve the modeling. Lifetimes improvements of 20X will be the goal.",77,512,1,No,No,No,,"This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into a Phase II. Therefore, a Phase I award is not required.

A: A &quot;tip-and-cue&quot; CONOPS is envisioned to achieve space domain awareness (SDA) of the vast cislunar domain.&nbsp; If the delivery is a &quot;tipping&quot; system, it would search for new objects.&nbsp; If it is a &quot;cued&quot; system, it would likely observe and maintain custody of known objects.

Q2 (06/01/2022): Is orbital determination of the observed objects also of interest? Is there an accuracy requirement on the object velocity or only the position?
A: Yes.&nbsp; From the solicitation, &quot;Tracking accuracy (goal of better than 5 arc&nbsp;seconds).&quot;

Q3 (06/01/2022): Please clarify exactly what level of prototype you seek. For example, this is this an engineering development prototype, a qualification unit, a brassboard (form, fit or function equivalent but not with flight heritage parts), or some other level of flight maturity? Are COTS-equivalent components acceptable?
A: This SBIR will be run out of AFRL&#39;s Center for Rapid Innovation (AFRL/CRI).&nbsp; AFRL/CRI favors operational demonstration of higher-TRL items over design/development of lower-TRL items.&nbsp; As a result, we seek a prototype suitable for an on-orbit contextual demonstration.&nbsp; Any information to quantify the technical steps (and associated cost and schedule) to transition from the SBIR deliverable to an on-orbit demonstrable item is very helpful.

Q4 (06/01/2022): Is GEVs qualification required at the system level, or is the use of GEVs qualified parts and analyses sufficient?
A: It is not required, but GEVs is considered a valid enveloping set of standards for space qualification.

Q5 (05/31/2022): Is cost sharing required, or given preference?
A: This SBIR will be run out of AFRL&#39;s Center for Rapid Innovation (AFRL/CRI).&nbsp; AFRL/CRI favors operational demonstration of higher-TRL items over design/development of lower-TRL items.&nbsp; As a result, executability and viability towards an on-orbit contextual demonstration&nbsp;is considered.&nbsp; If cost sharing part of that strategy, then it is considered.

Q6 (05/27/2022): The solicitation indicates &quot;demonstrate performance of a prototype system through laboratory testing&quot; Can you please clarify what is the fidelity of the prototype system for the laboratory&nbsp;testing? Thank you.
A: It is our goal to transition deliverables from this SBIR to space for an Operationally-relevant on-orbit assessment.&nbsp; If the SBIR deliverable is not space qualified and suitable from an xGEO/cislunar environment, please identify the steps (along with projected cost/schedule) to evolve the delivery to that state.

Q8 (05/06/2022): Can you clarify item&nbsp;iii. Number of observations / day (goal of 500 or more)? The given numbers indicate ~3 &quot;observations&quot; per minute. Can it be concluded that an &quot;observation&quot; is a single image of a single target?

&nbsp;

and relatedly, can it be assumed that many, many targets will likely be observed over a single day?
A: Both of the following would compose multiple &quot;observations&quot;:

1. A single image of a single target, followed by another single observation of another target (e.g., domain surveillance).

2. A single image of a target, followed by another image of the same target (e.g., persistent custody).

Until now, the limits of that mission have been in near Earth, out to roughly geostationary (GEO) range (approximately 36,000 km). With new US public and private sector operations extending into cislunar space, the reach of USSF's sphere of interest will extend to 450,000 km and beyond &ndash; more than a tenfold increase in range and 1,000-fold expansion in service volume. USSF now has an even greater surveillance task for space domain awareness in that region, but its current capabilities and architecture are limited by technologies and an architecture designed for the legacy mission. Existing ground and near earth sensors are not only stressed by the increased range and volume, but also by background from lunar albedo for objects near the moon, obstruction from the moon itself, and the chaotic nature of orbits acted on by the gravity of both Moon and Earth which causes trajectory estimation to become more complicated. Additionally, there are a large range of orbits, trajectories and timelines for objects traversing or operating in this regime, where some orbits take hours to complete and some take weeks. To address the challenges posed to the current architecture, the USSF is exploring space-based sensors operating in lunar or cislunar orbits, not only to provide access to the large volume to be surveilled, but also to address gaps of current coverage posed by the bright lunar background or the moon itself. Several alternative architectures are being considered, including proliferation of sensors in various lunar and Earth-Moon periodic orbits, or a few sensors in Earth-Moon Lagrange points. The former would benefit from low cost optical sensors for economy in scale, and the latter with high sensitivity for detection at long ranges with fewer sensors. Both would benefit from a compact and lightweight sensor, and the capability for wide area search and discovery of objects in unknown or complex orbits.

Government and commercial ground-based telescopes were proliferated to maximize the number of observations and awareness of the space domain. As a result of the significant increase in data volume, space domain awareness architectures have been driven to automate the processing and exploitation of optical imagery. Most images are never viewed or inspected by a human operator. Potential threat events, such as Closely Spaced Objects (CSOs) and breakup events are easily identified visually in calibrated imagery; however, it is not practical to send frames or thumbnails to a centralized location for visual inspection. This process stresses the available communications bandwidth and is manually intensive. As a result, the warfighter must wait for minutes to hours while the extracted detections are filtered, frame-to-frame associated, correlated to known objects, classified as Uncorrelated Targets (UCTs), and deemed a potential threat by additional processing. This information is commonly insufficient to determine threat levels and the operator must request imagery transfers to perform visual inspection which can take days to complete. Consequently, the operator is unable to effectively perform Courses of Action (COAs) selection and execution.

There is a need to assess the performance, health and degradation of large antenna arrays. For this reason, this topic seeks novel metrology solutions for space-based antennas. As large structures are built in space, the large size presents several design challenges. Orbital forces can cause the antenna elements to move, bend or flex in small, but tangible amounts that affect the performance of the individual antenna elements as well as the entire array. Likewise, the electronics that controls the antenna elements are subject to the same stresses and strains inherent within the operational space environment that may degrade or even damage these components. A novel metrology solution is sought, such as those that focuses on measuring the electromagnetic emissions of the elements to determine and assess in-situ that their performance is within the expected parameters. The solution must be able to assess the in-band performance of the elements themselves by measuring the sidebands, scattering, etc. as well as the out-of-band emissions from the elements, interconnects and active electronics that control the elements. The sensor design must be ultra-lightweight to meet space Size Weight and Power (SWaP) requirements. It must be capable of capturing emissions at greater than 170 dBm sensitivity while still maintaining adequate dynamic range to function near a high-power antenna array. The sensor must have broadband collection capability to assess both in-band and out-of-band emissions and have the Radio Frequency (RF)/microwave collection capability and processing tightly integrated to achieve the required performance.",257,1727,1,No,No,No,,"During the Phase I effort, a prototype system will be developed to demonstrate the technical feasibility for a sensor and antenna configuration for novel metrology of space-based antennas.","Complete development of a prototype system determined to be the most feasible solution.

1-2 meters will be enough? Between 1- 5 m, would you please give me some range?

As a small business, we don&#39;t have a large facility and it costs a lot more if the prototype is too big.

If it is scalable, can we make it like 1-2 meter diameter size? Thank you!

&nbsp;
A: A sub-scale prototype (1-2 m) for a larger design (greater than 5 m) is acceptable.

Q2 (09/09/2022): Thank you so much for the timely topic.

We plan to propose in-space assembly of scalable, reconfigurable, shape-changing, expandable/shrinkable antenna.

How much effort should be focused on demonstrating the antenna functionality after the assembly?

If the&nbsp;experimental radiation efficiency of the reflector surface material is published already, reference will be enough?

Or should we still demonstrate its efficiency after assembly? If not, what kind of demonstration of antenna functionality do you want to see?
A: This topic is primarily focused on the structural design and concept of operations of in-space assembly and/or manufacturing of antennas. Since reconfigurability and shape-changing capability are integral to such a proposed design, traceability to antenna performance (such as through shape measurements via non-contact scanners) would be acceptable in lieu of radiation efficiency measurements.

Q3 (09/07/2022): Is this topic open to the&nbsp;development of a single subsystem for a greater orbital manufacturing and assembly system? For example, a project focused on the development of a&nbsp; joining method or a project focused on a robotic system for handling and manipulating components. Or does the project need to develop all of the required subsystems for assembly?
A: This topic is seeking full solutions. As such, the system concept of operations should provide a convincing story on the entire process and its efficiency and advantages. It is acknowledged that such complete system concepts require additional efforts and coordination than can be facilitated under SBIR Phase I &amp; II efforts and that subsystem developments under these efforts is acceptable (provided they show traceability to the system).

Q4 (09/02/2022): Is the interest in &quot;Reversible&quot; assembly operations such as &quot;Bolt-up, Snap-Tite, magnetic, or mechanical assembly or are &quot;Irreversible&quot; assembly processes such as welding/adhesives/plastic deformation acceptable?

&nbsp;

Also many assembly processes would require &quot;Complex choreography&quot; to demonstrate, such as use of tugs, manipulators, astronauts.&nbsp; Can we assume some of these

are available as part of the architecture? Some reasonable assumptions like the ISS ARM, or a Mission Extension Vehicle make architectures possible but are somewhat expensive to demonstrate in a phase II without a lot of &quot;Simulated&quot; capability.&nbsp; Could we simulate some of those &#39;reasonably&#39;?
A: Irreversible assembly processes are acceptable. Proposed concepts should be self-contained and should not assume astronaut assistance would be available. Proposed concepts of operations of the processes may include robotic assembly or use of other third party vehicles provided sufficient justifications are given. The system concept should be included to tell a convincing story, yet subsystem development and limited simulated capabilities are acceptable under this topic.",,Space Platforms,1,Space Platforms,General Warfighting Requirements (GWR),General Warfighting Requirements (GWR),1,"<p>Space-based Antenna; OSAM; Robotics; Manufacturing; Assembly; Truss, Engineering</p>",6,<p>Space-based Antenna,Yes,1,Yes,,"Demonstrate a manufacturing or assembly system that can function on Earth, in partial gravity, or without gravity.

Less than 25% of spacecraft engineering man-hours is spent on mission specific design and manufacturing. The "" Tyranny of Launch"" and the "" Tyranny of the Fairing"" severely limit the efficiency and scale of what may be performed on-orbit. For example, unfurlable antenna systems take years to design, test, and validate; and they are used only once during a decades long mission. Unfurlable mechanisms may be deleted from the orbital engineering lexicon, if On-Orbit Manufacturing and Assembly are used instead. The aperture size of orbital systems may also be greatly increased, if On-Orbit Manufacturing and Assembly are used to distribute the antenna lift operation over multiple launches. After a Micro Meteor Orbital Debris (MMOD) collision, the truss/antenna system may be repaired, if On-Orbit Servicing is designed in. Therefore, On-Orbit Servicing Assembly and Manufacturing (OSAM) may create a lower cost, more resilient, and higher performance antenna system than ever before. OSAM also allows for the creation of pressure vessels that are too big for launch. Engineering firms may also design spacecraft after the factory itself has been launched. The OSAM reordering of launch and manufacturing operations will 4X the engineering manpower of the aerospace firms, dramatically increasing the rate of evolution of spacecraft systems.",219,1466,1,No,No,No,,"During the Phase I effort, a prototype system will be developed to demonstrate the technical feasibility On-Orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing of space-based antennas.","Large scale, autonomous manufacturing or assembly demonstration of the antenna system.

<br />
1. The listed reference does not appear to be a public DTIC report. Is there another reference available?

2. The 1 second exposure time specification with a mV &lt; 16.3 limit implies a medium-sized telescope aperture of the order ~600mm diameter. However, the PANDORA camera system referenced in the topic appears to be a camera lens array. Are the listed specs correct or is this the wrong reference? Or is this the correct spec and the PANDORA system is for reference? Or some other explination?&nbsp;&nbsp;
A: 1.&nbsp; In lieu of the unavailable reference paper we suggest the following paper &quot;Lens and Camera Arrays for Sky Surveys and Space Surveillance&quot; by Dr. Mark Ackermann (https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2016/Instrumentation_Optical-Surveillance/Zimmer.pdf) presented at the 2016 AMOS Conference.

2. We want to apologize for the errors in the RFP that were not corrected prior&nbsp;to its release.&nbsp;

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Phase 1 block should read:</strong>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Criteria for substantiating that the proposer&rsquo;s technology is currently at an acceptable stage (thus bypassing Phase 1 development) consists of the following:

Ability from a ground-based electro-optic sensor to persistently and frequently record positions the objects near to the geosynchronous earth orbits (GEO) belt to within 30deg of horizon all night long.&nbsp; Frequency of observations should exceed 0.017 Hz (i.e., integration time less than 1 minute).

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">b. Ability to routinely detect objects as faint as Mv 16.3.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">c. Ability to estimate astronomical position (such RA and Dec, celestial lat. and long., or equivalent) of a GEO from a single frame even with a relatively large instantaneous field-of-view (for example, an instantaneous field-of-view of 50 micro-radians is considered large).

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">d. Ability to show reliability and longevity of any moving parts, especially if a moving-mount is required to point towards an intended target field.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">e. Such description is expected to be included in the proposal.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">2) Publication describing the product and providing results of the successful demonstration of the product.

Q2 (09/02/2022): Could you please clarify the assumed sky brightness that corresponds to the listed magnitude limits?<br />
<br />
Similarly, can you specify the assumed apparent angular rates or range of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclinations for objects to be detected at that magnitude limit?&nbsp;
A: 1.&nbsp;It is assumed that that the vendor with a product meeting the criteria of the Phase 1 has successfully observed GEOs and has these numbers, namely for sky brightness that corresponds to the listed magnitude limits,&nbsp; apparent angular rates or range of semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclinations for objects to be detected at that magnitude limit.&nbsp; The proposer is to document in the proposal that they meet the criteria of the Phase 1 effort and to quantify the performance.&nbsp; However, a value of 20 Mv/arcsec^2 would be reasonable for the locations where this system would be expected to be installed.

2. Our assumption is that objects will be in near circular, near GEO orbits. The orbit inclination would be driven by the proposed instrument. The instrument should be able to detect objects at inclinations greater than 1 degree. Five degrees would be good. Ten degrees would be better. Twenty would be even better. Whatever inclination the instrument can observe, the instrument should be able to detect and object at that inclination.",,Sensors,1,Sensors,Directed Energy,Directed Energy,1,<p>Space Domain Awareness; SDA; COTS camera; GEODSS</p>,4,<p>Space Domain Awareness,Yes,1,Yes,,"The rise of commercial entities providing space domain awareness (SDA) data has been breathtaking to the point that the dedicated Space Surveillance Network, equipped by the U.S. Space Force, can leverage products so as to multiply the Network's capability for the space warfighter.

Telecommunication networks, data center optical interconnects, and microwave photonic systems have already demonstrated in-fiber optical communications that support most of these needs [1, 2]. In addition, optical communication is unaffected by radio frequency (RF) interference, and has a high level of security through low probability of detection (LPD) and low probability of intercept (LPI). Recent advances in photonic integrated circuits show a path towards similar performance [3,4]. Small, compact laser terminals allow for proliferated integration into ground vehicles, aircraft, and spacecraft. The ideal transmitter for these applications should operate over a large bandwidth with a small driving amplitude at high optical power, high efficiency and be cost-effective.

It will affect design.

The Topic calls for &quot;Radiation Hardened&quot; but is unclear on wether we need to test the full up system? We can do analytical or subscale testing but full up testing becomes complex. Will US Government facilities be available to validate testing done by the awardee?&nbsp;&nbsp;

The topic calls for Thermal/vac testing? Will vibe testing also be required?

The Topic calls for &quot;Testing to show electrical stability&quot;? Can the government clarify what they mean here?
A: 1.As mentioned, this is a material development topic from AFRL/RX (the Material and Manufacturing Directorate) and not an application driven topic that would come out of Organization such as AFRL/RV or USSF. The orbit of the satellite was left up to the proposer because these orbits all have different radiation conditions and dosages and this will also affect the design, testing cost and the method of testing. I would like to see a table in the proposal that show the radiation types and dosage conditions of each orbit and a discussion of why the contractor selected the orbit. Note, some orbits also have a lot of debris associated with them so impact testing should be discussed and tested if required.

2.Some radiation testing facilities exist at AFRL/RV under Dr. Jesse Mee program and Mr. Richard Netzer&nbsp;is the Rad Lab manager and can provide details about the CTA and CRADA agreements that they have in place for contractors to access these facilities. There are some requirements on their end such as a radiation test plan that must be completed prior to scheduling, and they request that the data be shared with AFRL following the test. Radiation Effects testing can also be tested at University of Cal Davis. They have 62 -63 MeV protons. http://cyclotron.crocker.ucdavis.edu/cyclotron-users/new-users/

3.&nbsp;YES

4.The structure is going to see high velocity elections from space that have to be slowed down and absorb by the structure. It also will probably see static electrons build up. All the electrons have to be bleed off somehow. So the structure has to have conductivity thru out in order to bleed off all the electrons.

Q2 (08/31/2022): 1. What is the proposed envelope size of the cubesat deployer?

2. Does the structure need to consist of a single entity or can it consist of multiple pieces put together?

3. Are there any materials that are restricted in regards to design?
A: 1a) First: What is the cube structure going to house to show that structure is <u>structurally sound</u>, <u>radiation hardened</u> and <u>robust enough</u> to house the anticipated loads and vibes. I suggested a small telescope along with its operational electronics, the communications package, and components needed to keep the satellite in the anticipated orbit.&nbsp; However, the offer could suggest another application package that they may have on hand which would show the same effects and would keep the cost down within their budget. I would think a telescope system would require a size around 2.5 to 3U = (2.5X2.5X2.5cm<sup>3</sup>) to (3X3x3cm<sup>3</sup>).

1b) Second: What orbit will the satellite operate in like LEO, MEO, GEO, Van Allen or Cis-lunar was also left up to the proposer because these orbits all have different radiation conditions and dosages and this will also effect the design, testing cost and the method of testing. I would like to see a table in the proposal that show the radiation types and dosage conditions of each orbit and a discussion of why the orbit was selected. Note, some orbits also have a lot of debris associated with them so impact testing should be discussed and tested.

2. It can be multiple but thermal expansion issues need to be&nbsp;considered so the structure doesn&rsquo;t open-up radiation pathways by thermal fatigues do to CTE differences.

3.No as long as it can meet the structural (load bearing and impact) and rad hard requirements.

This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-market fit between the proposed solution and a potential AF stakeholder. The offeror should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the AF customer.

Electromagnetic simulation of the proposed structure and communication ports and/or integral antennas and electronics should be conducted prior to manufacture with a necessary design iteration to ensure sufficient radiation protection of internal components, which themselves should be Commercial-Off-The-Shelf. Similarly, optical performance of the telescope (including integral filters) and build conditions required for a relevant level of performance in the proposed orbit should be identified either through prior work, or as part of the effort, but before manufacture A government or a non-government testing facility needs to be proposed and the cost for should tests should be included in the proposal.

To alleviate thermal control challenges, this STTR seek to combine the academic expertise of universities and the product development expertise of small businesses to develop space tolerant variable emissivity devices or coatings that can radiatively release heat from a spacecraft when it becomes too hot and curtail the heat released from a spacecraft when it is too cold. As a technology to support spacecraft operations, the variable emissivity technology sought by this STTR should provide good thermal control, have low Size, Weight, And Power (SWAP) requirements, be robust enough to tolerate the hostile conditions found in orbit, is easy to use, and is simple to incorporate into existing spacecraft designs. The degree of thermal control the technology can provided will be assessed by the maximum emissivity the technology can establish, the minimum emissivity the technology can establish, the total change in emissivity the technology can provide, and the extent the technology can establish the optimal emissivity when the spacecraft is at different temperatures. Overall SWAP will be considered as the amount of mass, volume, and power needed to install and operate the system. Robustness will be assessed as the extent the device or coating can tolerate temperature cycling and endure extended exposure to high energy photons and charged particles found in space. Ease of use will be measured by how difficult it is to get the variable emissivity technology to adopt the desired emissivity and how few reasonably probable ways the variable emissivity technology can fail can be identified.

They are &lsquo;smart' heaters, automatically and independently warming each region of the heater circuit to the designed setpoint without a temperature sensor. The electrical resistance of the heater material jumps substantially at the setpoint, inhibiting electric flow and production of heat above the setpoint temperature. Self-regulating heaters are in use in the petrochemical and automotive industries for pipe freeze protection and seat warmers. The space industry needs self-regulating heaters for propellant system heaters where allowable temperature ranges are tight and thermal environments vary in both time and space. Conventional solutions to propellant system thermal control are resource intensive, requiring much engineering design and touch labor as well as much hardware and burdening the flight computer to control the circuits. Self-regulating heaters reduce all of these resource demands. Self-regulating heaters can also provide similar benefits for other satellite heaters such as those for batteries, mechanisms, and antennas. Existing self-regulating heaters are not suited for space applications for several reasons: 1) the form factor is too large and inflexible: existing self-regulating heaters are a stiff cable while satellite self-regulating heaters must be a thin-film heater such as adhesively-applied polyimide heaters commonly used on satellites. Additionally, these heaters must be suitable to install on two orthogonal bend axes: a 1/8&rdquo; bend radius and a 3&rdquo; bend radius, 2) existing self-regulating heaters provide their resistance transition via a melt expansion process to break the percolating path; this means that existing self-regulating heaters cannot be exposed to temperatures greater than their setpoint temperature, 3) Existing self-regulating heaters are not designed to handle the space environment; specifically: vacuum, ionizing radiation, and wide thermal cycles. This topic solicits proposals to develop and commercialize self-regulating heaters for space applications that address these aforementioned insufficiencies of existing self-regulating heaters. Additionally, the materials design must be capable of tuning during manufacturing of the material for setpoint temperatures between -5 and 20 C. A 30:1 (threshold) and 100:1 (objective) turndown ratio between the electrical resistances above and below the setpoint temperature must be achieved. The technology must be capable of yielding designs operating with any voltage between 12 and 100 VDC, and must be capable of producing designs yielding 1 to 10 W/in2 heat flux at the fully ON condition. Capable to withstand exposure to environments in all of the following orbits: 5 years in low earth orbit (LEO), 10 years in middle earth orbit (MEO), or 15 years in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) including vacuum, ionizing radiation, and thermal cycling. Radiation environments should assume the technology receives 40 mils of spacecraft Aluminum shielding (threshold) or no additional shielding (objective); radiation shields incorporated in the heater will be considered but radiation-hardened heater materials are strongly preferred. Thermal cycles between -5 and 40 C, with LEO 60k cycles, MEO 15k cycles, and GEO 6k cycles. Also survive up to 10 thermal cycles from -40 to 70 C. The material should always remain a solid. The manufacturing process should be scalable, e.g. screen printing techniques; the installation process should minimize touch labor.

In recent decades the amount and frequency of data collection surrounding observations, events, and situations in all domains has grown significantly. However, traditional data fusion methods have not grown to automatically insert contextual information into the data fusion process. Contextual information provides a broader understanding of an event, object, or situation. There are currently a lack of adequate solutions to reason across domains by applying multi-sourced data from both hard and soft sources to the context of events. In addition, space is becoming an increasingly contested domain which threatens our existing space assets. Hard data, namely astrometric orbit information, is the primary source by which space events are identified, but as the number and types of threats increase, it is insufficient to identify threats in real time or to provide advance warning of potential events. Additional hard data may contain information that allows events to be identified, but availability of this data is often sparse and incomplete. Soft data sources can be leveraged to aid in event identification. Conceptual Spaces (CSp) [1] is an information fusion approach that is capable of working with limited, multi-sourced data formats [2] when characterizing resident space objects and/or space events.

Aligned with TN#338 &ndash; Cislunar PNT.","Cislunar space is 1,728 times larger than the volume of space within 1 GEO. To operate effectively in a cislunar environment, there is a critical need for a GPS comparable navigation system for spacecraft in cislunar space to identify their exact position. Specifically, any cislunar navigation system should focus on providing navigation improvements on the Moon South Pole to allow first landings and ascending operations and ensure a good coverage for surface operation in that region. Some design tenets of cislunar navigation systems must operate in unstable families of non-planar and non-ellipses. Emerging cislunar navigation technologies need to address operational challenges of large scales of space and time involved in traditional two-way ranging with ground stations on earth, advanced timekeeping and time transfer in a cislunar environment, in addition of the confluence of terrestrial, lunar, and solar gravitational fields. Therefore, the challenge for this topic solicitation is to develop an onboard navigation system that is in support of DoD missions for rapid deployment anywhere and anytime, designed to work with much weaker signals, reduced geometric diversity and limited signal availability from the Earth's Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) or ranging with ground stations. Investigations conducted will include: i) new concepts and algorithms to take advantage of the availability of multi-constellation, multi-frequency and multi-signal GNSS; ii) use of less expensive onboard clocks by reducing the need for time stability between GNSS signal measurements and X-ray pulsar detectors; and iii) advanced filtering and data fusion, improved space and surface location algorithms.

With the assumption that there is some agency behind the control of a space object, what tools and algorithms can be developed on available data that will enable the precise estimation of that object's intent? The ability to estimate both an object's intent and its state simultaneously will enable more-informed decision-making in the space domain. Furthermore, we seek solutions that enable these methods to be implemented on-board a spacecraft, enhancing its autonomous capabilities.","Although there does not yet exist a collectively-agreed upon definition of autonomy amongst academic circles, the core idea is often some variation on the following: a machine-driven system that (i) receives data, (ii) interprets that data into some form of knowledge representation, and (iii) uses that knowledge representation to make decisions and accomplish some predefined task without human input. As the space domain becomes increasingly contested and congested with a rapidly-growing population of space objects there is a need to improve the on-board autonomous capabilities of high-valued assets. A promising avenue to do this is through informed decision-making based on the state and intent estimates of nearby objects. While state estimation techniques have been studied for decades, intent estimation is a relatively unexplored area. The ultimate aim is to infer the intent of an agent from available data (e.g. sensor observations, process dynamics, historical patterns of behavior). There are many open research questions regarding this topic - what types of uncertainty (aleatory, epistemic) are most applicable to intent characterization? Given that many forms of space-based data offer ambiguous interpretations of intent, i.e. available evidence may point to multiple mutually-exclusive hypotheses simultaneously, how can this be leveraged with current mathematical frameworks, such as Kolmogorov's axioms of modern probability or belief function theory? What information theoretics (e.g. Kullback-Leibler divergence, Mahalanobis distance, etc...) can be utilized to yield intent estimation metrics? Thus, the objective of this SBIR is to investigate these research problems and develop mathematically-rigorous algorithms that supply intent estimates of nearby space objects.

It is well known that the plasma in these layers impacts propagation at radio frequencies (RF). When the ionosphere is smoothly and slowly varying, it is generally straight forward to model these impacts. The ionosphere, however, is not always in a behaved and well-defined state. Irregular ionospheric structures severely alter RF propagation or produce scintillation. Numerous mechanisms exist that cause irregular structure in the ionosphere. One such mechanism is Sporadic E, which can be described as an unusually dense E layer that sporadically appears for relatively short periods of time. Sporadic E can sometime be so dense that it completely blocks skywave propagation to and from the F layer. When this blocking occurs, the phenomenon is often referred to as blanketing E. It is generally accepted that Sporadic E forms when long lasting meteoritic ions are pushed into a thin, dense layer due to wind shear interactions and the geomagnetic field. Sporadic E occurrence is modulated on timescales from years to hours. Annually, sporadic E occurs much more frequently in the summer. Daily, it is modulated by the semi-diurnal tides, which trigger a descending horizontalwind shear in the thermosphere twice a day. These descending wind shears have been observed in wind measurements as well in measurements of descending sporadic E layers. Additionally, it has been shown that Sporadic E is modulated by quasi-periodic planetary waves with periods ranging from a few days to a few weeks (Haldoupis and Pancheva 2002). It is not exactly known how the planetary waves produce the sporadic E modulation, but the effects are easy to measure. Ionosondes, which measure the electron density as a function of altitude, are the primary tool used for detecting sporadic E. In fact, the term sporadic E is a descriptive term used to describe ionograms (ionosonde measurements) that are affected by the overly dense E layer phenomenon. Since sporadic E is such a thin layer, the only two measured characteristics are the height and peak plasma frequency. These two parameters could then be input into a RF propagation model to determine the geometric impacts. Based on recent observations, the length scales of dense sporadic E structures are on the order of 10s to 100s of km, depending on the orientation. The goal of this topic, however, is not to characterize the exact morphology of sporadic E, rather we intend to predict the occurrence rate and characteristics of sporadic E at any point on Earth. Since it is difficult to globally monitor the drivers of sporadic E (thermospheric winds and meteoritic seed populations), a physics-based forecast model may be impractical. The impacts of sporadic E, however, are regularly observed by numerous instruments, including ionosonde networks and GNSS radio occultation (RO) capable satellite constellations. Since Sporadic E is subject to global weather patterns, spatial and temporal correlation functions could adequately describe future occurrence. For instance, observations in western US today could predict observations in eastern US tomorrow, and Europe a week later. Existing global sensor networks likely provide the necessary tools to build an empirical, predictive model. Such a model currently does not exist. We seek a global forecast model that leverages existing data sources. Preference is given to publicly available data but exceptions can be made. The model should act like a weather forecast for scattered thunderstorms, where the product is a percent probability of occurrence and overall severity. The model should focus on the characteristics of Sporadic E that impact high frequency (HF; 3-30 MHz) propagation but other aspects (e.g. scintillation) can be considered as well. The model will be validated by the performer and customer by comparing predicted Sporadic E levels at Ionosonde sites or other instrument sites with actual measurements.",638,4071,1,No,No,No,,Phase I will demonstrate the feasibility of using existing data sources for use in a Sporadic E forecast model. Specifically the demonstration would include a global Sporadic E occurrence/severity study using available Ionosonde data and possibly other data sources. The feasibility of a potential model will be determined by the measured temporal and spatial correlations between stations. If a strong enough correlation exists on planetary wave size scales then the model will likely be deemed feasible by the TPOC.,Develop a data-assimilative forecast model based on the results of phase I. The model should be similar to a weather forecast model where the user can get the percent chance for Sporadic E for a given place. The forecast would stretch out days to weeks depending on how far in advance the information is statistically meaningful. The forecast model should be validated using existing data sources. New data sources through AFRL may also become available for validation. The model will be compared to median climatology estimates to determine its usefulness as a forecast tool.,"There are a number of government and private organizations that rely on accurate predictions of RF interactions with the space environment. Furthermore, the proposed model has potential use within the US Space Force Space Systems Command as well as Air Combat Command, the US Navy, and other DoD and Title 50 organizations.",1,"Haldoupis, C. and Pancheva, D.

This challenge is even greater in the beyond-GEO region where three-body gravity becomes significant, resulting in the dynamics being more nonlinear. Additionally, the increased distance between an Earth-based sensor and the object reduces the apparent motion between them, resulting in little independent information to initialize an orbit. The initial uncertainties in xGEO orbits are therefore highly non-Gaussian, which inhibits the effectiveness of traditional propagation and filtering methods. Orbits within this area of regard enable low-cost options for spacecraft to rapidly alter course and threaten terrestrial and space-based assets.

Radar, although it is expensive to build and operate, works for satellites in low-Earth orbit. However, because of the distances involved, only a few specialized ground-based radars are capable of tracking satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Compared to ground-to-space radars, ground-based optical telescopes are less expensive to build and operate; in addition, they work well for satellites in all orbits. However, atmospheric turbulence limits the resolution and effectiveness of ground-based optical telescopes. Laser-beacon adaptive optics is an established technique to overcome the effects of atmospheric turbulence. However, laser beacons are not usually eye-safe and present a significant hazard to pilots and the safe operation of aircraft. One type of laser beacon that is not hazardous to pilots is ultraviolet (UV) Rayleigh laser beacons. However, UV laser beacons have a number drawbacks. Before discussing these drawbacks, it is helpful to discuss the different types of laser beacons used for adaptive optics. There are two main types of laser beacons used in adaptive optics, Rayleigh beacons and sodium beacons. Rayleigh beacons are formed by scattering light from molecules of nitrogen and oxygen lower in the atmosphere; typical altitudes range from 10 km to 20 km. Pulsed lasers are typically used for Rayleigh beacons so that the light may be sampled from a particular altitude by using a technique called range gating. Because Rayleigh scattering is much stronger for shorter wavelengths of light, common wavelengths for Rayleigh beacons are 355 nm and 532 nm. Typically, the 355 nm (UV) beacons are eye-safe, but the 532 nm (visible) beacons are not eye-safe. Because Rayleigh beacons rely on scattering from air molecules, they are limited to relatively low altitudes where the density of air molecules is higher. Light from the beacon traverses a cone of air above the telescope, with the beacon at the apex of the cone and the telescope pupil at the base of the cone. If a Rayleigh beacon is used for a larger telescope, the cylindrical column of air above the telescope will not be well sampled. Because of this cone effect, Rayleigh beacons are suitable only for smaller telescopes of up to about 2 m in diameter. Sodium beacons are formed from scattering light from a layer of ionic sodium that is centered at an altitude of 90 km above the ground. Because of their high altitude, sodium beacons sample a much larger cone of air when compared to Rayleigh beacons. So, they are better suited for use with large telescopes. So, UV Rayleigh beacons are suited only for smaller telescopes. Now that we have discussed the different types of laser beacons, we can put the drawbacks of UV laser beacons in context. Astronomical telescopes usually use a series of mirrors to reflect and focus light onto sensors. The best coating for these mirrors, especially in smaller telescopes, is protected silver. However, silver does not reflect UV light efficiently. The reflectivity of typical silver coatings at 355 nm wavelength is about 0.5. A typical AO system at Nasmyth focus would have at least 5 silver-coated mirrors before the wavefront sensor. This mean about 3 percent of the UV light would make it to the wavefront sensor. Now, UV-enhanced silver coatings have much higher reflectivity at 355 nm, but that would required recoating several large mirrors, which would be costly. In addition to the issue with silver-coated mirrors, pulsed UV lasers with good beam quality required for laser beacons do not have sufficient power to form beacons bright enough for observatories with strong turbulence. For most astronomical observatories, this is not a problem, because they are located in places with weak atmospheric turbulence. However, observatories for space situational awareness (SSA) and ground stations for laser communications (lasercom) are typically located in places with stronger atmospheric turbulence. To make matters worse for SSA observatories, when a ground-based telescope tracks a satellite in low-Earth orbit, it must slew quickly across the sky. This, in effect, creates a situation that is equivalent to a strong wind blowing across the aperture of the telescope. This means the adaptive optics system must operate at a higher frame rate and higher gain to compensate for atmospheric turbulence. In addition, there's a growing need for SSA and lasercom systems to operate during the day, which means the atmospheric turbulence is much wors than it is at night. The combination of these factors means a laser beacon for SSA and lasercom purposes must be much brighter than a laser beacon for astronomy. Thus, UV Rayleigh beacons are not ideal for some applications. In the past, observatories have used human aircraft spotters and radar systems to avoid illuminating aircraft. However, human spotters are expensive to employ and they can not observe for long periods of time in potentially very cold weather. In addition, human aircraft spotters have a very difficult time spotting aircraft during the day. As for radar systems, they produce radio-frequency interference, which can adversely affect sensitive electro-optical equipment. Radar systems are expensive to operate, maintain, and calibrate, plus they produce ionizing radiation that is hazardous to personnel. Radar system also have a difficult time detecting aircraft that have a small radar cross-section. One system that meets many of the requirements is the Transponder-Based Aircraft Detector (TBAD). (http://www.aircraft-avoid.com/). However, the TBAD antenna system is too large to install on small-aperture telescopes, which may have domes with relatively small openings. Furthermore, the current antenna format can act as a sail and catch wind, which may cause jitter of the optical telescope.

Radar, although it is expensive to build and operate, works for satellites in low-Earth orbit. However, because of the distances involved, only a few specialized ground-based radars are capable of tracking satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Compared to ground-to-space radars, ground-based optical telescopes are less expensive to build and operate; in addition, they work well for satellites in all orbits. However, atmospheric turbulence limits the resolution and effectiveness of ground-based optical telescopes. Laser-beacon adaptive optics is an established technique to overcome the effects of atmospheric turbulence. However, there remain significant challenges to improving the utility and effectiveness of laser beacon adaptive optics for defense applications. There are two main types of laser beacons used in adaptive optics, Rayleigh beacons and sodium beacons. Rayleigh beacons are formed by scattering light from molecules of nitrogen and oxygen lower in the atmosphere; typical altitudes range from 10 km to 20 km. Pulsed lasers are typically used for Rayleigh beacons so that the light may be sampled from a particular altitude using a technique called range gating. Because Rayleigh scattering is much stronger for shorter wavelengths of light, common wavelengths for Rayleigh beacons are 355 nm and 532 nm. Because Rayleigh beacons rely on scattering from air molecules, they are limited to relatively low altitudes where the density of air molecules is higher. Light from the beacon traverses a cone of air above the telescope, with the beacon at the apex of the cone and the telescope pupil at the base of the cone. If a Rayleigh beacon is used for a larger telescope, the cylindrical column of air above the telescope will not be well sampled. Because of this cone effect, Rayleigh beacons are suitable only for smaller telescopes of up to 2 m in diameter. Sodium beacons are formed from scattering light from a layer of ionic sodium that is centered at an altitude of 90 km above the ground. Because of their high altitude, sodium beacons sample a much larger cone of air when compared to Rayleigh beacons. So, they are better suited for use with large telescopes. Typical current laser beacon systems for astronomical applications do not compensate the outgoing laser beam to correct for atmospheric turbulence. As a result, the laser beacon can be large and extended, especially when compared to an unresolved point source, like a star. For most astronomical observatories, this is not a problem, because they are located in places with weak atmospheric turbulence. However, observatories for space situational awareness (SSA) are typically located in places with stronger atmospheric turbulence, so their laser beacons are typically larger than those at astronomical observatories. A larger laser beacon results in lower sensitivity of the laser-beacon wavefront sensor. To make matters worse for SSA observatories, when a ground-based telescope tracks a satellite in low-Earth orbit, it must slew quickly across the sky. This, in effect, creates a situation that is equivalent to a strong wind blowing across the aperture of the telescope. This means the adaptive optics system must operate at a higher frame rate and higher gain to compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The combination of these two factors means a laser beacon for SSA purposes must be much brighter and smaller than a laser beacon for astronomy. Thus, AFRL is seeking development of systems to generate smaller more spatially coherent laser beacons to help improve the performance of adaptive optics systems for ground-to-space imaging applications.",588,3806,1,No,No,No,,"As this is a Direct-to-Phase-II (D2P2) topic, no Phase I awards will be made as a result of this topic.

If successful, a prospective integrated design could provide improved utilization of the spectrum and orbit resources by sharing the spectrum for navigation and communication. Moreover, it would reduce hardware/software complexity and power consumption by sharing radio frequency (RF) front end and signal processing unit, which are common to both communication and navigation. Also relevant is that it would leverage functional synergies of communication and navigation to improve the positioning speed via higher communication rate and alleviate the signal synchronization burden via timing information. However, the key challenge is to meet different requirements, namely high data rate and precise and trustworthy positioning/timing, with a single signaling system. Most previous efforts have explored these requirements in isolation. Navigation and communication functions are implemented independently without deep integration, and the spectrum resources are used separately. Furthermore, the message authentication mechanisms for secure and trustworthy satellite navigation and communication are implemented in isolation. The isolated design inevitably results in a waste of radio resources, increased hardware/software complexity, and degradation of network performance. This topic solicitation seeks a proof of concept to meet all the communication, navigation, and authentication requirements in a single design framework. Signaling solutions that provide: i) high data rates with low transmission power, ii) trustworthy position, navigation, and timing services with reduced hardware/software complexity and power consumption, and iii) reduced spectrum usage, are desirable. Solutions that are backward compatible with the existing navigation system, i.e., providing navigation services with the existing navigation receiver without any modification, are of interest under this call.

Recently, DoD has made significant efforts to leverage commercial 5G investments in vendors and operators that are untrusted. Those initiatives that rely on commercial 5G products, create emerging security challenges involving in data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Concerning the Fighting Satellite Communication (SATCOM) vision by US Space Command that requires future military SATCOM capable of multi-band and multi-waveform operations, whenever possible, to support agile, path-agnostic connectivity, reducing vulnerability to interference and jamming, this topic solicitation is to focus on potential cross-cutting areas required to integrate 5G terrestrial networks with military satellite networks.

One technique for removing these electrons is to mimic nature with electromagnetic (EM) Whistler waves that are known to scatter electrons onto trajectories aligned with the magnetic field, where they are lost into the atmosphere [Starks, 2020]. The recent DSX (Demonstration and Science Experiment) mission [Johnston, 2023] successfully demonstrated transmission by an 80 m dipole antenna and reception by a remote satellite. While DSX was able to measure the dissipated power, it was unable to quantify the efficiency of radiation versus local dissipation i.e., plasma heating. Since follow-on systems must be precision engineered for a required size, weight, and power, this topic calls for a numerical model capable of representing antenna concepts in realistic detail while modeling both the local plasma response and the distant radiation including the wave mode. Whistler waves can exist in a range of modes from electrostatic (ES) to electromagnetic (EM). Current thinking holds that EM waves are more effective at modifying the electron pitch angle since the magnetic interaction consumes no energy; while antennas that are small compared to the free space VLF wavelength (100 km) preferentially excite ES waves due to the high index of refraction that matches the wavelength in plasma to the antenna size. Current antenna concepts include: the electric dipole such as with DSX, the magnetic loop antenna, the magnetic rod antenna; and engineered plasma modification for such (near the antenna) to produce non-linear beat wave interference and conversion from ES to EM radiation [Sotnikov, 2018]. The end product will be a computer plasma model capable of aiding the design of a space-based antenna immersed in the low or near Earth plasma. This model will be capable of simulating the performance of the recent DSX antenna, a 100A 20 m diameter magnetic loop, and a compact magnetic rod producing a similar dipole moment.

Lithium-Sulfur, with its 2600 W-h/kg theoretical specific energy, has been identified as a promising chemistry to achieve for the U.S. Space Force's (USSF) short-term 18650 rechargeable battery target of 450 W-h/kg. A higher energy rechargeable power source would have impacts across all areas of the USSF mission to enable spacecraft resilience and survivability. Most practical issues with Lithium-Sulfur chemistry can be attributed to &ldquo;polysulfide shuttling&rdquo;, the dissolution of Lithium Polysulfide in liquid electrolyte which results in parasitic reactions and its relatively low volumetric energy density, especially when in a small form factor battery cell such as an 18650. These reactions cause low Sulfur utilization and capacity fade, resulting in poor cycling efficiency. Recent efforts have been focused on either (1) suppressing diffusion of the dissolved polysulfides out of the cathode, or (2) protecting the lithium anode from reacting with the dissolved polysulfides. Li-S modelling is necessary to understand the technology development way-forward.

Small high-grade gyros would also have applications in counterspace uses both for offensive and defensive efforts. Laser communication terminals and hosted sensor payloads would benefit from low mass rate sensors on the gimbaled assembly.,"There is an ongoing effort to leverage unique advantages in gyro sensitivity versus size when an optical system is operated at what is termed an exceptional point. The exceptional point in a nanophotonic system which occurs when the gain and loss are balanced. The resulting operational singularity radically changes the behavior of the optical system and creates large changes in system response to external stimulus. A macro scale ring laser gyro (RLG) has sensitivity that is highly dependent on the optical ring resonator loss and the enclosed path length that the light travels. Operation of a nano scale RLG at an exceptional point promises to overcome the limitations of the very short optical path length. Utilization of the behavior singularity at the exceptional point is only possible due to recent developments in exploiting gain/loss properties in nano scale waveguides. To develop a nano scale RLG which operates at the exceptional point, you first need a nano scale RLG which operates in the standard regime of parity-time (PT) symmetry. Once that is achieved, the design can be manipulated to reach the point where parity-time symmetry breaks down and operation is at the exceptional point. This effort supports development of the PT-symmetry chip level RLG as well as error modeling for a future RLG operating at the exceptional point. The project will attempt to leverage advances in gyro technology to enable better than navigation grade performance from a single channel gyro with a one cubic inch volume. The final design should target 1 W per active channel for power consumption. The technology employed will need to be radiation hardened in the future. Target ARW is 0.005 deg/rt-hr. Bias stability at constant temperature target is 0.05 deg/hr at 30 minutes. The gyro dynamic range will be up to 10 deg/s. Performance must be maintained through TBD g acceleration in any orientation relative to the gyro sensing axis. Gyro scale factor nonlinearity from 1 deg/sec to 10 deg/sec magnitude will be less than 10 ppm after any compensation. The SF error of between +1 deg/sec and -1 deg/sec will be 0.036 deg/hr. The SF spec is 2-sigma. These performance goals are very challenging for the sensor size and could be reconsidered if the technology demonstrates promise in initial prototypes.",375,2310,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will produce a design for a chip level phase-time (PT) symmetric ring laser gyro (RLG). Further investigation into what is required to push the design to the exceptional point will be done. While the concept of an RLG operating in the mode is still at an early stage of development, it is desired to assess the practical aspects of operational use of the device. For example, operation at the exceptional point (EP) requires high bandwidth servos to assess where is the EP is and to keep the gyro at that point. Behavior on either side of the EP is drastically different than at the singularity itself. Models should be developed to assess expected instrument output in the presence of EP control loop error. Temperature sensitivity could be quite high. Models should be developed to assess required temperature stability of the nano-optical substrate needed to maintain EP operation. Phase I will design a sensor which demonstrates 50% of the required static environment performance. Brass board electronics without flight representative size are acceptable. The sensor form factor will be flight representative. Meeting the 50% static performance goal with a 1 ci sensor volume is a challenging task and will enable assessment of the technology's suitability to meet the higher performance goals. Error models of the sensor shall be presented which show a path to the target static and dynamic performance.","Phase II will produce a sensor which satisfies the complete performance requirement.

The only classified aspects are the data source that we use (which is not relevant to our algorithm) and our relationship with our end customer.

The question to AFRL is, is it permissible to submit our approach being used elsewhere in the Government as an approach to your SBIR? Also, is your SBIR focused on all orbital regimes or just LEO or GEO?

Thanks for whatever information you can provide.
A: As the TPOC I am only able to answer technical questions about the topic.&nbsp; With that being said, you approach would be of interest to us for this topic. &nbsp;In general, it is acceptable to leverage existing/prior work and approaches, but specifics on this, especially as related to data rights etc, would likely be best addressed by the AF SBIR/STTR office.

While our primary focus is GEO-and-below, all regimes including &ldquo;beyond-GEO&rdquo; or cislunar are also of interest.

A: <span style=""background:white"">(Q3) What sensor phenomenologies are currently utilized to monitor satellite motion?&nbsp; Radar? EO/IR?&nbsp; Are these sensors predominantly land based or space spaced?</span>

Both.&nbsp; Typically radar and EO/IR are used.&nbsp; Radar tends to be more common for LEO while EO/IR tends to be more common for MEO/GEO, but there are cases where each sensor is used across all regimes.&nbsp; Sensors are predominantly land-based but space-based sensors also exist.

Q10 (12/15/2023): 1. What sensors/measurements do we have access to for monitoring space object maneuvers?&nbsp; Space-based? &nbsp;Ground-based?&nbsp; Optical?&nbsp; Radar?

&nbsp;

2. Do you have a dataset or a simulator for building/evaluating solutions to this task?&nbsp; Will any data be provided to performers by the government in Phase 1?

&nbsp;

3. &quot;While the optimal solution involves observing all maneuvering satellites persistently,

such a solution is not feasible.&quot;: At what temporal granularity are we able to observe each satellite?

&nbsp;

5. What constitutes a detected space object maneuver? Is it an association with a past trajectory, classification of the motion, estimate of current motion, etc.?

&nbsp;

6. What are the different orbital regimes that are in scope for this task?
A: <i>1. What sensors/measurements do we have access to for monitoring space object maneuvers?&nbsp; Space-based? &nbsp;Ground-based?&nbsp; Optical?&nbsp; Radar?</i>

&nbsp;

All of those sensor types are relevant (space- and ground-based, optical and radar).

&nbsp;

<i>2. Do you have a dataset or a simulator for building/evaluating solutions to this task?&nbsp; Will any data be provided to performers by the government in Phase 1?</i>

&nbsp;

Government-furnished information (GFI) is not anticipated in Phase I.

&nbsp;

<i>3. &quot;While the optimal solution involves observing all maneuvering satellites persistently, such a solution is not feasible.&quot;: At what temporal granularity are we able to observe each satellite?</i>

&nbsp;

A multitude of sensor models are relevant &ndash; ranging from persistent sensing on the order of seconds, to frequent revisits on the order of minutes, to sparse observations on the order of hours.&nbsp; Understanding capabilities as related to different sensing models and strategies is relevant.

&nbsp;

<i>5. What constitutes a detected space object maneuver? Is it an association with a past trajectory, classification of the motion, estimate of current motion, etc.?</i>

&nbsp;

A detected maneuver would be a detection of artificial motion, i.e. a thruster firing by the spacecraft, typically observed as a change in the orbit.

&nbsp;

<i>6. What are the different orbital regimes that are in scope for this task?</i>

&nbsp;

A variety of different orbital regimes are of interest, primarily LEO, MEO, HEO, and GEO, although &ldquo;beyond-GEO&rdquo; could also be relevant for some applications.",,Space Platforms,1,Space Platforms,Space Technology,Space Technology,1,<p>space domain awareness; space situational awareness; space traffic management; maneuver detection</p>,4,<p>space domain awareness,Yes,1,Yes,,"Develop methods for reducing the latency in space object maneuver detection, utilizing existing sensor phenomenologies, cadences, and data types, with the objective of identifying and characterizing the maneuver with as few observations and as short of time as possible.",39,"Develop methods for reducing the latency in space object maneuver detection, utilizing existing sensor phenomenologies, cadences, and data types, with the objective of identifying and characterizing the maneuver with as few observations and as short of time as possible.","The ability to detect space object maneuvers is fundamental in enabling space domain awareness and space traffic management. When a space object maneuvers, deviations from its previous track can be sufficiently large to prohibit association of the observed object to the track. The result is an uncorrelated track (UCT), a trackable object whose origin has not yet been established. Only upon reconciliation of the UCT to a previously known object's track can the association be made so that a full state history of the track is available. This process, known colloquially as UCT resolution, typically involves the backwards and forward propagation of states to identify possible candidate maneuver times, and is often done well after the maneuver has been performed. This time lag can result in critical information about maneuvering satellites to be delayed in sharing with analysts who monitor the space object population. While the optimal solution involves observing all maneuvering satellites persistently, such a solution is not feasible. The best case is therefore for analysts to detect, characterize, and identify satellite maneuvers as soon as new observation data is collected. Solutions are sought that enable space object maneuver detection with limited latency once new observational data has been acquired. This will aid in maintaining persistent awareness of on-orbit objects. The problem is further compounded by the various orbital regimes in which important space assets reside, and the various sensor phenomenologies that dominate that regime. Solutions that bridge various orbital regimes, allowing for a comprehensive all-space solution are preferred to regime-specific solutions.",253,1703,1,No,No,No,,"Develop solution methodology.

Demonstrate how space superiority may depend on employing AI which is sufficiently trained and how space domain awareness data can be used to support this training.,"Autonomous space command and control systems are already being fielded within mega-constellations and are being considered for other space systems in deep space. Today flight dynamics teams are informed by third party space situational awareness products which are derived from different approaches to collecting data on operational spacecraft and debris. As increased activity which is considered to be dual-use becomes more prevalent, we will increasingly see the use of autonomy in addressing various challenges for which human cognition may not scale to or be capable of responding to in time. A key step in the development of AI solutions is the training of the algorithms which will do the decision-making. This effort seeks to evaluate the relative performance of such algorithms when they are trained by space domain awareness data of varying quality, density, geometric diversity, precision, and timeliness. The past few years have seen successful proximity operations in GEO, a rapid increase in maneuverable traffic in LEO, and more technology options for autonomous systems to perform enhanced services in space including life extension, refueling, inspection, etc. As more interactions between spacecraft are observed, there is an increasingly comprehensive body of data which can be used to train algorithms which enable autonomous space command and control (C2) solutions. We are already seeing evidence of this training possibly being employed today. As digital twins of space systems become available, it will be increasingly possible to model space systems, their onboard logic, and to enable training within a digital environment. As new systems are fielded, their autonomous logic can be further trained on-orbit and it will be desirable to compare on-orbit experience to models used to train within the digital environment.

A: 1. We are looking for either or both approaches combined, depending on the subject or skill being learned.

2 . S1 is driving requirements. However, 1 DOS/ Det 1 (USSF BMT) are the only ones with roles in this contract.

3. We currently use eBMT and CEREGO to facilitate virtual instruction.&nbsp;

4. We do not want to adapt to current USAF content. We would like a whole new learning experience.

5. Depending on the submissions we might like bits or pieces of some performers approaches or we may find one performer that has great ideas in all areas. If we do like bits and pieces of certain performers approaches we would like those performers to work together to ensure the overall curriculum is seamless. Right now we do not have a specific number that we are looking for.

6. Right now the Guardian trainees are limited to Ipads. They get issued Ipads at BMT to use for the 7.5 weeks. They currently do not have wearables but that may change in the future. AR/VR are not being used currently but we are open to ideas in this area.

7. The experience will be consistent for all candidates regardless of ASVAB scores. Guardian trainees do not take a physical fitness test before they get to BMT.

Q8 -&nbsp;Are there any Prime Contractors that you&rsquo;re working with to develop the Simulators and other tools to be used for the new BMT layout? If so, can we get any insight into who these parties may be, and what technologies the curriculum would be expected to utilize?
A: 1. Phase 1 would also include training aids/simulators/devices to be used by trainees

2. We are open to both

3. Right now we use CERGO and Ebmt. If the curriculum could work with those systems that would be ideal. However, we are open to other software.

4. We would be able to give you draft schedule and everything else we are trying to do different than the AF so it would not be helpful

<ol style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha"">
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Does any feasibility documentation need to be included in Volume 2 or does this information only need to be included in the Volume 5 (Feasibility Documentation) document? If required in Volume 2, where should that feasibility documentation be located in Volume 2?</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Is there a page limitation for the Feasibility Documentation file in Volume 5 documents?</li>
</ol>
A: 1) The documentation included in Volume 5 should support the claimed scientific and technical merits&nbsp;in Volume 2. If you say that your company has experience with creating&nbsp;a tool in the technical volume, there should be some supporting documentation in Volume 5 proving your tool creation and capabilities&nbsp;of the tool.

2) I am not aware of a page limitation, however, please only include information directly needed to support the proposal.

Q2 (01/20/2024): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>1) Does the project target a particular segment of space systems, like manned missions or satellites?</b>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>2) What are the anticipated or desired&nbsp; benefits in terms of cost, design efficiency, or innovation from the application of this tool?</b>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>3) What advanced technologies (e.g., AI, machine learning) will be leveraged or are desired in the tool?</b>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>4) In collaboration with Small Business Concern originated strategies, what USSF strategy is in place for bringing the developed tool to the aerospace market?</b>
A: 1) The developed tool needs to be able to convert text-based documents describing any previous AFRL space experiment in the relevant&nbsp;ground, launch, and space segments. The planned documents for this effort would include previously completed small-sat and nano-sat missions.

2)&nbsp;The amount of time required to manually create SysML models for every current or future space system is excessive; M&amp;S scenarios without including legacy systems are incomplete or possibly inaccurate with the data they provide. The developed tool is expected to save months of modeling time for each legacy system and enable more accurate modeling of future systems.

3)&nbsp;Generative AI technologies, such as Large Language Models, can be applied to the generation of digital models from existing static documentation.

4) The USSF is currently using SysML models to document&nbsp;systems and missions. A successfully developed tool would be valuable to companies desiring to work with the USSF&nbsp;and/or develop their own enterprise MBSE analysis capabilities.

Q3 (01/20/2024): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>1) What quantitative improvements (e.g., time, accuracy) are expected from the automated MBSE tool?</b>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>2) How will the tool ensure compliance with international standards for space systems engineering?</b>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>3) What validation protocols are planned for ensuring the accuracy of the generated models?</b>
A: 1)&nbsp;The amount of time required to manually create SysML models for every current or future space system is excessive; M&amp;S scenarios without including legacy systems are incomplete or possibly inaccurate with the data they provide.

2) There is a capability to add validation profiles to models but the method of standard compliance is up to the offeror.

3) The validation profile for the AFRL Space Vehicles GRM is in progress, but the current method is manual rule checking.

Q4 (01/20/2024): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>1) What specific aspects of space system design will the MBSE tool focus on improving?</b>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>2) How will the tool integrate with current MBSE methodologies used in space systems engineering?</b>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>3) What unique challenges in space systems design does the project aim to address with automation?</b>
A: 1)&nbsp;The amount of time required to manually create SysML models for every current or future space system is excessive. The tool is desired to significantly reduce the time to create SysML elements that can be reused across the space vehicle enterprise.

2) The offeror will need to develop techniques to include a Government Reference Model as a reference for the newly generated models. Ideally, the tool will expand on the AFRL Space Vehicles GRM for each mission/system.

3) There is not a current capability&nbsp;to auto-generate models of legacy systems using their design documentation or operational handbooks. The generated models would include SysML elements that could be reused across the space enterprise.

Q5 (01/17/2024): DoDI 5000.97 provides a list of artifacts normally used for digital engineering. Which of these, if any, do you expect to focus on first with respect to the solicitation&#39;s requirement&nbsp;to &quot;Demonstrate the ability to generate SysML&nbsp;models of a space system from text-based documentation&quot;?&nbsp;
A: The digital artifacts could all (4.a-m) be applicable to this effort depending on the provided source documentation. The source documents will be from completed, unclassified missions and could contain some or all of the data needed to create the digital artifacts in the output SysML model.

Q6 (01/12/2024): The SBIR solicitation doesn&#39;t call out a particular platform for MBSE. Is Cameo assumed to be the only tool that can be used, or is the USSF open to other tool options? If so, do those options include an allowance to&nbsp;use modeling tools in development by a company that produce accurate and verifiable results?
A: The tool is not mandated or provided as part of the topic, but we are currently using MagicDraw v22 (equivalent to Cameo). The proposed solution could be demonstrated in any MBSE tool&nbsp;as long as the output MBSE model is in SysML. Ideally, the SysML v2 standard will be published by time of contract award to alleviate most of the risk in using different tools.

Q7 (01/11/2024): Please list specific examples of source Mil&nbsp;Stds that you are interested in as source documents.
A: There are no&nbsp;military standard format documents guaranteed for this effort. Some standard documents could include System Requirements Review&nbsp;(SRR), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), Interface Control Document (ICD), and component/system&nbsp;specifications.

Q8 (01/11/2024): A Phase II requirement is to develop techniques to include a Government Reference Model as a reference for newly generated models. Focusing our solution appropriately would benefit from knowing the GRM you are interested in. What GRM or GRMs do you wish to use?
A: The&nbsp;AFRL Space Vehicles MBSE Style Guide and Reference Architecture, written in SysML, is the Phase II&nbsp;GRM to be expanded by the proposed solution. The GRM and source documentation will be delivered to the selectee by the time of contract award due to distribution statement requirements and information controls. Future GRMs for the Phase III effort would include models provided by SSC and/or SWAC.

Q9 (01/11/2024): What sort of&nbsp;static text-based design documentation will be used for this effort?

What are likely formats of the text-based documentation (e.g., .doc, .xls, .pdf, .jpg, .png)?
A: <p style=""margin-left:8px"">There will be text-based source documentation including MS suite (.docx, .pptx, .xls), .pdf, and/or AFSript (AFSIM scripting language).

Q2 (01/22/2024): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">During the webinars, a question was asked if a company can submit multiple proposals to address&nbsp;different aspects of the topic and the answer given by the TPOC and others was Yes, as long as they meet the criteria set forth in the topic. However, per <strong>section 2.5 of the general BAA Instruction</strong>&nbsp;states: &ldquo;A small business concern may only submit one (1) proposal to each open topic. If more than one proposal from a small business concern is received for a single open topic, only the <b>most recent proposal</b> to be certified and submitted prior to the submission deadline will receive an evaluation. <b>All prior proposals submitted by the small business concern for the same open topic will be marked as nonresponsive and will not receive an evaluation</b>.&rdquo; No other information counters this statement.&nbsp; Can the TPOC or other authority verify that if a company submits more than 1 proposal response for this topic via the DoD DSIP Portal that all submissions will be received and evaluated, or will only the latest proposal submitted via the portal be made available for evaluation?
A: Note that this language applies only to &quot;Open Topic&quot; solicitations. The Digital Spaceport of the Future topic is a conventional topic (often also referred to as a Specific Topic)&nbsp;and carries no restriction on the number of proposals a company may submit unless otherwise stated.&nbsp;

Q3 (01/22/2024): What&nbsp;machine languages are&nbsp;used to transmit the sensor data from the legacy systems?
A: Thank you for your inquiry regarding the machine languages used in our legacy systems for transmitting sensor data. To provide a precise answer, it&#39;s important to clarify the context of your question.&nbsp; Our systems employ a variety of technologies to transmit data from different types of sensors, including radar, telemetry, weather, video, and voice. This data transmission involves converting the information from the sensor&#39;s native format to a format suitable for our communication networks, often involving digital communication protocols. However, the term &#39;machine language&#39; can refer to different aspects. If you are asking about the low-level languages (like binary or assembly) that the processors in these systems understand, this can vary widely depending on the specific legacy system and sensor type. On the other hand, if your question is about the communication protocols used (such as TCP/IP or RS-232), these too can vary based on the system and the type of data being transmitted. RS-232, for example, is a standard for serial communication that includes unique physical interface and signal characteristics. It&#39;s different from the physical Ethernet used for TCP/IP, which is more commonly associated with IP networks. Our approach is to integrate various machine languages and communication protocols effectively, ensuring that any new integration does not degrade our security posture. &nbsp;

Q4 (01/18/2024): Is ATO process a &ldquo;must have&rdquo; deliverable for the proposed software solution&nbsp;before Phase II exit?&nbsp;In other words, Can we plan TRL6 at Phase II exit but leave ATO in post Phase II?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
A: Yes, it is possible to plan for Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL6) at the Phase II exit while scheduling the Authority to Operate (ATO) process for the post-Phase II period. However, it&#39;s important to consider that the likelihood of securing an Interim Authority to Test (IATT) or ATO earlier in the process can significantly enhance the competitiveness of the proposed software solution. Early attainment of these authorizations demonstrates a robust understanding of the required security controls and a proactive approach to risk management, which are key factors in the selection process. Therefore, while not a mandatory deliverable for Phase II exit, achieving IATT or ATO sooner rather than later can be a decisive advantage.

Q5 (01/12/2024): Can you offer a list of legacy systems you are tying to modernize and the functionality they currently serve? Is the USSF willing to replace legacy systems instead of modernizing them?
A: &nbsp;I can give an incomplete answer given it was pointed out that the Spaceports are much more than the legacy Ranges..&nbsp; LTRS is comprised of 11 supersystems: Planning/Scheduling, Communications, Timing/Count, Weather, Area Surveillance (air, sea, rail), Telemetry (tracking/data transmission downlinks), Radar (tracking), Optics (tracking/video), Data Handling (legacy pre and post launch data processing), Range Safety (used to create fight related displays for Flight Controller (human) use), Command (RF system used to transmit Flight Controller commands to vehicles in flight providing positive control). Given age/difficulty sustaining legacy systems- preference would be to replace if affordable/sufficient business case can be made.&nbsp;

Q6 (01/12/2024): Are there specific examples of analog interfaces that should be supported (e.g.&nbsp;RF connectors)? Is there a single common interface used across the ranges for these legacy sensors, or does it vary?
A: Interfaces are what they were when the stovepiped systems were acquired/fielded.&nbsp; Historically the systems utilized point to point landline circuits for communications.&nbsp; An upgrade in the 1990s did force the use of conversion equipment to support a converged Asynchronous Transfer Mode based transport network.&nbsp; A decade long effort is still being worked by RM to provide/field a Juniper based IP transport network.&nbsp; That network also included conversion equipment to create IP traffic for the purpose of point to point transport.&nbsp; LTRS also utilizes SATCOM, Microwave, and DISA acquired circuits for required off base connectivity. As I stated in webinar - the interfaces present today are the interfaces utilized at the time of system acquisition - if you can imagine an interface - it&#39;s probably still in use somewhere on the Ranges today.&nbsp;

Q7 (01/12/2024): As part of the digital transformation effort, does AATS plan&nbsp;on using/implementing the DoD supplied Advana Data Lakehouse as part of the&nbsp;solution?
A: Yes, much of the maintenance data is supplied to BLADE, a tenant of Advana and SLD 30 is leveraging Decision lens in a trail format to conduct portfolio analysis. There is also a lot of joint DLA data we can leverage from Advana.

Q8 (01/11/2024): How can we can have access to the recordings of the AMA sessions?
A: Recordings for all webinars will be uploaded to the AFWERX Challenge website here:&nbsp;https://afwerxchallenge.com/spacewerx26/digital-spaceport-of-the-future/overview

An integrated multi-source PNT capability will be determined to be regionally and/or locally capable if it collectively maintains accurate PNT information over the limited time required by a specific mission and cooperatively provides remote platforms with the best possible realization of Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), in addition of other aids of local atomic clocks, GPS receivers, etc. required over the limited area when global PNT information may not be available. Specifically, regional and/or local PNT sources are those which are available from remote attritable platforms over a limited geographical area or are available at mission-essential levels of precision for a limited time because of phase and frequency offsets, unknown phase jumps, short-term noises, etc. which in turn require recalibration. As potential complements to GPS as part of a resilient integrated PNT architecture, these cooperative remote platforms providing regional and/or local PNT service coverages are enabled by wireless communications and data networks. Very often, all the remote platforms need to have a common Universal Coordinated Time (UCT) reference. Consequently, innovative standards and protocols pertaining to networked time transfer and synchronization for regional and/or local sources of PNT information are necessary. Prospective solutions should consider: i) Complex ad-hoc networks, including tree-structure based, cluster-structure based, and fully distributed; ii) Network synchronization with asynchronous communications with reliability and bandwidth requirements; iii) Two-way time transfers against asymmetric propagation delays, Sagnac effects, and hardware operations; and iv) Convergence rates, robustness, stability, and scalability subject to network sizes and member source qualities.

Solutions should demonstrate the ability to increase power generation from systems utilizing state-of-practice photovoltaic devices.,"Space Systems Command (SSC), located at Los Angeles Air Force Base, is responsible for developing, equipping, fielding, and sustaining lethal and resilient space capabilities for warfighters. Historically, SSC requires each mission block to have 3-5% more power. This is critical for the United States to maintain space dominance over its adversaries. Unfortunately, efficiency improvements in III-V solar cells have begun to plateau and obtaining 3-5% more power due exclusively through cell efficiency gains is becoming increasing unlikely. In order to reach the goals set by SSC, increased power generation must come from non-traditional improvement methods, including advances in cover glass technology. Cover glass is critical to protect solar cells from the harsh environment of space in Earth's orbit. Since it is a necessity to have in the system, finding a way to utilize cover glass beyond just a protective barrier can lead to increased performance in the solar module system. There are several approaches to obtain this goal. First, there has been success in literature in texturing cover glass to improve non-normal incident light transparency. By increasing transparency, more light will reach the solar cell to be converted to useful energy that would otherwise be lost. Second, down-shifting molecules absorb harmful UV photons and convert/reemit them in the visible wavelength. This increases the concentration of useful energy reaching the solar cells while simultaneously decreasing the amount of UV light that can degrade them. Last, there is room for improvement in traditional, chemically applied anti-reflective coatings (ARCs). Wider bandgap, less expensive ARCs is another way to increase the amount of light that reaches the solar cells to increase their total power conversion efficiency. Mitigating losses is becoming crucial to keep up with the demands of the increasing more complex and power-hungry spacecrafts fielded by the U.S. Space Force.",297,1974,1,No,No,No,,"Awardee(s) will demonstrate materials capable of increased throughput of photons with wavelengths relevant for state of art photovoltaics for space assets.

Liquid neon is a near ideal liquid cryogen for this role. It boils at 27.5 K, which is well below liquid nitrogen and, more specifically, below where typical high performance infrared sensors operate, including long wave infrared detectors. Liquid neon also has over 40 times the refrigerant capacity per unit volume than liquid helium.[1] During a detector characterization, these two properties translate into fewer liquid cryogen transfers into the dewar using liquid neon, leaving more time for characterization. This is an absolutely indispensable advantage in the highly unique circumstance of a remote focal plane array radiation tolerance experiment, where access to the radiation source is strictly limited, rarely available and expensive, and the part must be kept cold for over a week at a time.Unfortunately, due to some unusual circumstances, liquid neon is very expensive and difficult to come by. This is because 70% of the neon produced in the world is used in the growing semiconductor chip manufacturing industry, where argon-flourine-neon excimer pulsed lasers are the workhorse source for deep ultraviolet lithography and the ultra-high purity neon (~99.9999%) used in them must be replenished every two weeks. Additionally, neon production occurs mainly as a byproduct of nitrogen generation via cryogenic distillation of air, a technique that happened to be perfected in the Ukraine where grain production requires large amounts of nitrogen for fertilizer. Given the current difficulties in the Ukraine and its diminished production capacity and the growing use of neon in semiconductor manufacturing, the price of liquid neon has risen to roughly $3000/liter, a 600% increase since 2014. Furthermore, there is currently a single domestic distributor of liquid neon, Linde Corp. However, there is a straightforward path to alleviating some of the hardship associated with the use of liquid neon for characterizing focal plane arrays.The technology to recover and liquefy certain gases, such as helium, at the small scale (~25 liters per day) has been commercially available for nearly a decade and has had a major impact on research and medical institutions ability to experiment, or run their instruments, at cryogenic temperatures. For example, Quantum Design North America, located in San Diego, CA, already offers a complete line of helium liquifiers and helium recovery, storage and purification systems, which allows users to recover and liquefy the exhausted helium gas currently being lost from the normal boil off and helium transfers to cryogenic instruments.[2] This technology alleviates the user's dependence on cryogen suppliers and lessens the impact of rising costs and undependable supply, as well as helps preserve a precious natural resource which is vital to scientific research and medical treatment. With some modification, a similar approach can now likely be adopted for the small scale (<10 liters per day) recovery and reliquefication of neon used in scientific research. In fact, reliquefication of exhausted neon gas was already demonstrated at the laboratory scale (~3 liters per day) in the early 1990s, but the technique was never adopted, likely due to cost and availability of liquid neon.[3]",550,3581,1,No,No,No,,"Awardee(s) will perform initial technical feasibility study and develop plans for a system to recover, purify and reliquefy neon gas at the small scale for use in a detector characterization lab, or semiconductor device fa.

Tunability of the material system has shown coverage of the short- to mid-wave infrared wavelength spectrum (2.0 to 8.0 micrometers). Couple the tunability with large area substates (8 inch Silicon) and mature CMOS processing technology; the ingredients for high performance, high manufacturability photodetection are available. As of this year the minority carrier lifetime has been shown to be short (~3 ns) with a high background carrier concentration as a limiter to device performance [1].This recent demonstration of minority carrier lifetime in GeSn/SiGeSn quantum well is significant because the lifetime reflects how long charge excited by incoming infrared radiation can transport in the material before it can no longer be collected by the EO/IR system, i.e. the likelihood that the photon is seen. Long lifetime lead to efficient collection of charge and low dark currents, two key attributes of an efficient, high signal-to-noise image sensor. While other measures of performance are associated with the material's fundamental nature (e.g. mobility, absorption, ect.), lifetime is fundamentally a measure of concentration of defects in the material and thus the lifetime is improved by innovation and advances in material synthesis (i.e. defects add to the background carrier concentration).As discussed in greater detail in Ref.1, the challenge to further improving (Si)GeSn for infrared-sensing applications is that low growth temperatures increase the incorporation of defects and higher growth temperatures significantly inhibit the incorporation of Sn. Increasing the growth temperature shortens the maximum cutoff of the materials as Sn, the element responsible for reducing the bandgap, incorporates less efficiently. The path forward for (Si)GeSn will require either a novel growth approach that enables more effective incorporation of Sn in (Si)GeSn at higher growth temperatures where the background carrier concentration/minority carrier lifetime can be optimized, or a means of passivating defects present in (Si)GeSn alloys grown at lower growth temperatures wither Sn incorporates more efficiently. This topic seeks to evaluate post-growth hydrogenation as a means to passivate defects and improve the background carrier concentration/minority carrier lifetime in low-temperature grown (Si)GeSn alloys. Hydrogenation is commonly used to passivate defects in a multitude of semiconductor materials that suffer from defects. Given that the lifetime has been shown to depend on the growth conditions utilized to synthesize the material, it is possible that the defects introduced at lower growth temperatures can be passivated, leading to lower background carrier concentrations and longer minority carrier lifetimes in (Si)GeSn alloys with sufficient Sn mole fraction to effectively cover the short- to mid-wave infrared spectrum.",433,3018,1,No,No,No,,Awardee(s) will develop a hydrogenation recipe and test plan.

This challenge is even greater in the beyond-GEO region where three-body gravity becomes significant, resulting in the dynamics being more nonlinear. Additionally, the increased distance between an Earth-based sensor and the object reduces the apparent motion between them, resulting in little independent information to initialize an orbit. The initial uncertainties in xGEO orbits are therefore highly non-Gaussian, which inhibits the effectiveness of traditional propagation and filtering methods.

Ongoing improvements in manufacturing processes are also reducing the size and costs of space-capable hardware. Not only is it more economical and feasible to launch platforms into space, but more platforms can be deployed to orbit at a lower cost. These trends, combined with comparable trends in the air domain regarding the commercial proliferation of unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology, suggest that orbital swarms are on the horizon. Swarm-based architectures and operations provide benefits to resiliency and scalability and are synergistically capable of handling some complex tasks beyond what fewer and larger independently-controlled drones may accomplish. These additional benefits come with the need to manage the health and coherency of the swarm, ensure that swarm members do not collide with others in nearby space, and that commands issued to the swarm are effectively communicated to all members. Such challenges are exacerbated as swarms begin operating in the orbital domain.This topic seeks solutions that explore the use of swarm-based architectures in the orbital domain for performing Earth Observation (EO) and Space Domain Awareness (SDA) tasks in support of multi domain operations. Responses are sought that explore the potential for using and orchestrating orbital swarms to observe orbital and/or terrestrial objects through one or more sensor modalities.

A: <ol><li>Integrated solution of a platform and sensor system is preferred. The Government does not have a preferred technology to perform domain awareness and object discrimination.</li><li>Proposed algorithm solutions should also include a platform and sensor solutions. Proposals that include algorithms solutions only are not considered relevant to this topic.</li></ol>

Q2 (06/02/2024): What is the anticipated necessary coverage area for a single sensor? E.g., will 1 sensor cover 1 square mile, 10 square miles, a 20 mile radius, etc?
A: Coverage of each sensor is dependent on the proposed solution to meet a 100 square mile coverage area.

Q3 (06/02/2024): Are there any standards or interfaces that the sensors are expected to have to easily interoperate with other sensors and software platforms?
A: Sensors will need to be able to transported via contractor proposed data link to DoD or Air Force Battle Network for data fusion.

Q4 (06/02/2024): A previous response stated 30 to 60 days is the station keeping requirement for these sensors. Is this to be understood as the overall lifetime of the sensors, or only to be understood as the length of time that the sensors will stay in one location before they are deployed to another location?
A: The Government envisions a 30 to 60 day mission. These assets are highly attributable and not expected to be recovered. Other solutions will be considered.

Q5 (06/02/2024): a) An earlier response states that the data required from the sensors is “Primarily discrimination of maritime and airborne assets."" Can this be interpreted to mean that these sensors are intended to be used to detect, locate, and classify maritime and airborne assets?&nbsp;b) Is there any intent for these sensors to also be used to monitor environmental conditions such as waves and temperature?
A: a. That is correct interpretationb. Environmental conditions are not a primary mission set and not a significant capability for this topic.&nbsp;

Q6 (06/02/2024): Are the sensors expected to collect atmospheric and oceanographic parameters such as sea surface temperature, barometric pressure, wave height, salinity, currents, etc?
A: Environmental conditions are not a primary mission set and not a significant capability for this topic.&nbsp;

Q7 (06/01/2024): Could using a crane or a-frame to deploy from a maritime platform still be considered “easy”? &nbsp;
A: The use of specialized equipment not readily available to maritime or air deployment are not considered easy. Deployment of the sensors should consider the agility to deployment mass quantities of the sensors in a short amount of time.

Q8 (05/31/2024): Is the expectation that every sensor is the same, or will heterogenous networks be considered?
A: Heterogenous networks will be considered.

Q9 (05/31/2024): The topic description mentions “ISR capabilities,"" in addition to oceanographic and atmospheric data, is the expectation that these sensors may collect data using cameras, SDRs, and other types of data?
A: Primary mission of the sensors is domain awareness and object discrimination for 30 to 60 days. The use of cameras, SDRs, and other data types are potential solutions will be considered to provide this capability. Due to the attributable nature of the mission set, cost and quantity to provide this capability will be considered in determining viability.&nbsp;

Q10 (05/31/2024): Are the sensors expected to be attritable, or will they be retrieved?
A: The Government envisions attributable sensors that provide domain awareness and object discrimination for 30 to 60 days. Other solutions will be considered.

Q11 (05/31/2024): The second referenced paper discusses passive-acoustic receivers. Is the expectation that the sensors under this topic will include a passive acoustic sensor?
A: Passive acoustics are one of many solutions that the Government will consider and used for reference only.&nbsp;

Q12 (05/31/2024): The first referenced paper discusses profiling floats, which rise and fall within the water column. Is the expectation for this topic that the floats will be profiling floats, or will other platforms with the ability to sense up to 50m depth be considered?
A: Profiling floats are one of many solutions that the Government will consider and used for reference only.&nbsp;

Q13 (05/31/2024): The keywords in the topic include “mesh sensors,” but mesh networking is not mentioned in the topic description. Is the expectation that these sensors will be mesh-networked?
A: The Government envisions mesh sensors as viable low cost solution utilizing multiple sensors in a mesh framework but this does not eliminate other solutions that do not require mesh capabilities to provide domain awareness.

Q14 (05/31/2024): What is the preferred telemetry for the sensors? E.g., satellite communications vs line-of-sight?
A: The Government sees benefits of either solution and does not want to limit innovative solutions.&nbsp;

Q15 (05/31/2024): What is the anticipated deployment methodology for the sensors? E.g., air-deployed from airplanes, helicopters, drones? Deployed from land and expected to maneuver into place? Deployed from surface vessels?
A: Anticipate deployment via air drop or naval vessel.&nbsp;

Q16 (05/31/2024): Is station-keeping a firm requirement, or will freely drifting sensors be considered?
A: The Government seeks solutions which can monitor a 100 mile square area in shallow waters (up to 100 meters) for 30 to 60 days. The requirement for station keeping is dependent on the proposed solution to maintain domain awareness for this amount of time.

Q17 (05/30/2024): <ol><li>&nbsp;Can you provide a ROM target, or not to exceed amount, as it relates to “Low cost” sensors? &nbsp;$1,000 / $100,000 / $1,000,000?</li><li>&nbsp;What are the station keeping requirements / targets in different conditions (winds, currents)? &nbsp;</li><li>Can you provide examples for the types of atmospheric and maritime research data that are needed?</li><li>What is meant by “small""? &nbsp;should a person be able to pick one up or will larger solutions be considered?</li></ol>

Space-based ISR assets are also limited in number, provide episodic coverage and often focused on higher priority operational tasks beyond domain awareness.

Rocket transport of cargo opens up a new capability by enabling the delivery of goods to any point on the earth within 90 minutes or less. While this capability provides a transformation in cargo transport, many challenges remain in making cargo transport via rocket a reality. A specific focus is how the Government can take advance of commercial capabilities without taking sole ownership or creating a unique aspect that is Government only, thereby driving up life cycle cost. Another aspect of interest to the Government is the ability to influence designs early on so that if there are unique Department of Defense (DoD) requirements, they can be incorporated into the commercial product enabling dual-use aspect. The Department of the Air Force is exploring rocket transportation capability for DoD logistics and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is currently assessing emerging rocket capability across the commercial vendor base, and its potential use for quickly transporting DoD materiel to ports across the globe. The U.S. commercial launch market is building the largest rockets ever, at the lowest prices per pound ever, with second-stages that will reenter the atmosphere and be reused. These advances in the U.S. commercial launch market are presenting the need for assessment and maturation of system-of-systems concepts of rocket transportation for DoD (Department of Defense) logistics by the United States air Force and Space Force (USAF/USSF). A large trade space exists for the potential of rocket cargo for global logistics, to include improvements in delivery cost and speed compared to existing air cargo operations. The goal of this effort is to investigate concepts, and yet to be develop concepts for rock cargo to determine technical feasibility and risk, programmatic costs, and schedule. The information, test and evaluation (T&E) under this effort will be used to influence and guide rocket cargo efforts. While the goal is to enable up to 100 tons of cargo to be delivered anywhere on the planet within tactical timelines, there may be optimization techniques and process with smaller amounts of cargo and transportation modes other than rockets that can provide rapid delivery of materials. An objective of this effort is to grow AFRL's Rocket Cargo industrial base. This topic is intended to reach companies capable of completing a feasibility study and prototype validated concepts under accelerated Phase I and II type schedules. This topic is aimed at later stage research and development efforts rather than &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; or basic research/research and development. The focus is on emerging commercial capabilities to minimize cost and enable agile logistics through the entire span of responsive mission planning, rapid cargo logistics, ground launch operations and coordination with commercial airspace.

A: Specific CONOPS of the solution are left to the proposer.

Q2 (09/18/2024): The Phase II section of the topic description says ""Laboratory prototypes and associated software products will be delivered to the government"", but my understanding is that the topic doesn't involve hardware development. Can you confirm that the expected deliverable is an algorithm, delivered as software, without any custom hardware?
A: While novel hardware development is out of scope, the Phase II solicitation explicitly states:&nbsp;‘Finally, the processing pipeline used to detect, track and fuse will be integrated and run as a laboratory prototype which is identified as well suited for onboard processing. Performers will report tracking performance using annotated data to determine probability of detect and false alarm, sensitivity limits of the final prototype, temporal performance/real time capability and power requirements. Prototypes should utilize surrogate data to demonstrate real time tracking, data fusion and track products.’&nbsp;This indicates the need of some level of laboratory prototype suitable to demonstrate algorithm performance during the Phase II. The form factor of this prototype will depend on the proposed CONOPS to be demonstrated. Laboratory protypes are to be delivered to the government and used as a starting point for field demonstration if a Ph III is awarded.

A: The solution should be suitable for a swap constrained spaceborne platform performing earth observation.

Q6 (09/17/2024): Is it desirable from the Governments point of view to have a data fusion strategy that links frame-based sensing with event-based sensing via a tip &amp; cure approach? In other words, each sensor is on a separate platform, likely at different altitudes? This strategy would not preclude a co-sighted (calibrated) data fusion strategy, where both sensors are on the same platform.
A: The solution should be able to perform detect and track without external tip and cue. This is the focus of the topic.

The resulting research should deliver data fusion algorithms that enable and inform search and track concept of operations while improving track fidelity in the temporal domain using the neuromorphic data and improving target discrimination using traditional imagers.,"Neuromorphic or event-based sensors (EBS) offer an alternative sensing paradigm in which pixels operate asynchronously and only report scene dynamics in the form of (x,y,t,p) messages where x and y are pixel indices, t is a timestamp in microsecond precision and p is a polarity bit to indicate increasing or decreasing changes [1]. The result is a sensor with high temporal resolution in combination with significantly reduced power consumption and overall data reduction as compared to traditional high speed video. The ability to measure fleeting temporal dynamics at reduced power and computational cost has prompted a number of studies in leveraging this sensing technology for applications such as moving target engagement. This then requires methods by which neuromorphic sensing data streams can be integrated with and leveraged alongside traditional sensing modalities. This topic seeks solutions to demonstrate the data fusion of neuromorphic and framing data such that tracking information from framing imagers can be temporally upsampled through the use of event based data streams. Ultimately this should be implemented and deployed in a processing architecture which is well suited for onboard processing hardware which are naturally constrained by size weight and power. Although fused tracking data should be the end product the delivered software product, solutions should also include concept of operations considerations that enable geo-registration, clutter suppression, sensor tip & cue and track handoff.

Are there any additional Phase III considerations that would inform the Phase I approach?
A: Phase III would include analysis of all launch events and expanding its notification functionality. This means extending the software capability to detect, classify, and analyze a wider range of space-related activities, including not only on-orbit events but also all launch events. Furthermore, the notification functionality should be enhanced to provide timely alerts to relevant stakeholders, including USSF operators and other government agencies, about detected launch events and on-orbit activities. The idea is to develop a software capability that can automatically detect and classify on-orbit activities as irresponsible, adversarial, or other. The proposed solution should demonstrate the ability to accurately classify and analyze on-orbit activities based on predefined criteria, such as patterns of behavior and associated threat levels. The feasibility study should assess the scientific and technical merit of the proposed approach, including the feasibility of integrating various data sources such as orbital data, pattern of life assessments, and other open-source datasets.&nbsp;

A: Non-ablative cooling is allowable from our perspective. I can't speak to what arcjet facilities will allow though. As mentioned in the topic, we would want some prior proof of robustness for approaches like transpiration cooling. Also, a key objective mentioned in the call is in getting beyond the performance limits of coated carbon/carbon specifically with regard to coating failure through mechanisms like small erosion sites causing a path for oxidative damage to carbon leading to shape stability loss or delamination of coatings.

Can you also provide whether the arc-jet test will be conducted by SF or will come out of SBIR budget. Last quote we received arc-jet was quite expensive and adds up very quickly for 1 test depending on how long it needs to run. If out of SBIR budget, can you also share how long Arc-Jet needs to last to carve out the correct budget?
A: Hello Clifford, The general dimensions needed for the test article are to be at least about 2 inches long from a point to about 2 inch in diameter circle. There may be interest in a design that is about 2 inches long from a point to a flattened shape at about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high. For the proposal stage, we are open to suggested designs and can discuss revision to the design for specific testing approaches if the proposal moves forward.

A: We would like discussion of how the system could be integrated into USSF ops, to include data certification and system RMF management.&nbsp;We would like the system to be capable of detecting new launch events and providing sufficiently accurate observations to cue other sensors for follow-up. &nbsp;We would like the data to be used as training data for future model development.

Q2 (09/13/2024): When you say low cost, do you have a target in mind? And what scale are we talking about? 10 units, 100, or 1,000? (Scale will influence the cost we are able to achieve).<br>&nbsp;The limitation of telescopes is that while they are lower cost than radar, they’re narrow field meaning they can’t track multiple objects overhead. Would a panoramic telescope capability composed of multiple telescope imagers be of interest to this topic, enabling both lower cost, as well as wide field of view coverage?<br>&nbsp;What field of view would be optimal for this proliferated low-cost system to track objects overhead? For example, 10 degrees, 45 degrees, 120 degrees?<br>&nbsp;Am I correct in assuming that you are looking to detect and track points that represent space debris and cubesats, and not that you want to get sufficient pixels on target to classify them?&nbsp;<br>Towards that end, it may be possible to perform characterization through AI, in observing intensity and motion changes of the tracked points, to determine whether an object is space debris or a cubesat. Is that of interest?<br>What importance does the networking aspect of these sensors have in this application? And what importance does developing edge compute functionality to support that networking capability have in this Phase 2, or do you envision that as more of a Phase 3 activity?
A: Low cost we are targeting around 1M per unit with 5-10 units total.&nbsp;Yes a panoramic telescope capability would be of interest.&nbsp;The desired FOV covers as much of the sky as possible.&nbsp;We are not looking to classify objects, just produce the observation.&nbsp;Characterization via AI may be of interest later on in follow on efforts, but not for this immediate topic.&nbsp;Edge compute functionality will be important for the amount of data being generated. &nbsp;We are less concerned with networking and power aspects.

Q3 (09/12/2024): Are you seeking a ground-based solution when you state objects “passing overhead”, or are you agnostic and open to a space-based solution that can be ""proliferated worldwide""?
A: We are looking at terrestrial solutions only. &nbsp;Thank you.

A: Good Morning - Solutions using visible and/or IR bands would be acceptable, as long as it fits within cost expectations. &nbsp;The limiting magnitude of the system will be based off the optical design - however our objective is to see dimmer objects such as CubeSats. &nbsp;There are no SWaP limitations at this time. &nbsp;The cost range of the system fits within the PhII award amount.",,"Electronics, Sensors",2,Electronics,Microelectronics | Space Technology,Microelectronics | Space Technology,2,Space Domain Awareness; SDA; LEO; Sensing; Autonomous Systems,5,Space Domain Awareness,Yes,1,Yes,,"Low earth orbit spacecraft are typically tracked by radar sites, and infrequently by optical telescopes.

Developed processes shall be capable of purifying materials from sub-quality feedstocks and produce precursor materials with sufficient yields or reduced cost.","Energetic materials are multi-use materials used in private industry, recreational sport, and military applications. Explosives are typically produced at a large-scale, where industrial production facilities range from a couple of pounds to millions of pounds of material each year. Explosives are usually separated by classes (particle granulation sizes) and are produced in accordance with various material specifications that include purity, particle size distributions, and morphology. Since WWII, the US energetics community has relied on a handful of materials as the cornerstones of its explosive arsenal. Combining the high-quality performance metrics of legacy materials, the current existing infrastructure, and their inexpensive production cost, it is logical as to why the energetic community continues to turn to these materials. Despite increases in performance compared to legacy energetic materials, the explosive CL-20 has struggled to mature into practical use in US propulsion technology. Various factors, such as complex synthesis pathways, difficult to source precursor/input materials, demanding reaction conditions, difficult purification methods, or limited infrastructure has limited CL-20's ability to achieve a footing in the US industrial base. As a result, the same fuel sources have continued to be the go-to choice for US propulsion technologies as fuels leveraging modern CL-20 continue to economically fall short of legacy materials, limiting the business case to mature modern materials. To invest in maturing modern propulsion technologies, this proposal seeks possible partners that are able to develop production techniques for yield, purity, morphology control for precursor/input materials of CL-20. Maturation of precursor/input materials will not only affect the overall synthesis of the energetic but will reduce the cost to manufacture CL-20, possibly becoming competitive with legacy propulsion energetics on the large scale. With a more defined, cost effective, and commercially viable production pathway for CL-20 precursors/input materials, the propulsion community may begin to develop novel formulations leveraging this higher performing nitramine material. This topic seeks to fund proposals that can develop robust synthetic routes with reduced production cost of CL-20 precursors and/or input materials.",327,2355,1,No,No,No,,"In the last 40 years, CL-20 has historically been up to 10x the cost of legacy explosives, causing manufacturers to have little desire to mature this chemical into a cornerstone manufacturing material. However, because CL-20 was developed in up to 40 years ago, extensive research and development into its synthesis optimization and various synthesis pathways has been investigated. The precursor/input materials required for synthesis are well known and mature, but few have expanded on optimizing these materials to large-scale production due to their poor economical return at the production scale. However, with a new demand for higher performing nitramines, the economical reason to further mature CL-20 precursor/input materials have taken shape. To capitalize on the increased performance of CL-20, with a known precursor/input material base, a focused effort must be made to further mature their development into large production. As this is a Direct to Phase II (D2P2) SBIR, proposers should provide evidence showing that their technology is mature enough for D2P2. Evidence should stem from previous experimental data generating nitrated precursor/input materials or other high-performance nitramines with a maturity level near ready pilot-scale production.","Develop and demonstrate one or more pilot-scale processes for CL-20 precursor/input material production. Production pathways should exhibit polymorph control (if applicable) and narrow particle size distribution and control along with high purity of precursor/input material generated. Additionally, the process should factor in scalability, limited operator exposure, hazardous waste generation, and show process control measures such as solvent recycling. The process should be applicable to large-scale chemical manufacturing environments and showcase an ability to decease production costs. CL-20 precursor/input materials must be shipped to a DoD customer lab for further evaluation of product quality. Phase 2 deliverables will mature precursor/input material synthesis to a technology readiness level of 4-5, demonstrating the ability to manufacture prototype material in a production relevant environment. The phase will conclude with a full technical data package and transition plan that documents synthetic procedures and achieves consistent reproducibility and cost reduction over current industry processes.","One or more of the processes developed in Phase 2 should be transitioned and scaled to production capacity. These processes will demonstrate the ability to control purity, polymorph (if applicable), and particle size distributions of the precursor/input materials chosen. The precursor/input material should also be taken through the rest of the synthesis pathway to demonstrate the ability to produce energetic materials. The input material process from Phase III should be scalable and transition-able to integrate into full-rate chemical production plants. The processes delivered will diminish the production risk and manufacturing cost to meet potential energetic or propellant production surge demand.

A: A1. No. Target detection, tracking, and classification algorithms should be added outside of the readout integrated circuit (ROIC) and preferably outside of the dewar. They are therefore out of scope for this effort.&nbsp;A2. No. Image fusion algorithms should be added outside of the ROIC and preferably outside of the dewar. They are therefore out of scope for this effort.&nbsp;A3. Possibly. While non-uniformity correction (NUC) can be handled outside of the dewar, it might be reasonable to have pixel level control over certain circuits in order to improve NUC performance. This functionality could require additional signal processing capabilities in the unit cell and on-chip.

Q2 (09/24/2024): <ol><li>Regarding the radiation hardening requirement – what orbit(s) are assumed?</li><li>Regarding the Latch-up, SEU, and TID, what levels should we work towards?</li></ol>
A: A1. &nbsp;The primary goal of this effort is to have an event-based ROIC capable of supporting a low earth orbit infrared event-based camera demonstration. The longer term goal is to have a ROIC that can scale to larger formats for higher orbits with minimal modification to the circuitry. Operation through harsher radiation environments (e.g. South Atlantic Anomaly) is desired, but not necessarily required.&nbsp;&nbsp;A2: Please work towards cross sections of 1E-7 per sq. cm at cryogenic temperatures and TID of 100kRad (Si).

Q3 (09/24/2024): <ol><li>There is a framing requirement, but it does state the required frame rate. Is 60 Hz acceptable or are you looking for a faster frame rate?</li></ol>
A: There is no fixed frame rate requirement in order to allow proposals to trade&nbsp;between different performance metrics (e.g. radiation hardness, dynamic range,&nbsp;readout noise). However, the integrating mode must be useful. As such, frame&nbsp;rates of 30-60 Hz are anticipated, although lower frame rates are acceptable&nbsp;if other performance metrics improve.

A: A1. The minimum prototype is a ROIC, although FPAs and/or cameras would be considered responsive.&nbsp;&nbsp;A2. &nbsp;At minimum, the final packaged system is a set of ROIC die, at least one of which has been validated in a laboratory environment. Effectively, this means that the ROIC must operate in a cryogenic environment (60-240 K) and meets the static power dissipation requirements. A full focal plane array (FPA) with hybridized detector material is not required. Built-in tests, FPA demonstrations, and camera demonstrations would exceed the minimum requirements, but are considered responsive. Preference would also be given to performers who can identify good die from bad.&nbsp;A3. The proposer should demonstrate that they meet as many of the requirements as possible using a bare ROIC die - not a full FPA - at the end of the program. Cryogenic operation, static power dissipation, and array format/pitch are all testable at the ROIC level.&nbsp;",,"Sensors, Space Platforms",2,Sensors,Integrated Sensing and Cyber | Space Technology,Integrated Sensing and Cyber | Space Technology,2,Event Based Sensor; neuromorphic imaging; ROIC; Infrared; read out integrated circuit design; focal plane array design; FPA,7,Event Based Sensor,Yes,1,Yes,,"This topic seeks to develop a radiation hardened Event-Based Sensor (EBS) readout integrated circuit (ROIC) with small pixel pitch, large format, and the ability to hybridize to commonly available infrared detector material.",32,"This topic seeks to develop a radiation hardened Event-Based Sensor (EBS) readout integrated circuit (ROIC) with small pixel pitch, large format, and the ability to hybridize to commonly available infrared detector material.","Infrared EBS may offer many advantageous capabilities to Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Many tracking applications produce extremely high data rates (>10 GBps) that could be drastically reduced using a properly designed infrared EBS. An EBS accomplishes this goal by asynchronously recording data when a change in the pixel irradiance is detected. An EBS ROIC design could also enable reduced background data generation rates with novel design choices. The scope of this project is to design a prototype EBS ROIC demonstrating a signal-integrating unit cell, lower data rates, and downstream asynchronous handshake logic to provide actionable information on scene movement. This design will be optimized for Air Force needs and will be directly compared to a standard framing ROIC to provide a deeper understanding of the image scene and motion detection algorithms. The key optimization parameters are as follows. The pixel unit size shall be 30 um or smaller, with a desire for options at 10 um and 20 um to match existing optics. The array format shall be 320 x 256 or larger for demonstration purposes, with the ability to scale to 2 MPixel arrays or larger. All three infrared bands (i.e. 1-1.7 um, 3-5 um, and 8-12 um) shall be usable under this design, including both p-on-n and n-on-p designs. To support all of these designs, the ROIC operating temperature shall be 60 &ndash; 240 K. The ROIC shall be radiation-hardened for latch-up, single event upset, and total ionizing dose. The ROIC shall also have an integrating mode to compare with its EBS mode. EBS-specific parameters include the latency, timing accuracy, event rate, and power consumption. The pixel latency shall be less than 10 microseconds and the timing accuracy shall be 10x better (i.e. 1 microsecond). The ROIC shall support event streams of 109 events per second or greater, with a static scene power consumption of 10 mW and a dynamic scene power consumption of 100 mW.

Advancements in technology to detumble a client satellite or RSO and perform safe operations for prepared and unprepared space objects. Explore novel methodologies for stabilizing and detumbling client satellites in orbit.

Solution must be able to integrate with existing workflows through open API that can be leveraged with existing systems and meets development and operational environment requirements.,"Direct Ascent Anti-Satellite (DA-ASAT) launches pose a significant risk because of the destructive potential they possess. A single DA-ASAT event can cripple ground-based capabilities and cause on-orbit debris that presents further risk to space systems operations. The ability quickly and accurately identify DA-ASAT launch events provides a particular strategic advantage allowing for an increased response time and reducing the element of surprise that would be prevalent in the event of a connecting DA-ASAT launch. While there are manual processes in place to identify and alert of DA-ASAT launches and associated likelihoods, they are labor intensive and there is an inherent risk of an event being overlooked given the magnitude of launch events and large number of variables. A normal space launch carrying satellites is not very different from a DA-ASAT launch except that DA-ASATs impact a target around the time they achieve orbit. Since the goal is impact another satellite, the velocities and trajectories of DA-ASATs will differ from peaceful launches. Leveraging data sources such as two-line elements (TLEs), state vectors, or other similar information available through satellite orbit catalogs, data science methods such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced statistical modeling, or other methods can be used to produce insightful information. Space Systems Command (SSC) Space Domain Awareness (SDA) Tap Lab is seeking solutions to provide a software capability that can automatically assess and analyze launch events in real-time (or near-real time as possible) and classify launch events as DA-ASAT launch events while also identifying targeted satellites if applicable. There are four key deliverables that the solution must provide. 1) Probabilistic inference classifying the launch event as either a DA-ASAT launch or not If the event is determined to be a DA-ASAT launch, then the following deliverables are required:2) List of targeted satellites with associated probability risk scores3) Time to impact or time to explosion of DA-ASAT4) Calculated anticipated miss distanceThe software product must be able to be integrated into existing toolchains that are used by USSF operators and the SDA Tap Lab. As this capability is only one specific functionality to be used in conjunction with other tools to provide a wholistic understanding of space domain awareness and space operations, it is pivotal that the solution be able to seamless integrate with existing systems through API call. The solution must also meet all development and operational requirements for system integration and use on classified systems.Potential data sources to leveraged for development of this topic can include but are not limited to:- Public catalog of orbits via space-track.org and European Space Agency- Commercially available orbits via Unified Data Library (UDL)- Publicly available orbits via amateurs and hobbiyists- Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs)- Multi-source and publicly available contextual information (news feed, blogs, social media)",453,3067,1,No,No,No,,"This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II.

Phase II builds upon the Phase I feasibility study, demonstrating scientific and technical merit, validating product-mission fit, and defining an actionable plan for collaboration with Air Force and/or Space Force stakeholders.","Phase III of the project aims to scale the finalized model developed in Phase II to encompass the analysis of all launch events, not limited to just DA-ASAT launches. This expansion broadens the scope of the solution to provide comprehensive launch event analysis, thereby enhancing space domain awareness and operational readiness.

This could involve the development of advanced notification systems capable of disseminating critical information to relevant stakeholders in real-time or near-real-time, enabling prompt decision-making and response. Furthermore, Phase III may involve the integration of additional data sources and analytical techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of launch event analysis and notification capabilities. Collaboration with key stakeholders, including the Air Force, Space Force, and other governmental agencies, will be essential to ensure alignment with operational requirements and maximize the utility of the solution.

The speed of notification plays a large role in tipping and queuing sensors which leads to early tracking ability of the newly launched vehicle. A space launch starts when the main engine of a space launch vehicle ignites. This activity is typically easy to detect by space-based infrared (IR) sensors and serves as the DoD's primary mechanism to detect launches. The orbit of the launch vehicle is then published to public websites typically within a few hours of launch. Once that information becomes public, commercial sensors can then be tasked to track the launch. Having advanced and/or real-time knowledge of when a launch occurs can enable a commercial sensor to search and track the launch vehicle at a much faster rate than currently happening.

As space operations continue to grow in demand and variability, there are novel methods used to gain tactical and strategic advantages. The ability to operate and/or maneuver a satellite without detection provides an advantageous posturing for the satellite owner and can be a sign of on-orbit activity that could present value to US space operations.

In both cases, there will be a monetary cost and possible mission delays associated with the change(s). Increases in cost or changes to schedule can be even more deleterious for missions intended for GEO, which can already be difficult for small rideshare payloads to reach. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) needs a demonstrated capability that can overcome both manifest and GEO-access issues. This capability would enable responsive manifesting/de-manifesting of payloads on the ground without penalties to cost or schedule. Furthermore, this capability would reduce the interface between any rideshares and the primary mission to a non-unique, standardized interface. Once on orbit, the capability would demonstrate the ability to host and maintain the health of payloads in GEO independent of the primary mission for, potentially, multiple years until the payload is needed to respond to a threat and the capability responsively deploys it.",185,1253,1,No,No,No,,"This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II.

Thus, this effort seeks to accelerate technology developments that lead to a new class of high delta V, responsive, rapid transfer Orbit Transfer Vehicles (OTVs) that will meet military needs.","Tactical High Orbit Fast Transfer (THOFT) is the ability to rapidly respond to needs on High-Orbital Energy orbits on operationally relevant timelines. As evidenced by the investments and numerous deployments of capabilities placed on orbit by actors within the Global Power Competition, Space is a dynamic domain. Before, up to, and during a conflict, space capabilities rely heavily upon U.S. space assets.The capability deficiency and current mission impact within the realm of space operations for the Department of Defense (DoD) stems from a lack of rapid response capability to respond to emerging threats. This is emphasized where response is needed to beyond LEO orbits where small launch vehicles cannot reach and rideshares often do not target. Current systems have extended response times, ranging from months to years, which renders them unable to effectively counter adversarial action or respond to threats. Inflexibility in current mission planning processes also hampers the DoD’s ability to adapt to dynamic situation in space.Our mission is to reduce United States Space Force (USSF) response times to events and situations in beyond LEO regions from months or years to hours or days. Thus, having a significant impact on U.S. and ally resilience. To meet the Target Performance Goals, a new class of Orbit Transfer Vehicles (OTVs) will need to be developed to demonstrate the ability to reach all regions of the space domain, including high energy orbits (GEO, Cislunar, MEO, etc.) in effectual, operationally-relevant timelines. This involves emplacement of a small spacecraft into a beyond-LEO orbit within hours. Transported via advanced propulsion systems to get to the necessary orbits, and on-orbit operational procedures to include end- of-life disposal. This OTV will exploit proven spacecraft secondary systems that can be implemented with minimal non-recurring engineering, thus allowing greater focus on the technologies that enable the orbital transfer itself (e.g. lightweight structure, propulsion, etc.). The USSF encourages respondents to this topic to enhance future OTV capabilities to offer technological solutions for full prototype OTV development to meet this need, or demonstration of key enabling technology, as well as integration and full ground demonstration of developed technology solutions.AREAS OF EMPHASIS1) Space Vehicle propulsion:• Propulsive systems to provide for High performance mission capability demands to attain a target Delta Vee above 3000 m/s (notional ESPA class vehicle). Similarly, retaining propulsive flexibility; i.e. the ability for orbital adjustment and mission flexibility will demand Multiple re-start capability• Interest in propellants that are easier to handle/more efficient and quicker to fuel for reduced ground operations. In the case of bi-propellant systems a non-toxic configuration must suffice. All while retaining the ability for storage of short on-orbit mission lifetime (Hours & days with potential expansion to weeks or months with further technology development). This may incur on-orbit cryogenic propellant storage to a degree.• Responsiveness and ground operations will further require non-toxic propellants for secondary propulsion or Attitude Control systems.2) Platform enhancement (structure/subsystems):• Structural, or secondary systems that will affect the dry mass of the system. These may include structure, propellant tanks, secondary components, power systems, etc. Overall impact must be demonstrated at an integrated or rolled up level to address secondary impacts on other subsystems.• Architecture envisions an easily packaged and deployable solution that accommodate either a single stack (Fits within a small launch vehicle payload fairing with accommodation for an ESPA class spacecraft) or integration into a multi-manifested ride- share mission. Hence compact packaging technologies will further.• Rapid transition to an operational system, with viable production rate and surge capability. This infers the leverage/use of active commercial space bus, Orbital Transfer Vehicle or other spacecraft production lines now in development but may need to be modified or enhanced to reduce structural mass, etc.3) Subsystems: Subsystems may need to be addressed, since they do play a role in determining viability of an overall system, but are deemed to be secondary in nature to the focus of this topic.

Or, can it be a prototype of a subcomponent of the system, such as the power supply system or unique modular structural elements?
A: The prototype is preferred to be a functioning system. &nbsp;A modular structural element, or component of a system, would have to be a sensor-based application of some type, as this topic call is requesting a capability increase for space domain awareness. &nbsp;I am not sure how a subcomponent could be adjudicated from a performance standpoint at this time.

Q2 (09/26/2024): Are software-based solutions that enhance space domain awareness through existing ground-based and on-orbit imaging hardware within the scope of this RFP? Specifically, we propose leveraging current ground electro-optical, spectral and visible/non-visible waveform capabilities for material classification, &nbsp;condition monitoring and threat detection without requiring new imaging hardware. Is this type of approach aligned with your goals?
A: An approach utilizing existing ground-based and on-orbit imaging hardware would not be out of bounds; however, I do not envision an expansion of current SDA capability in areas not currently visible or sensible with current assets in theater. &nbsp;This topic call is looking for potential opportunities to expand sensor capability and presence, preferably in areas not currently available or that are currently contested, perhaps. &nbsp;Which would, by design, mean current capabilities cannot necessarily be used for detection because of its lack of presence and availability.

Q3 (09/20/2024): <p style=""margin-left:0px;"">Regarding the topic we would like to inquire about the potential application of a <strong>software-based solution</strong>. Specifically, can a software technology that <strong>enhances space domain awareness by mapping assets in space using existing on-orbit hardware be considered within the scope of this RFP</strong>? This solution would not require any additional hardware deployment, but instead <strong>leverages current space infrastructure to improve the situational awareness and management of assets.</strong> <strong><u>Is this type of approach aligned with the goals of this RFP, given that it focuses on software rather than hardware development?</u></strong><p style=""margin-left:0px;""><strong><u>Thank you!</u></strong>
A: Ideally, a software-based approach is not the intended thrust of this topic call. &nbsp;On-orbit hardware is limited, as is additional availability to asset map. &nbsp;The intent is to develop deployable sensors to augment current day SDA capability in theater.

Q4 (09/20/2024): Is it a requirement to develop a ground-based, ocean-based, or high-altitude platform, or can we utilize existing infrastructure owned by Space Force?<br>Thank you
A: There is no existing infrastructure in the areas under consideration. &nbsp;Hence, a deployable capability.

Q5 (09/10/2024): In relation to the Expeditionary Space Domain Awareness (ExSDA) project’s goal of establishing a comprehensive system for monitoring and safeguarding space activities, I would like to inquire if a software-based solution that enhances space domain awareness by mapping assets in space using existing on-orbit hardware would be acceptable. This solution would leverage current assets and infrastructure in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and beyond, without requiring additional hardware deployment. The software would provide enhanced situational awareness and threat detection, aligning with the project’s focus on resilience, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. Would this approach be considered within the scope of the ExSDA project, given that it focuses exclusively on software rather than new hardware development?
A: This software approach would potentially be acceptable as a thread of source data, sure; however, please understand that the Space Force's current mission area approach for Space Domain Awareness is essentially, in its basest of forms, broken down into “look up” capabilities and “look down/sideways/up from higher” capabilities. &nbsp;The 15th Space Surveillance Squadron, under Delta 2, focuses almost exclusively on the former performance area with our ground electro-optical and visible/non-visible waveform capabilities. &nbsp;If space based capability is proposed, it would not fall under 15 SPSS and Delta 2's purview. &nbsp;Thus, from a conservatively speaking perspective, and in my personal opinion only, I do not think a space based software solution would necessarily fall under this topic call's line(s) of effort.

Q6 (09/10/2024): <ol><li>Could you provide examples of <span style=""background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgba(0,0,0,0.87);"">changes, patterns, and anomaly events of interest?</span></li><li>&nbsp;For d<span style=""background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgba(0,0,0,0.87);"">ata processing and analytics, is edge (e.g., on-orbit) or cloud processing preferred?</span></li></ol>
A: With respect to #1, consider unscheduled maneuvers, both intended and unintended; closely spaced object (CSO) detection, geonatal events (my made up term for something giving birth to something else); uncorrelated track (UCT) and conjunction indications and warnings.&nbsp;With respect to #2, edge processing would be an amenable approach. &nbsp;Considering that the intent of this effort is to notionally deploy SDA capability (sensor, platform) into potentially contested area(s), and considering these capabilities will be operated remotely, and also considering that data throughput may be through “soda straw” like comms paths, it would be prudent to do as much processing and analytics as possible at the edge (terrestrially, airborne, or maritime based vice on-orbit). &nbsp;Sending raw data at (notionally) 5-6TB a day would most likely not be feasible.

Q7 (09/04/2024): Can you please confirm that a satellite platform is part of the solution space for this topic?
A: Satellite platforms are not part of the solution space for this topic, primarily because the sensor and data paths align under a different Delta and a different mission area than what 15 SPSS and Delta 2 currently have aegis over.",,Space Platforms,1,Space Platforms,Space Technology,Space Technology,1,Space domain awareness; Continuous monitoring; Sensor integration; Command and control; Data processing; Interoperability; Resilience; Cost-effectiveness; International collaboration; Training; Sustainability; Anomaly detection; Pattern analysis; Decision support; Space security,15,Space domain awareness,Yes,1,Yes,,"The end goal of the Expeditionary Space Domain Awareness (ExSDA) project is to establish a comprehensive system for monitoring and safeguarding activities in space.

Your guidance would be greatly appreciated as we prepare our proposal.<br>&nbsp;2. Scope of Space Domain Movement: The component-specific solicitation outlines that proposals should ""facilitate movement within the space domain across all orbital regimes, including travel to and from the moon."" Does this objective extend to activities <strong>on</strong> the moon as well, such as establishing lunar cryopropellant depots <u>on the lunar surface</u>, or is it strictly limited to orbital <u>systems</u>?
A: While the current scope of Maneuver requirements are limited to orbital systems, future scope will include Maneuver requirements in cislunar and lunar surface extensions.",,Space Platforms,1,Space Platforms,Space Technology,Space Technology,1,Sustained Space Maneuver (SSM); Orbital Operations; NextGen Warfare; Maneuverability; Strategic Superiority,5,Sustained Space Maneuver (SSM),Yes,1,Yes,,"The end state of this project is to establish a robust and sustainable framework for Space Sustainment and Maneuver, enabling companies to facilitate movement within the space domain across all orbital regimes, including travel to and from the moon.

There is an evolving threat landscape, and our current assets were designed for a past era of competition. The United States Space Force (USSF) requires the ability to relocate our assets from contested areas to positions where they can be part of the solution, as our conflicts will be dynamic, and our adversaries will also adapt. These abilities to maneuver assets are strategic and focused on deterrence. By maximizing our current capabilities and reconstituting them elsewhere, we enhance our sustained space maneuverability, which allows us to position our forces optimally to achieve mission objectives, deter adversaries by gaining a first-mover advantage, negotiate from a position of strength, and generate flexible combat power across all domains. This approach also reduces the burden of reconstituting our orbital capabilities. Enabling this strategy requires augmented training to reflect combat conditions, policies to provide greater freedom of maneuverability, space domain awareness, modernized communication infrastructure, optimized space operator performance, and commercial support for on-orbit servicing.OBJECTIVES 1) Develop a broad range of capabilities and core competencies, to include responsive mobility, refueling, modularity, and autonomous technologies that help provide an asymmetric advantage in our ability to protect, defend and sustain space assets. 2) Capitalize and develop both the “Movement” part of this equation and the “effects” that can be delivered (and negated/warded against).Based on internal knowledge and market research conducted with industry and academia, USSPACECOM has identified an initial set of focus areas to bring structure to the crowdsourcing process for this Challenge. Please see below for details, including desired capabilities and relevant technologies for each focus area. CONTEXTThe Sustained Space Maneuver Challenge is essential because while we hope to avoid conflict in space, we must be prepared for the possibility. Current space assets were not designed nor are they flexible enough to address today's threats effectively, as USSPACECOM indicated. To counteract these challenges, it is vital to strategically relocate and sustain our assets to deter our adversaries. This strategy enhances our ability to position forces flexibly and deny adversaries first-mover advantages. It also reduces the burden of reconstituting our orbital capabilities and maximizes our combat power across multiple domains. However, achieving these goals involves overcoming significant hurdles, such as inadequate training practices, competing priorities, and outdated communication infrastructures. Moreover, operators have insufficient space domain awareness and high cognitive demands. Additionally, reliance on commercial support for on-orbit servicing remains uncertain, further complicating our ability to maneuver freely in space.FOCUS AREAS:1) Maneuver: Support sustained maneuver by optimizing spacecraft mobility and autonomous/semi-autonomous decision making for survivability and maneuver without regret.○ Key Capabilities ■ Software architecture: parameter procurement/reactive maneuver ■ Novel and versatile propulsion systems for enhanced mobility■ Autonomy of on-orbit decision-making■ Modularity via split payload and propulsion■ Moving large high-value assets○ Enabling Technologies of Interest: ■ Methods for validation and verification of autonomous decision-making such as training datasets and data fusion■ Suite of space situational awareness integrated sensors and associated algorithms for collision avoidance maneuvers for objects in close proximity■ Autonomous guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for in-space navigation■ Multi-mode propulsion system consisting of classical mono-prop or bi-prop systems in combination with electric propulsion systems■ Novel designs for integrated power processing unit (PPU) for multi-mode propulsion system■ Novel technology advancements allowing for propulsion subsystem reconfigurable modular design including fuel pumps, tanks, connectors, thrusters, and valves■ Design and manufacture standardized, adaptable connectors capable of concurrently transmitting fluids, gases, power and data between modules assembled in space■ P/L to Bus interface must be operable by low cost, simple robotic arms, and end effectors2) Space Domain Awareness (SDA): SDA data needs to be accomplished when we need and where we need it - timely, relevant, accurate, and actionable.

Future technologies such as clocks for ""5G"" networks and future Global Navigation Satellite System architectures could potentially incorporate more advanced clocks. Optical clocks such as the rubidium two-photon clock offers potential improvements over current chip scale clocks and surpass rubidium atomic frequency references [2]. One limiting factor in future, more advanced optical clocks is the development of the needed laser technology. Optical clocks require narrow linewidths down to kHz linewidths for the rubidium two photon optical clock, or even more narrow for other optical clocks such as strontium. These devices must be optically isolated to ensure the narrow linewidth and to avoid reflections causing unwanted lasing modes. Current systems typically employ a series of free space or fiber coupled components to achieve narrow linewidths and high optical power [2], but they can be susceptible to vibrations and shock. Furthermore, these systems typically have optical isolators with large magnetic fields, limiting the compactness of the device due to the effect of the magnetic field on the atoms. Recently, there have been advancements in each individual area such as narrow linewidth lasers [3, 4], on-chip non-magnetic isolators [5, 6], and new integration techniques [7]. The creation of such a device will not only enhance the manufacturability of the clock and lower the overall size, weight, and power, but it will also increase the environmental robustness to effects such as shock and vibration [8]. However, these devices have not been integrated into a single photonically integrated package.

Also no mathematical symbols. 4 To design and fabricate a multiplexing multispectral filter array covering the visible wavelengths that achieves a higher optical throughput than a narrowband array with equivalent bandwidth and spectral resolution. Current visible-wavelength multispectral filter array technologies suffer from low light throughput because every pixel on the sensor only measures a single wavelength at a single spatial location. Multiple pixels are then considered together to construct the spectral signature over that group of pixels. This approach, while intuitive, leads to low light levels as the spectral resolution increases, since each pixel sees an ever-smaller piece of the object spectrum. The result of this is that high spectral resolution hyperspectral video becomes difficult due to the high integration times necessary to measure the signal. To resolve this issue, the performer will design and fabricate a visible-wavelength multiplexing multispectral filter array, where each filter is sensitive to many wavelengths at once. The performer will then mount their fabricated array onto an off-the-shelf monochromatic camera and demonstrate scene sampling and demosaicking.

A: Not that I know of.&nbsp; We are looking to experiment to test the hypothesis that this type of information presentation would be useful&nbsp;

Q3 (01/10/2024): What kind of exercise/wargame support do you anticipate?&nbsp;
A: Because infrastructure systems run real world all the time, I anticipate that the exercising/wargaming can take place by incorporating the insights we get into real world decisions.&nbsp; Also, since we are looking for something that can do a &ldquo;what if&rdquo; analysis, we as the users should be able to come up with both realistic and possible boundary value type scenarios to assess the perceived validity of the model.&nbsp;

Q4 (01/10/2024): Step 1 references that the goal is ultimately to support space operations. When we say infrastructure, is that intended to be primarily for the purposes of building maintenance and planning? How will the actual focus on space operations come into play? Is there an expectation of a digital twin of satellite control stations at the SF Station?
A: In this case, we are looking for a twin of the facility and infrastructure systems that support space operations.&nbsp; We will not look for a twin of the consoles or other equipment and they will largely be regarded as consumers of power and generators of heat.&nbsp; Facilities and their systems, most directly power and HVAC, are absolutely foundational to the continued viability of the Space Enterprise Ground Segment, so modelling of these systems directly supports space operations.

Observational evidence of spacecraft anomalies is manifested in multiple data types to include raw EO/IR imagery features, astrometric and photometric features, and features associated with their radio-frequency/RF payload. When this data is collected in great volume, from multiple modalities, and geographic locations, there is significant opportunity to enable reliable automated alerting. Today defining normal operations in space so that abnormal behavior can be flagged and more deeply observed is an area of research which addresses fundamental developments required to begin to define a baseline for real-time automated alerting for increasingly crowded orbit neighborhoods, as well as inform how this baseline may be extended to support missions in orbits beyond GEO. This is a significant need as new activities in cislunar space are planned for the coming years. This topic seeks to:1) Define data-driven methods to drive the development and testing of an ontology of automated alerts in support of government and commercial applications and 2) Develop foundational mathematical solutions needed to enable these mappings on multiple timescales and to properly quantify the uncertainty in these mappings to effectively support decision making. This includes mapping high frequency and geometrically diverse collection data to: a) Specify/classify maneuver alerts as station-keeping or not, b) Specify observed anomaly types and classify them on the basis of astrometric, photometric and RF features observed, and c.) Quantify confidence/uncertainty in the mapping from input data to selected alerts.

They can penetrate satellite surfaces and deposit their charge into or near the interior electronics, which can lead to damaging discharges. With the recent National Defense Strategy's emphasis on resilient satellites, it is important to develop specification and forecast capabilities that can provide good estimates of the current and near future radiation belt threat levels to allow decision makers the best knowledge of the environment when planning upcoming operations. A knowledge of the environment also allows satellite operators the ability to quickly determine the probability of space environment contributions to anomalies, and more readily ascertain the possibility of pacing competitor ""gray zone"" activities that could lead to satellite malfunctions. Current operational specification and forecast models such as the Spacecraft Environmental Anomalies Expert System &ndash; Real time (SEAESRT) and the Relativistic Electron Forecast Model used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Space Weather Prediction Center (NOAA/SWPC) only address geosynchronous orbit. Current science addresses the full outer-zone electron radiation belts, and should be able to significantly improve upon the existing capability. Some example 3D radiation belt models are the AFRL model [1], Dynamic Radiation Environment Assimilation Model (DREAM) [2], the British Antarctic Survey Radiation Belt Model [3] and others. For forecasting there are current efforts from simple approaches such as The Satellite Risk Prediction and Radiation Forecast System (SaRIF), to sophisticated efforts like SafeSpace model [5].This is a call for new capabilities that can specify and forecast the energetic electron fluxes in the outer-zone for up to 7 days. These nowcasts and forecasts should include the probabilities of different flux levels at locations within the region and the confidence level of each probability. These fluxes will be used to drive a hazard specification capability.",322,2234,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate a capability that can accurately specify hazardous radiation belt fluxes for energies in the range from 0.75 to 6 MeV and >2MeV using operational data. 1. The fluxes must be specified throughout the outer radiation belt zone using accuracy and bias metrics which will be provided and for periods of time which will be specified. 2. There will also be a demonstration that the capability can make accurate 24 and 48 hour forecasts of the same fluxes throughout the radiation belts with acceptable probabilities and confidence levels, using the provided metrics.AFRL will specify the observations to be used for the truth data.","Phase II will have X objectives: 1. Demonstrate that the performance in Phase I can be obtained with a real-time model that only uses operational data.2. The specification will be demonstrated for a more significant time period, as will the original forecast. 3. The forecast with probabilities and confidence levels will be extended to 7 days, we will look for a reasonable fall-off in accuracy with time.4. The capability will be compared with a model being developed by a partner.AFRL will specify the observations to be used for the truth data.If the results are satisfactory, we will recommend this model to our customers, who will be following the effort, for a phase III transition.","The phased III will have as objectives:1. Further validation of the model to provide our customer with a more complete understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.2. Where time and resources permit, there may be further upgrades to the model based on the previous validation results.3. The main effort in phase III will be to produce an Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document and provide support to the team transitioning the capability to operations.",1,"* 1. *Reference 1. Albert, J.

This is repeated in the answer to the previous question 5 with respect to run-time assurance methods avoiding the crux of the issue. For purposes of this proposal, what would be considered a run-time assurance method? For example, would control barrier functions and the like fall under this category? Examples would be helpful.
A: This topic is concerned with developing RL control systems with guarantees, not developing control systems with guarantees that may have an RL-based subcomponent. &nbsp;My mention of run-time assurance is generally applicable to anything that is not ML/RL-based or data-trained.&nbsp;For example, suppose you are training a deep reinforcement learning controller (perhaps some multi-layer ANN). You find through test, validation, or analysis that this alone does not have stability or safety guarantees and appears to possess corner cases or hallucinations which you cannot completely characterize beforehand. If &nbsp;incorporating a non-RL/non-data-trained outer loop, or component, or filter, etc. (such as a CBF) is to “help” the ANN from driving the system into a constraint, then while the system as a whole may be safe, the fact remains the ANN (the RL controller) does not have guarantees and if it is unsafe, this was not able to be characterized completely beforehand. This solution would therefore be irrelevant to this topic. The relevant solution in this example would include a way to end up with the ANN possessing the necessary guarantees for the system without incorporating other items, such as a CBF, in order to bring guarantees into the closed-loop system.&nbsp;On the other hand, if you are utilizing RL or generically data-trained techniques to create a control barrier function and you were able to prove it indeed has typical CBF properties/guarantees, then this would be relevant.

Q2 (05/17/2024): <p style=""margin-left:0px;"">- Are you interested in attitude only control (operating in the same orbit) or proximity operations and changing orbits?<p style=""margin-left:0px;"">- I would appreciate it if you provided more information about the types of satellites and the applications you have in mind.

Are you looking for an algorithm that is hardware- and platform agnostic, and then uses RL to learn new conditions as needed?<p style=""margin-left:0px;"">- The learning process needs resources and can be time-consuming; it might be challenging to do that in orbit. A rapid learning process is needed because of constraints (dynamics, fuel, environment, etc.). Do you have more insight about the constraints that we should consider? Are there any specific SWaP limitations that we need to know about? &nbsp;<p style=""margin-left:0px;"">- For this applications, RL should operate with a minimum / limited amount of data, as it is difficult / impractical and expensive to collect extensive data. &nbsp;Are you going to provide us with more insight into this aspect? Are you going to provide us with real-world data that might be useful for this research?<p style=""margin-left:0px;"">- What do you expect to be delivered by the end of Phase I? do you expect the proposers mostly to provide theoretical developments? Do you expect any specific level of testing and evaluation for the proposed approach by the end of Phase I? Software-level/simulation level validation or experimental / hardware level validation? &nbsp;
A: Hi Mehrdad,&nbsp;<ol><li>The interest is to develop RL techniques, requirements, and theorems that allow data-trained controllers to come with guarantees similar to traditional controllers. There is no preference to the specific application. It could be the case that the theorems developed drive what applications/constraints it applies to. For example, attitude control is a good use case, but in RPO applications where CWH assumptions apply, the translational dynamics become linear and could lead to a more thorough development of RL techniques with guarantees.</li><li>Similar to #1.</li><li>Reinforcement Learning is used loosely here. This topic is concerned with data-trained models built to act as control systems. My suggestion would be not to limit yourself to what existing libraries, such as Pytorch, implement. There are many different behaviors difficult to represent and train using RL libraries (good luck trying to learn how to cancel out oscillatory signals), and the notion of success percentage off test or validation data is a relatively useless metric for critical systems. What might make more sense is to form the bridge between surrogate modeling and ML. For example, basic satellite dynamics are polynomial. Training a NN with polynomials as “activation functions” may allow you to find a minimal network capable of achieving certain behaviors (cancelling out the dynamics, for example) where you have now knowledge of the minimum data needed to train the model, what behaviors/hallucinations may or may not be able to exist, and you have other analyses available from standard polynomial regression. On the other hand, if you choose a NN with radial basis functions, then you will have nodes become inactive far on either side of where their ""hump"" may be, and this could result in a significant reduction of hallucinations/compounded effects or having better tamed behavior far away from data used in training.</li><li>Either is acceptable.</li><li>Any is acceptable. I suppose concepts of stability would be a good basis for guarantees. this could then lead to tracking guarantees, avoidance of constraints, etc. I'm interested in the trained model possessing behavior guarantees. if a secondary system must be used (such as a run-time assurance algorithm) in order to intervene to preserve safety, this is avoiding the crux of the issue.</li><li>Online or offline may depend on the theorem or situation model.</li><li>For RL systems with guarantees, attempting to train a large model (where most issues arise from in ML) may be difficult to analyze. Highly specialized controllers with an overarching selection scheme is acceptable if you anticipate this type of solution.</li><li>The main issue is that RL techniques are mostly a novelty and poor choices for critical systems such as satellites. The goal is to bridge the gap between ML and traditional approaches to controls so that RL methods can begin to be considered. To illustrate this, consider a robotic arm with n-linkages. Training a large NN to operate the arm would be expensive and have corner cases that appear which would necessitate protective wrappers (such as RTA). If minimal models could be described for a joint with guarantees and minimal training data determined, then it's possible as multiple joints are connected then perhaps these RL models may also be joined to form wider or deeper networks appropriate for a larger task, be digestible if an issue occurs, and may lead to algorithmic approaches to constructing larger RL models for more complicated tasks with more complicated systems.</li><li>This could be as complicated as we like, but this is mission specific.</li><li>Assume no data is provided. Simulated data is expected to be sufficient.</li><li>A good deliverable would be a solid plan to develop the theorems that achieve the objectives of this topic. I anticipate a thorough literature review along with possibly some validation of various approaches, pitfalls associated with them, etc, supporting the approach. Theoretical developments are the primary benefits of this topic.</li></ol>",,Space Platforms,1,Space Platforms,Space Technology | Trusted AI and Autonomy,Space Technology | Trusted AI and Autonomy,2,Reinforcement learning; nonlinear controls; optimization; satellite control; autonomy,5,Reinforcement learning,Yes,1,Yes,,The focus of this topic is to discover and design machine learning or reinforcement learning architectures for use within a satellite control context which are capable of providing guaranteed closed-loop behavior in a nonlinear controls context.,36,The focus of this topic is to discover and design machine learning or reinforcement learning architectures for use within a satellite control context which are capable of providing guaranteed closed-loop behavior in a nonlinear controls context.,"Machine or reinforcement learning techniques have proven their usefulness in creating control schemes that can handle complicated inputs and maneuver vehicles as intended.

They are &lsquo;smart' heaters, automatically and independently warming each region of the heater circuit to the designed setpoint without a temperature sensor. The electrical resistance of the heater material jumps substantially at the setpoint, inhibiting electric flow and production of heat above the setpoint temperature. Self-regulating heaters are in use in the petrochemical and automotive industries for pipe freeze protection and seat warmers. The space industry needs self-regulating heaters for propellant system heaters where allowable temperature ranges are tight and thermal environments vary in both time and space. Conventional solutions to propellant system thermal control are resource intensive, requiring much engineering design and touch labor as well as much hardware and burdening the flight computer to control the circuits. Self-regulating heaters reduce all of these resource demands. Self-regulating heaters can also provide similar benefits for other satellite heaters such as those for batteries, mechanisms, and antennas. Existing self-regulating heaters are not suited for space applications for several reasons: 1) the form factor is too large and inflexible: existing self-regulating heaters are a stiff cable while satellite self-regulating heaters must be a thin-film heater such as adhesively-applied polyimide heaters commonly used on satellites. Additionally, these heaters must be suitable to install on two orthogonal bend axes: a 1/8&rdquo; bend radius and a 3&rdquo; bend radius, 2) existing self-regulating heaters provide their resistance transition via a melt expansion process to break the percolating path; this means that existing self-regulating heaters cannot be exposed to temperatures greater than their setpoint temperature, 3) Existing self-regulating heaters are not designed to handle the space environment; specifically: vacuum, ionizing radiation, and wide thermal cycles. This topic solicits proposals to develop and commercialize self-regulating heaters for space applications that address these aforementioned insufficiencies of existing self-regulating heaters. Additionally, the materials design must be capable of tuning during manufacturing of the material for setpoint temperatures between -5 and 20 C. A 30:1 (threshold) and 100:1 (objective) turndown ratio between the electrical resistances above and below the setpoint temperature must be achieved. The technology must be capable of yielding designs operating with any voltage between 12 and 100 VDC, and must be capable of producing designs yielding 1 to 10 W/in2 heat flux at the fully ON condition. Capable to withstand exposure to environments in all of the following orbits: 5 years in low earth orbit (LEO), 10 years in middle earth orbit (MEO), or 15 years in geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) including vacuum, ionizing radiation, and thermal cycling. Radiation environments should assume the technology receives 40 mils of spacecraft Aluminum shielding (threshold) or no additional shielding (objective); radiation shields incorporated in the heater will be considered but radiation-hardened heater materials are strongly preferred. Thermal cycles between -5 and 40 C, with LEO 60k cycles, MEO 15k cycles, and GEO 6k cycles. Also survive up to 10 thermal cycles from -40 to 70 C. The material should always remain a solid. The manufacturing process should be scalable, e.g. screen printing techniques; the installation process should minimize touch labor.

The propulsion technology has the potential to deliver a &ldquo;distinct military advantage&rdquo; by significantly improving the size, performance, stability, and unit cost of liquid rocket engines over the existing state of the art constant pressure rocket engine technology in use throughout the space industry. Analyses of the impacts of the propulsion improvements show RDREs deliver a &ldquo;distinct military advantage&rdquo; for specific Military/Dual Use applications of interest to DoD. Potential applications include orbit transfer vehicles (OTV). The environment inside a rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE) is a high-temperature environment confined to a narrow annulus. The local flow is constantly modulated by high-frequency high-pressure high-temperature detonation waves. Obtaining accurate measurements of heat transfer in these devices is difficult. Typically, only limited calorimetry data is available which makes identifying local peak regions impossible. Simulations of RDREs are very costly, the nature of the non-premixed flow field makes it impossible to simplify the geometry. The entire 360&deg; geometry is required including the discrete injectors. These unsteady simulations can cost a million CPU hours for uRANS (unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes) or a few million CPU hours for LES (large eddy simulation). These simulations almost always include adiabatic wall boundary conditions which provide no information on the local heat transfer. The USAF is interested in improved tools that can work with existing uRANS and LES codes to better model and predict the heat transfer in these devices.Conjugate heat transfer (CHT) is one tool that meets the technical requirements of this effort but is cost prohibitive when fully coupled to a 3D time-resolved simulation. CHT provides a way to model the reacting flow in the annulus and the conduction in the walls without an assumption on the interface condition between the walls and the fluid. The slow time scales associated with conduction make this cost prohibitive in a fully coupled operation. Another issue is the resolution of the boundary layer inside the fluid domain. Many RDRE simulations avoid the resolution of the boundary layer to reduce the cost. The boundary layer is key for the heat transfer. A tool to overcome this is a wall model which approximates the boundary layer in the unresolved simulation. These wall models typically rely on assumptions which are violated in the RDRE like fully developed flow, or non-reacting flow.The USAF is looking for creative solutions to this problem. The desired outcome is the development of models that provide predictions for the heat transfer in an RDRE at lower cost compared to a fully coupled 3D unsteady LES/CHT solution. These can include, but are not limited to, Novel wall models for RDRE flow conditions Acceleration and cost reduction techniques for conjugate heat transfer in transient simulations New boundary conditions that approximate the key physics from a LES/CHT Reduced order models for the solid wall state that couple with the LESThe final solution must be scalable to HPC (high-performance computing) applications and be easily integrated with existing MPI based FORTRAN/C++ reacting flow LES codes through libraries with well-defined API's or provided analytical models. Delivery of the source code to the government is required.The thermal prediction capability enabled by delivered engineering-level models for RDRE heat flux will significantly accelerate the engineering development timelines required to transition RDREs for specific applications and reduce the current hardware intensive test-fail-fix approach. This will allow more rapid and low-cost transitions of RDRE technology to the warfighter for several planned applications.",594,4052,1,No,No,No,,The goal of the phase one is to formulate an initial plan to solve this task.

The proposed concepts can include either passive systems, active cooling, or non-traditional options.The intent is to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of low-cost, expendable Thermal Protection Solutions (TPS) or internal thermal management concepts for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. The focus is on identifying and characterizing materials, configurations, or cooling methods-either novel or modified from existing systems (e.g., PICA, RCC)-that provide adequate thermal protection at significantly reduced cost. Phase I aims to validate the thermal performance-to-cost trade space through modeling, small-scale testing, or analytical studies. Proposed solutions should emphasize manufacturability, scalability, and suitability for protecting payloads in the 1&ndash;10 metric ton class.

A key objective of this effort is to help advance and reshape the commercial external thermal protection solution and/or internal thermal management solution industrial base(s) from one focused on high performance and expensive thermal protection solutions that deliver small mass to one focused on good performance and lower costs that still enables survivability of the payload in the 1 to 10 metric ton range. This might require novel new approaches to the design, fabrication, and/or testing of the external thermal protection solution or multiple Thermal Protection Solutions. The DAF is seeking to avoid the cost and inflexibility created by developing specialty solutions for this regime. External protections can be expendable as long as the contents inside the containers survive.The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is pursuing new opportunities for Rocket Cargo materiel transport that require payload survivability following atmospheric reentry-without the cost or complexity of human-rated Thermal Protection Systems (TPS). Current TPS technologies are often over-engineered and cost-prohibitive for cargo-class missions, particularly in the 1 to 10 metric ton payload range. This topic seeks innovative, low-cost, expendable external TPS or internal thermal management solutions for non-human-rated atmospheric reentry containers. Solutions may include new passive materials, active cooling systems, or modified commercial off-the-shelf technologies such as Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) or Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) adapted for affordability.The objective is to reshape the industrial base from one centered on exquisite performance to one optimized for cost-effective survivability of critical payloads. Proposed approaches should emphasize manufacturability, repeatability, and integration potential for materiel transport missions. Expendability is acceptable so long as the payload remains intact and functional post-reentry. Novel design, fabrication, and testing strategies are encouraged, especially those that reduce thermal protection cost without compromising safety or performance in realistic reentry environments.",323,2397,1,No,No,No,,"This Phase I effort will demonstrate a concept for a low-cost Thermal Protection Solution idea or conduct a feasibility study that is capable of showing the thermal protection properties in relation to the cost.

The objective of Phase II is to mature and validate the low-cost thermal protection solution or internal thermal management concept developed in Phase I. This phase should focus on refining the design, fabricating a functional prototype, and conducting rigorous testing to evaluate performance in both laboratory and simulated reentry conditions.Key goals of Phase II include: Engineering Development: Advance the design to a manufacturable and scalable prototype, incorporating insights from Phase I analysis and material characterization.

A: We are open to alternatives.&nbsp;

Q2 (08/05/2025): As a Direct to Phase II project, we understand that a Phase I proof of concept is expected. Our current proof-of-concept system is focused on drone detection rather than upper atmospheric targets. Would that be an issue?
A: While I am not a member of SpaceWERX, I believe you may be mistaken about the need for a Phase 1. The purpose of Direct to Phase 2 is to allow exception for promising solutions which have not completed a Phase 1 SBIR. In either case, I cannot confirm for you whether a drone-tracking system will be viable technically. You will have to demonstrate that. However, there is no issue repurposing other technology for a new use cases.&nbsp;

A key enabler of this superiority is space domain awareness (SDA) which is the ability to detect, track, and characterize objects and activities in space in near-real-time.

Q2 (06/10/2025): If travel is permitted, could you please specify the designated primary deployment site?
A: We do not have a primary deployment site at this time. The best area of travel, if needed, would be CONUS.

Q3 (06/10/2025): I see that this question has already been asked twice before, however, the page limit for Technical Volume 2 is now showing as 10 pages &nbsp;as of Version 4 of the solicitation instructions for this topic. &nbsp;Can you confirm if 10 pages is now the page count limit for the Technical Volume? Thank you.
A: A topic change request was submitted to increase the Technical Volume page limit from 5 pages to 10 pages. With this change, 5 pages can be fully dedicated to the technical volume write-up and the other 5 pages will account for everything else such as the cover page, table of contents, and the glossary. In total, the Technical Volume section should not exceed 10 pages and that is including everything.

Q4 (06/10/2025): Do resumes count towards the 5 page limit?
A: In total, the Technical Volume section should not exceed 10 pages and that is including everything.

Q5 (06/09/2025): The latest release of the Air Force instructions show a page limit increase to 10 pages. Does this increase to a 10-page maximum inclusive of the Title page, Table of Contents, and Glossary, or are these sections still considered outside the 10-page limit now listed?
A: &nbsp;A topic change request was submitted to increase the Technical Volume page limit from 5 pages to 10 pages. With this change, 5 pages can be fully dedicated to the technical volume write-up and the other 5 pages will account for everything else such as the cover page, table of contents, and the glossary.

Q7 (06/06/2025): Regarding focus area 3 (Situational Awareness):Is the USSF interested in downstream situational awareness visualization of the totality of the contested space? Integrating real-time spectrum monitoring, signal intelligence, and predictive analytics together with other data feeds from battlespace assets and feeds from intelligence sources related to adversarial assets and activities? Or is the interest narrowly defined to “Provide real-time spectrum monitoring, signal intelligence, and predictive analytics to enhance electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) operations.” How expansive is the concept of situational awareness understood?
A: In order to bound the proposals, we prefer the narrow definition.

Q8 (06/05/2025): Are you open to or even encouraging FFP proposals (Section 5.1 of BAA preface says it is at the discretion of the Component Contracting Officer)?
A: The contract will be a FFP.&nbsp;

Q9 (06/04/2025): Please provide page limitations for all the other volumes 3-7
A: At this time, there are no true page limits other than what is set in the instructions for the other volume sections as DSIP will not block an upload based on the number of pages.

Q10 (06/04/2025): <span style=""background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(63,67,80);"">In the AFWERX challenge AMA, the presenters said that the feasibility study is part of the technical volume and subject to the 5 page limit. Can you confirm if this is correct?</span>
A: Yes that is correct. It is recommended that SBCs call out how their technology has demonstrated technical merit and satisfied feasibility requirements BRIEFLY in the Technical Volume section. However, since this is a D2P2 effort, SBCs should prioritize including information in this section related to the Phase II effort. SBCs can attach any additional information on their Phase I feasibility proof/documentation to the Supporting Documents section of their proposal submission. Essentially, this will allow SBCs to directly call out how the Phase I feasibility proof/documentation is satisfied in the Technical Volume section while providing additional supporting information as necessary in the Supporting Documents section.

Q11 (06/04/2025): Is there a TPOC or POC we can reach out to? Our team has some technical questions&nbsp;
A: Since May 28th marked the start of the Open Period for the 25.4/D – Release 8 solicitation, the TPOCs for this topic can no longer contact small businesses outside of the DSIP Q&amp;A Platform. However, you can post any technical questions related to Topic ID: SF254-D801 on this DSIP Q&amp;A Platform.&nbsp;

Q12 (06/04/2025): <span style=""background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgba(0,0,0,0.87);"">I noted that the cover page and glossary do not count towards the page count, </span>Is the Milestone Identification Section included in the 5 page limit?&nbsp;
A: A topic change request has been submitted to increase the Technical Volume page limit from 5 pages to 10 pages. With this change, 5 pages can be fully dedicated to the technical volume write-up and the other 5 pages will account for everything else such as the cover page, table of contents, and the glossary. In total, the Technical Volume section should not exceed 10 pages and that is including everything.&nbsp;

Q13 (06/02/2025): Please clarify<strong> “evidence of a product-mission fit with a potential Air Force or Space Force stakeholder.” Does this indicate a direct engagement with a potential DAF AFWERX/SpaceWERX end user? Or does this indicate that we provide information/evidence of how our product would fit with a potential AF stakeholder in the proposal?</strong>Also, please confirm no letter of support is necessary.<br>&nbsp;
A: <ol><li>The second assertion is correct. The potential Air Force or Space Force stakeholder is referring to a potential Air Force or Space Force stakeholder or end user and NOT an AFWERX or SpaceWERX end user.&nbsp;</li><li>No letter of support is required for this topic.&nbsp;</li></ol>

Q14 (05/28/2025): I noted that the cover page and glossary do not count towards the page count. Does the table of contents count towards the page count?&nbsp;
A: The Table of Contents in the Technical Volume does NOT count against the 5-page limit.&nbsp;

Q15 (05/28/2025): Does the Table of Contents in the Technical Volume count against the 5 page limit of the technical volume?
A: The Table of Contents in the Technical Volume does NOT count against the 5-page limit.&nbsp;

Q16 (05/23/2025): Given the 5-page limit and the requirement to include all the Technical Volume (Volume 2) details, does the offeror still need to separate the Work Plan via page breaks? &nbsp;We would recommend that this Work Plan section be clearly identified, but not required to be split to its own page(s) due to page limits for the entire technical volume.
A: Given the 5-page limit and the requirement to include all the Technical Volume details, the offeror does NOT need to separate the Work Plan via page breaks. The decision to use or not to use page breaks is up to the offeror.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally and for everyone's awareness, the Cover Page and Glossary do NOT count against the 5 page limit. Second, in terms of prioritization, most of the page count should be on the Technical Objectives, Work Plan, and Deliverables—especially if the deliverables are outside the listed requirements. (Though obviously all sections should be referenced).

Q17 (05/22/2025): The solicitation states that ``The goal of the Phase 2 effort is to mature technologies to a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7''.Do you have a minimum entry TRL for technologies for this proposal? Can a SATCOM technology at TRL 3 as of May 2025 apply for the D2P2 effort?Please clarify.
A: There is NOT a minimum entry TRL for technologies that can be submitted for this topic. However, a technology currently at TRL 3 does seem to be appropriate for this effort.&nbsp;

Q18 (05/13/2025): Is a DAF AFWERX/SpaceWERX Customer Memorandum form required to submit a proposal for this opportunity, like the Customer Memorandum form required for D2P2 opportunities?&nbsp;
A: No, the DAF AFWERX/SpaceWERX Customer Memorandum form is NOT a requirement for this topic. Currently, Customer Memorandum forms are required for Open Topic solicitations and not Specific Topic solicitations. Since this is a Specific Topic solicitation, this form is not a requirement.&nbsp;

Q19 (05/09/2025): <ol><li>Since there are multiple Focus areas. Is there an award expected for each focus area? Any insight on how many awards in total?</li><li>Can a company submit multiple proposals addressing different solutions addressing different focus areas?</li></ol>
A: <ol><li>There is not an expected award for each focus area. This topic will have 8 awards in total.</li><li>Yes, a company can submit multiple proposals addressing different solutions to the different focus areas.&nbsp;</li></ol>

A: Yes, the technical volume page limit for this effort is supposed to be listed as 5 pages.&nbsp;

Q21 (05/07/2025): Is the page limit for the technical volume supposed to be listed as 5 pages or 35 pages like most D2P2 solicitation topics? If it is 5 pages, how would the Space Force like to prioritize the technical volume sections to fit within that page limit?
A: Yes, the technical volume page limit for this effort is supposed to be listed as 5 pages.&nbsp;&nbsp;As clarification, all sections need to be completed, in the order specified in the solicitation instructions.

By advancing these core capabilities, this topic will meet the Department of Air Force's (DAF) Operational Imperative 1 &ldquo;Defining Resilient and Effective Space Order of Battle and Architectures,&rdquo; and 7 &ldquo;Readiness of the Department of the Air Force to transition to a wartime posture against a peer competitor.&rdquo; As the space operational environment evolves, there is a need for new technologies and capabilities in non-traditional orbital regimes that allow for a more sustainable and resilient environment. Understanding the space environment's impact on satellite operations and anomalies, communications, positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) signals is critical to both U.S. national security and commercial space operations. Currently space weather specification and forecast rely on a limited set of observational assets, and there is a lack of standardized solutions for capturing global ionospheric and thermospheric data. This program aims to develop a low-cost method to collect and analyze environmental data that will enhance space weather specification and forecasting capabilities. The method could span the range from a low-cost low SWAP sensor to be hosted on a space-based platform to an expendable self-contained sensor similar to the dropsondes used to collect data for terrestrial weather prediction. Relevant measurements include the total density and composition of both neutral and plasma species, electric fields, and wind. Novel concepts involving systems as a sensor concepts or remote sensing of embedded objects are encouraged. The Space Force is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions with similar counterparts in the commercial sector. The Space Force in partnership with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/RV) aims to explore innovative technology domains with demonstrated commercial value in the non-Defense sector, i.e., through existing products/solutions, in order to obtain Space Force applications, i.e. Dual-Purpose Technologies/Solutions. It is important that potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. Thus, solutions should be closely tied to commercial technologies and solutions supporting the solution's development. Proposals for this topic should demonstrate a high probability of identifying a product-market fit between a Space Force end user and the proposed solution through a non-Defense commercial solution's adaptation. This topic seeks to explore potential commercial products enabling SBEM in VLEO through either the development of a low-cost attritable platform or further development of state-of-the-art sensors for operations in VLEO.",402,2854,1,No,No,No,,"This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II.

The region of space above the Earth, at approximately 100-400 km, offers unique opportunities for in-situ measurements of space weather data. Space weather forecasting involves the combination of various data sources within the ionosphere and thermosphere as well as implementing detailed physics-based models. Currently, there are minimal standardized solutions that capture global space environmental data in the 100-400 km range (such as electric field measurements, molecular data, temperature, density, winds, etc.). This project focuses on developing a low-cost, small satellite platform specifically designed for VLEO operations to conduct in-situ measurements of the various layers within the thermosphere and ionosphere. Past efforts in lower thermosphere-ionosphere research have primarily relied on sounding rockets, ground-based radar systems, and sparse satellite measurements. While these methods have provided valuable snapshots of various data such as electron density, plasma temperature, and electric field dynamics, they lack the ability to deliver continuous, real-time data required for accurate space weather forecasting. This platform should provide a persistent, standardized solution to address space weather gaps in specification and forecast by augmenting traditional research conducted through ground-based observations, sounding rocket campaigns and other traditional space-based observation platforms with continuous, high-resolution data collection.The proposed solution could be optimized to host Langmuir Probes and Electric Field Probes (EFPs), which are critical for studying electron density, plasma temperature, electric fields, and ionospheric dynamics in the 100-400 km altitude range. Non-conventional specialty sensors that may provide benefits in the 100-400 km range are also of interest, to include innovative low-cost solutions to measuring even one of the critical parameters.Successful Phase-II proposals should emphasize innovative concepts such as rapid prototyping, drop-sounds like concepts that might be monitored remotely, and onboard AI-driven data processing for efficient data downlink and real-time analysis. Project scope should also include an end-to-end capability ready for demonstration in a relevant operational environment, including initial development of potential design reference missions.",Some solutions may go from Phase II to Phase III as soon as the product-market fit is verified. Potential Phase III awardees will transition the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability for a broad range of potential Governmental and civilian users and alternate mission applications.,1,Technology Readiness Assessment Best Practice Guide - https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20205003605/downloads/%20SP-20205003605%20TRA%20BP%20Guide%20FINAL.pdf.; TRL Guide - https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-48g.pdf.; https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/EarthObservation/ENLoTIS_Report_ISSUED_2024.pdf.; https://spacewerx.us/.,Technology Readiness Assessment Best Practice Guide - https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20205003605/downloads/%20SP-20205003605%20TRA%20BP%20Guide%20FINAL.pdf.; TRL Guide - https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-48g.pdf.; https://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/EarthObservation/ENLoTIS_Report_ISSUED_2024.pdf.; https://spacewerx.us/.,4,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/4824b5354b12487ebdedb92135a4ddd9_86258/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/4824b5354b12487ebdedb92135a4ddd9_86258/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,DoD 25.4 SBIR BAA Preface_Release 8_05072025.pdf,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,1609301.0,DoD 25.4 SBIR BAA Preface_Release 8_05072025.pdf,Yes,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:26:56,,,,,SF254-D802_4824b535,DOD_SBIR_2025_P1_C4_SF254-D802,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:36.037679+00

Specifically, this project aims to further develop and enhance the magnetic navigation (MagNav) techniques by developing a space-based remote sensing platform to operate in very low earth orbit (VLEO), capable of collecting the data necessary to map the Earth's crustal magnetic field. By advancing these core capabilities, this topic will meet the Department of Air Force's (DAF) Operational Imperative 1 &ldquo;Defining Resilient and Effective Space Order of Battle and Architectures.&rdquo;Recognizing the increasing vulnerability of systems dependent on GNSS, this VLEO Magnetic Mapper (VMM) project aims to develop magnetic navigation as a robust alternative navigation capability for use in GNSS-denied environments. This project will research, design, and plan a demonstration magnetic mapping mission using a remote sensing satellite to operate in VLEO. This space-based mapping will provide a crucial foundation for augmenting and calibrating localized magnetic navigation maps currently generated from air and ground-based surveys. By collecting data across the globe from altitudes between 100km and 350km, this project will address critical limitations in current magnetic navigation map making capabilities, including access in highly contested areas, air and ground sensor limitations, algorithmic challenges, and the presence of inconsistent or missing map data, particularly in strategically important military areas.The project's scope encompasses strong collaboration across strategic partnering agencies as well as ties to various international partners as part of the Responsive Space Capabilities (RSC) Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This work will support ongoing effort within the RSC MOU which initiates, conducts, and manages research, development, test, and evaluation cooperation related to responsive space capabilities and aims to validate and execute the feasibility of a VLEO satellite-based mapping mission. This collaboration will be essential for conducting comprehensive mission analysis, optimizing mission design, and executing the build, test, and launch phases of the demonstration mission. The ultimate objective is to generate usable global magnetic field data that can be directly applied in subsequent testing and development of MagNav applications.

Proposed solutions should consider shorter life spans (<12 months) for the initial demonstration mission and heavily factor in size, weight, power and costs (SWaP-C) limitations associated with the development of operating at very low altitudes. This project aims to rapidly advance the state of what is possible and use the cost value proposition of operating in a VLEO environment for shorter periods vs. larger, bespoke systems that have exquisite capabilities. A successful proposal should also consider future designs for a satellite constellation or a set of extremely low-orbiting satellites to be launched in succession, to support crustal magnetic field mapping.

Design reference missions (DRM) and final orbit configurations will be worked jointly with NGA and USSF based on independent assessments and analysis completed for this effort.The satellite design should consider various complications that may arise from operating in lower altitudes (<300km) such command and control (C2) operations for short contact windows, propulsion needed to maintain very low altitude orbits, platform interference with magnetometer payloads, platform stability, etc. The nominal payload suite includes vector and scalar magnetometers, star cameras, GPS receiver, etc. Proposed solutions should consider the full spectrum of what is possible to achieve the desired data from this demonstration mission. Alternative payload designs may incorporate the state-of-the-art sensing techniques for magnetic anomaly detection such as the use of quantum magnetometers (e.g. Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy, Optically Pumped, etc). Importantly, the satellite bus should be tightly integrated with the instruments needed to enable high-accuracy, scientific measurements. In particular, a successful proposed solution will minimize payload interactions with the platform (such as magnetic field instruments deployed on booms) and enable accurate measurements of magnetic fields, to ensure that highest quality data are obtained.

EXAMPLES:&nbsp;&nbsp; QUOTE:&nbsp; &ldquo;<b><u>Microprocessor:</u></b> The Air Force needed microprocessors that were no longer produced by the original manufacturer for its F-15 flight-control computer. These microprocessors were procured from a broker and F15 technicians noticed additional markings on the microprocessor and character spacing inconsistent with the original part. A total of four counterfeit microprocessors were found and as a result were not installed on the F-15&rsquo;s operational flight control computers.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Global Positioning System: <b><u>Oscillators</u></b> used for navigation on over 4,000 Air Force and Navy systems experienced a high failure rate and failed a retest. These oscillators were provided by a supplier that Global Positioning System engineers had previously disapproved as a supply source. Air Force officials stated that while the failure would not cause a safety-of-flight issue, it could prevent some unmanned systems from returning from their missions.&rdquo;

The AFNWC commander is dual-hatted as the Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Strategic Systems, and the NC3 Integration director is dual-hatted as the Air Force PEO for NC3.ADVANCED AUTOMATED ANALYSIS METHODS FOR CRITICAL SYSTEM EVALUATIONS - Develop a capability to automatically import, process, and assess system states that lead to a user defined end-state. Output digital state diagrams that lead to user defined system end state conditions and identify common/singular nodes that are critical to achieve user defined end-state.ADVANCED PARTS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - AFNWC is seeking a parts management tool that can predict demand and obsolescence problems and optimize inventory levels to ensure availability of parts to improve weapon system readiness.ALTERNATIVE TO GPS-BASED NAVIGATION - A low size, weight, and power (SWAP) navigational solution is needed that can provide accurate navigational data in the absence of GPS.AR/VR TECHNOLOGIES - Current VR solutions are non-user friendly, unsafe, or awkward to use. VR objects and environments are currently unrealistic, and lack a &ldquo;real-world&rdquo; feel. A realistic omnidirectional locomotion system is needed that can support user training needs.ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR COUNTERFEIT PARTS - We need an AI solution to aid in identifying potential military counterfeit parts.DIGITAL ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGIES - We are seeking digital engineering solutions (methods, processes, and tools) to transform the engineering, research, requirements, acquisition, test, cost, and sustainment communities. Examples include code inspection, business tools, modeling/simulation/analysis, and data analysis/validation/visualization tools to facilitate cyber security and nuclear surety certification activities.DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT TOOLS DEVELOPMENT - Minuteman III (MMIII) uses outdated tools incapable of consolidating technical data across disciplines and associated supporting organizations. MMIII requires updated digital tools to manage weapon system technical data and transfer years of MMIII data to the replacement of the weapon system.DIGITAL SOLUTIONS FOR SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT (SCRM) - We are interested in a digital tool for managing supply chain risk by identifying susceptibilities, vulnerabilities and threats throughout DoD's &ldquo;supply chain&rdquo; and developing mitigation strategies to combat those threats whether presented by the supplier, the supplied product and its subcomponents, or the supply chain (e.g., initial production, packaging, handling, storage, transport, mission operation, and disposal). Proposed software tool must integrate data, enable data visualization, provide data analytic functions, and have the ability to share information between various government organizations, agencies, and contractors. Enterprise-wide solution must allow individual users to access all appropriate and relevant data in order to make data-driven decisions based on their individual role/function.DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION FOR AIR DELIVERED CAPABILITIES - We seek a method to incorporate digital engineering tools into our sustainment programs. Using SysML and common digital engineering tools, we need a digital environment that can be used across the spectrum of our sustainment portfolio.DIGITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF AUTHORITATIVE RESOURCES - Many documents developed during the procurement of Air Force systems are not in digital format and provide technical and operational instructions/policies that evolve throughout time. In some cases, it is difficult to determine which document is authoritative (the most current policy/guide). We need a tool to establish digitization and management of authoritative resources as we transition to a digital engineering environment.HYBRID CERAMIC THROATS FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROPELLANTS - Technology for hybrid ceramic throats needs to be developed and matured to enhance range, speed, and size, weight, and power (SWAP) efficiency of missile systems.KUBERNETES DAY 1/DAY 2 SERVICE IMPROVEMENT AT THE TACTICAL EDGE - We need a service that enables an operator with minimal training to manage Day 1/Day 2 operations for Platform One Kubernetes based mission applications and Kubernetes environments for disconnected clusters/at the tactical edge. &bull; Day 1: Tasks required to deploy &bull; Day 2: Tasks required to operate and maintainMISSILE FIELD REAL-TIME &ldquo;HEALTH OF FLEET&rdquo; CAPABILITY - Watchtower, the MFs' current Real-Time Common Operating Picture framework, fuses and visualizes missile field data, but lacks a tool/application for Real-Time &ldquo;Health of the Fleet&rdquo; assessment. This topic seeks the innovative power of small businesses to develop, demonstrate, and deliver tools/applications that are suitable for integration, and operational use for agilely and reliably assessing ICBM fleet health and informing resource optimization for fleet health risk management.NOVEL UTILITY CORRIDOR TRENCHING/TRENCHLESS METHODS - Current traditional trenching/trenchless methods for installing fiber optic cables at depths of up to 8 feet are significantly limited by soil types and environmental/real estate constraints. An economical trenching/trenchless method is needed for installing fiber optics at depths of up to 8 feet with minimal environmental and real estate impacts.NUCLEAR PROTECTION OF CARBON-CARBON COMPOSITES - We need to develop innovative processing trials and techniques to enhance nuclear protection of carbon-carbon aeroshells and motor components for future systems.ROBOTICS - Develop a robotic application that can approach the challenges of general maintenance of nuclear facilities, project test preparation and such applications of value to nuclear weapon systems or infrastructure that can improve performance or overcome challenges.SCALE-UP AND TESTING OF HARDENED AEROSHELLS TO THERMO-MECHANICAL EFFECTS - We need to characterize, scale-up, and test hardened aeroshell material technologies to enable system level enhancements to future missiles and subsystems.SEA-BASED PLATFORM SYSTEM FOR TESTING - ICBM test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the weapon system and provide valuable data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. However, current flight test tracking and scoring systems have limited capabilities are hard to sustain. A replacement sea-based scoring platform is needed. &bull; See https://www.afnwc.af.mil/News/Article/2398073/afnwc-team-supports-icbm-test-launch/ for background info.SOFTWARE BILL OF MATERIAL (SBOM) INTEGRATION WITH DOD PLATFORM ONE - Establish a consistent approach for DOD Platform One tooling to produce a Software Bill of Material (SBOM).STAKEHOLDER CONCERN-DIRECTED MODELING - We need improved modeling practices to allow Stakeholders to dynamically query requirements or architectural models in order to satisfy their concerns over the system(s) being defined by those models.STRATEGIC RADIATION HARDENED (RAD-HARD) MICROELECTRONICS (ME) - The nuclear enterprise requires a trusted supply of advanced strategic radiation-hardened microelectronics (Rad-Hard ME). Radiation effects modeling tools, Rad-Hard ME design rules, enabling technologies, hardness assurance test methods and hardness surveillance protocols are needed to support current AFNWC systems and future needs.TECHNOLOGY DATABASE - The driving pace and competition for leading-edge technology across the Air Force and industry has outpaced our ability to track innovation and technology opportunities across the varied industry sectors. We need a centralized repository that is able to identify and track technology development efforts across the AFNWC, industry and academia.TELEMETRY PACKAGE (RECEIVER) FOR TRACKING AND TERMINAL SCORING - ICBM test launches verify the accuracy and reliability of the weapon system and provide valuable data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. However, current flight test tracking and scoring systems have limited capabilities are hard to sustain. A telemetry package (operating in S or L band) is needed to receive telemetry data and send encrypted data to land-based control station. &bull; See https://www.afnwc.af.mil/News/Article/2398073/afnwc-team-supports-icbm-test-launch/ for background info.Proposals for technologies and solutions not previously considered and which may not fit directly within one of the twenty-three areas are also welcomed.",1180,8787,1,No,No,No,,"This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into a Phase II. Therefore, a Phase I award is not required. The offeror is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a &ldquo;Phase I like&rdquo; effort, including a feasibility study (Volume 2). This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-market fit between the proposed solution and a potential AF stakeholder. The offeror should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the AF customer. The feasibility study should have: -Identified the prime potential AF end user(s) for the non-Defense commercial offering to solve the AF need, i.e., how it has been modified; -Described integration cost and feasibility with current mission-specific products; -Described if/how the demonstration can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.","Eligibility for D2P2 is predicated on the offeror having performed a &ldquo;Phase I-like&rdquo; effort at least in part separate from the SBIR Programs.

Slide decks shall consist of no more than 12 slides. All slides shall be numbered consecutively, and each slide shall contain the company name, topic number, and proposal number assigned by DSIP. A sample slide deck is provided at Attachment X. Offerors may, but are not required to, utilize this sample as a template. Failure to provide a DRAFT slide deck within Volume 5 will be cause for rejection of the proposal without evaluation.Offerors are encouraged to identify the applicable technical area above in the proposal's title or subtitle.This Pitch Day topic will utilize a three step evaluation/selection process, labeled below as Initial Peer Review, Clarifications, and Pitch Day.Initial Peer Review: Proposals that conform to the requirements within this CSO will be peer reviewed on the following criteria, listed in descending order of importance:The appropriateness and relevance in fulfilling a need of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC). An account of how the proposal meets an AFNWC technical area indicates appropriateness and relevance. While not required, a signed customer memorandum and/or letter of support from other Government personnel may be indicators of appropriateness and relevance.Technical approach. The technical approach soundness, technical merit, and innovation of the proposed technical approach, as well as its differentiation from current customer alternatives. Includes the proposed Principal Investigators'/Project Managers', supporting staff, and consultants' qualifications to execute the proposed approach.The potential for Government or private sector commercialization and benefits expected to accrue from commercialization. The SBC's record of commercializing SBIR or other research, the existence of Phase II follow-on commitments for the subject research, and matching funding, whether from Government or private sources, are evidence of commercialization potential.Based on the outcome of this evaluation and funds availability, technically acceptable proposals will be invited to participate in Pitch Day. Offerors will be advised via electronic correspondence.Clarifications: This step consists of limited interactions between the Government and offerors invited to Pitch Day to allow the Government to streamline award issuance following Pitch Day. After notice of invitation but prior to Pitch Day, offerors may be contacted by the awarding Contracting Office to gain clarification on proposal elements to include, but not limited to, data rights assertions and cost volume elements. This contact should not be construed to mean award is assured. Additionally, during this step, Offerors may be provided with questions from the Government regarding technical approach. Said questions will be asked to gain further insight into the approach proposed and can be addressed within the FINAL slide deck to be presented on at Pitch Day; proposal revisions will not be allowed and responses to posed clarifications shall be included as part of the FINAL slide deck. No proposal elimination is conducted during this step.Pitch Day: Those offerors invited to Pitch Day will receive event information, e.g. date/time, via electronic correspondence. Offerors must attend the Pitch Day either virtually or in-person to be considered for award. No award preference will be given to those who attend in-person. Please note, the Pitch Day may be held virtually in its entirety for all offerors.On Pitch Day offerors will present their FINAL slide deck. The FINAL slide deck shall reflect the technical approach presented for the Initial Peer Review; no material changes to the technical approach are allowed. The slide limit and formatting information enforced for the DRAFT applies to the FINAL slide deck. FINAL slide decks must be submitted to the Government prior to Pitch Day. Information regarding submission of the FINAL slide deck will be provided via electronic correspondence during the Clarifications step. Failure to provide a FINAL slide deck by the required deadline will result in disqualification from Pitch Day and award.Pitch Day presentations will be used to validate the Initial Peer Review. A Pitch Day presentation could provide additional clarification or insight on the ability to fulfill Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center needs, technical approach, and/or potential for commercialization, serving as a basis to elevate the proposal in priority for funding.

Q12 (07/11/2022): Section 5.3.2 of the BAA states: &quot;A sample slide deck is provided at Attachment 5. The white paper is optional and the content is at the offeror&rsquo;s discretion; therefore, a template is not provided.&quot;&nbsp; Section 5.1 of the BAA&nbsp;shows all of the components that can be included in a full submission, and indicates that only a 25-slide deck is permissible in Volume 2 with no mention of a white paper. Can you please clarify if a white paper is accepted for this submission?
A: Phase 1 requires a slide deck (max 25 slides), and the follow-on Phase 2, and D2P2 requires a white paper (max 15 pages)

Q13 (07/08/2022): Our company is already in the process of identifying AF stakeholders to obtain an MOU.&nbsp; Can we still apply to this topic if we have received an MOU just prior to the submission deadline?
A: The Phase 1 topics do not require a Customer Memorandum, so yes you may apply prior to the submission deadline. However if you already have a Customer Memorandum, applying to the D2P2 solicitation may be more appropriate. Of note, we occasionally update the Customer Memo format, so if you get it signed now prior to Phase 1 submission, it may no longer be the correct format for the follow-on Phase 2 submission.&nbsp;

Q14 (07/07/2022): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Our company has demonstrated some innovative applications of a reasonably well established core technology, namely using plasma to clean optics, radiators, and other contaminated critical surfaces on orbiting spacecraft, optimally applied during satellite refueling operations.&nbsp; Similar to a service station attendant in the &#39;50s offering to clean your windows while your tank is being filled.&nbsp; And we have done R&amp;D and testing to get to a TRL of 3 or 4.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">We believe that this aligns well with certain aspects of Space Force&#39;s brief to reduce the risks of generating orbital debris, in part by refueling/refurbishing/repurposing viable satellites that are already on-orbit, rather than launching replacements, with the attendant risks.&nbsp; In the commercial satellite servicing market, refueling is the primary focus, so for now, DAF and other gov&#39;t groups provide a longer term outlook as to the applicability of this cleaning technology.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">However, from the &quot;COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS OPENING&quot; title and some additional language in the solicitation, the focus of the solicitation appears to be on transitioning commercially available, or at least commercially nascent, solutions into the DAF sphere.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">We don&#39;t want to waste time and resources (yours and ours) on submission of a non-starter proposal, but we would also prefer not to pass up a viable opportunity to work with SMEs within DAF.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">In your interpretation of the documentation, is there latitude within this solicitation for a proposal that addresses revamping of existing terrestrial commercial technology for use in space, by an SBC with as yet no current commercial applications?
A: The Open Topic program welcomes all technology solutions that meet an Air Force or Space Force need. We do not target a specific range of TRLs or technology maturity, and welcome all submissions that can address a problem or improve operations within the DAF.&nbsp;

Q15 (06/29/2022): Can the difference between the three solicitations (X224-OCSO1,&nbsp;X224-ODCSO1, and&nbsp;X224-ODCSO2) be clarified?&nbsp; Other than the difference between Space Force and Air Force is there a difference?&nbsp; Can the same submission be submitted to both if we have an MOU from both the Air Force and the Space Force?
A: We have a D2P2 SBIR solicitation with an Air Force topic and a Space Force topic. We also have a Phase 1 solicitation for both SBIR and STTR, although the Phase 1 solicitation combines Air Force and Space Force needs into the same topic. Yes, you can submit a proposal to each topic if your proposal meets solicitation requirements. For D2P2, the Customer Memo should describe how it meets a Air Force or Space Force need. &nbsp;

Q16 (06/29/2022): With two solicitations&nbsp;open (one USSF and one USAF) can a company submit the same proposal to each of them?&nbsp; Is there a requirement for two MOU&#39;s (one from SF and one from AF) in order to do this?&nbsp;&nbsp;
A: Yes, a company may submit a proposal both the D2P2 Air Force topic and the D2P2 Space Force topic. There is no requirement in the solicitation to have unique Customer Memorandums, however they will be evaluated to ensure they meet an Air Force need, or a Space Force need, depending on which D2P2 topic the proposal was submitted to.&nbsp;

Q17 (06/23/2022): Amendment 2 states: &quot;The Performance of Work requirements associated with Section 5.3.3.3.b is changed to onehalf of the total contract value&quot;. But section 5.3.5.2.e of Amendment 6 states: &quot;The proposed total of all&nbsp;consultant fees, facility leases/usage fees, and/or other subcontract or&nbsp;purchase agreements, may not exceed one-third of the total contract&nbsp;price/cost, ...&quot;.

Is it 1/2 or 1/3?&nbsp;
A: The Amendment 2 was erroneous. The proposed total of all consultant fees, facility leases, and/or usage fees, and other subcontract or purchase agreements may not exceed one-third of the total contract price or cost, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. This will be addressed by a future solicitation Amendment.

Q18 (06/18/2022): Per attachment 5 in the BAA, the X22.4 SAMPLE SLIDE DECK can be accessed at https://rt.cto.mil/rtl-small-business-resources/sbirsttr, however, when I click that link and navigate around the page I am not able to locate the sample&nbsp;slide deck.&nbsp; Are you able to clarify where the sample slide deck is located on that site?&nbsp; Thank you!
A: The slides are available at the following location: https://afwerx.com/sbir-sttr-program-overview/&nbsp;

Q19 (06/16/2022): Hi, relatively new to this portal, so pls forgive the ignorance. But where do I go to obtain the official solicitation once I land on the &quot;https://rt.cto.mil/rtl-small-business-resources/sbir-sttr/&quot; webpage? It tells me that the DoD SBIR/STTR has a new look and to &quot;click here&quot;, which when I do it takes me to &quot;https://www.defensesbirsttr.mil/&quot;, there is no option to search for this specific bid request.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
A: The solicitation and submission is within DSIP (Defense SBIR/STTR Innovation Portal), located at https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/submissions/login.

Q20 (05/18/2022): For Phase II submission is an MOU not required?
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
All Open Topic Phase 2s and Direct to Phase 2s (D2P2) require a Customer Memorandum, which must use the required template provided in the 22.4/D solicitation.

Q21 (05/18/2022): We already have a completed phase I that needs transition to phase II. Is it possible to submit under this topic to do so?
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
For a Direct to Phase 2 (D2P2) submission, the proposal must clearly identify prior work on the solution that is similar to a feasibility study, and this prior work cannot be fully funded under a previous SBIR/STTR contract. In other words, you must identify prior feasibility efforts outside of any previous Phase I work.

Q22 (05/15/2022): In the description, it lists &quot;3 months and $75,000&quot;, the downloaded instructions has a chart with about 30 lines, most of which say 9 months and $150,000. Can you clarify the length and maximum award amount for this phase 1?
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
The 22.4/D solicitation for Phase 1 allows for up to 3 months and $75,000.

Q23 (05/11/2022): Hi Jenna,

A 2018 SOAR (DSIAC-2018-0849) stated that most of the current fleet of UAS have limitations leading to airframes <em>&quot;designed for fairly low-performance, undemanding flight. They are not generally expected to have high speed and maneuverability or to operate in defended airspace.&quot;</em>

Our airframe technology focuses on efficient flight which yields high speeds, high maneuverability, high payload capacities, extreme endurance and high altitudes for the size and propulsion energy.

Is there an interest in a family of UAS&mdash;from hand launched to global high altitude ISR&mdash;designed for high performance, speed and maneuverability to operate in defended airspace?
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
The 22.4/D Open Topic solicitation will accept a proposal for any solution that meets a clear DAF need.

Q24 (05/11/2022): Hello. &nbsp;I&#39;m working on an open topic proposal and noticed that there are two different but very similar solicitations,&nbsp;X224-OCSO1 and&nbsp;X22D-OTCSO1. &nbsp;What types of ideas should go to one vs. the other? &nbsp;Thank you!&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A: 

Q2 (07/22/2022): Our company has developed a capability using non-SBIR AFRL funds, in which a different DAF organization has a clear interest as an End-User.&nbsp; Would this be eligible for D2P2 funding?
A: 

Q3 (07/21/2022): With the $1.25M being the amended funding amount, is there a defined breakdown of individual ceiling cost for both the Base and Year 2? Or is the division between the two at the discretion of the proposing company?
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">There is no mandated structure for the payment milestone schedules beyond

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">what is dictated in the solicitation, however all Milestone Payment

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">schedules are subject to review and potential negotiation by the Government

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">prior to award execution.

Q4 (07/21/2022): As the other question asked, I am looking for a Word document format of the MOU. I looked at the afwerx site and did not find it. A Word version of that would be extremely helpful to have.
A: the MOU template is available at https://afwerx.com/open-topic/ and the downloadable PDF can be converted to an editable word document.

Q5 (07/07/2022): 1) If we have a government agency interested in putting additional funds, should these funds be FY22 funds?<br />
2) What do you mean by &quot;second phase funding&quot;? Does it mean available funds after the 21 months AFWERX D2P2 contract is completed?<br />
3) If agency B provides $1M in funds, can these funds be added to the $1.25M that AFWERX will provide for a 21 month period of execution?&nbsp;
A: 1) FY22 or FY23 RDT&amp;E, or FY23 O&amp;M or Proc may be appropriate, depending on the type of work being funded. 2) second phase funding is any additional non-SBIR funding (used to be called matching funds) added to a Phase 2 contract in addition to the (up to) $1.25M SBIR funding. 3) correct!

Q6 (07/06/2022): My question is for the Direct-to-Phase II AF topic X224-ODCSO1 &hellip; topic says &ldquo;<span style=""background:white"">Solutions should be focused on the three areas listed below, meeting as many as possible.&rdquo; </span>Where are the three areas listed?
A: The three areas are the evaluation criteria, which are listed below referenced section.

Q7 (07/01/2022): Attachment 6 is a required template for the Customer Memo, and labeled as &quot;Customer Memorandum MANDATORY Template (Direct-to-Phase II Only).&quot; As this is a PDF document and not Word, it cannot be used as a dynamic template. Is the Customer Memorandum template at https://afwerx.com/open-topic/ acceptable?
A: If the word document on our website matches the solicitation attachment, then yes that is a great starting point. We believe they do match, although the requirement is to match the Customer Memorandum in the solicitation.&nbsp;

Q8 (06/29/2022): We are a non traditional provider with a technology that addresses a large number of published issues in converged data analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have any contacts in the DoD to solicit a MOU.&nbsp;&nbsp; We want to help the warfighter, how can we overcome this issue
A: The Direct-to-Phase 2 (D2P2) opportunity is focused on technical solutions with an identified customer and end user, and a signed Customer Memorandum. For technical solutions without&nbsp;an identified customer and end user, the Phase 1 (P1) opportunity may be the better approach.&nbsp;

Q9 (06/23/2022): Attachment 8 - Proposal Checklist on page 117 of the AF_x22.4_Full pdf document does not align with the Direct-to-Phase II instructions. For instance, according to the proposal checklist provided in Attachment 8, a One-page &#39;Sales Pitch&#39; Summary is required. However, a One-page &#39;Sales Pitch&#39; Summary is not listed as required within the Direct-to-Phase II instructions on page 48. Other supporting documents listed as acceptable if applicable within the Direct-to-Phase II instructions are listed as required in Attachment 8. Please clarify which Volume 5: Supporting Documents are required and which Volume 5: Supporting Documents are Acceptable for Inclusion if applicable for this Direct-to-Phase II topic.&nbsp;
A: The Proposal Checklist is provided for informational purposes only to aid offerors in preapring proposals. Offerors are expect to review and prepare proposals based on the instructions contained in the solicitation. Nothing in Attachment 8 should be taken as requiring inclusion of any documents.

Q10 (06/23/2022): For the Air Force Stakeholder and End-User requirement, we have a customer who is directly working with the Air Force and is interested in the technology that we are proposing for the Phase II for work on those projects.&nbsp; Is documenting a conversation with them about what we are proposing and their interest in in sufficient for the stakeholder requirement?&nbsp; Alternatively, would adding who they are working with in the Air Force aid that?
A: Please follow the instructions located on the Customer Memorandum attachment. Both the customer and end-user signatories must be DAF personnel.

Q11 (06/13/2022): Is &quot;Hypersonics&quot; a part of X224-ODCSO1? It is listed in Topic Details (see Modernization Priorities), but is absent&nbsp;from BAA Instructions (page 62/119, Tech Focus Areas). Please clarify if Hypersonics solutions are being considered for funding under this BAA.&nbsp;
A: This is the DAF Open Topic, so any RDT&amp;E technical solution may be proposed. We are interested in any technical area that may solve a DAF need.&nbsp;

Q12 (06/03/2022): <p style=""margin-bottom:7px"">In need of clarity regarding funding for the X224-ODCSO1 D2P2. This effort is valued at $1.25 M The instructions on the Scheduled Milestone Page states SBIR/STTR funds will not exceed $750,000.00. As I shall not seek private funding for this effort, does this mean that I must find DAF Customer funds of $499,800 to receive the full amount of $1.25 mil?
A: Please refer to amendment 3 (13 May 2022) that changed the SBIR/STTR funds to $1.25M. This is a max funding amount. The $750k is typically the max amount for a phase 2 not D2P2

Q13 (05/18/2022): We have a completed phase I that we&#39;d like to try to transition to phase II. Is it possible to do so with this topic? Or is this ONLY for projects that have never received SBIR funding?
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
For a Direct to Phase 2 (D2P2) submission, the proposal must clearly identify prior work on the solution that is similar to a feasibility study, and this prior work cannot be fully funded under a previous SBIR/STTR contract. In other words, you must identify prior feasibility efforts outside of any previous Phase I work.

Q14 (05/17/2022): Does this topic accepts a proposal for a new kind of rotor replacing existing propeller for applications such as UAS, Helicopters, or any urban air vehicle?&nbsp;Some of the advantages are higher lift capacity, speed, flight range, lower manufacturing cost, eliminating pilot error by using one control stick as opposed to 3 in the case of helicopter. The&nbsp;conceptual design and some of the theoretical studies has been completed and ready for direct to phase II.&nbsp;
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
The 22.4/D Open Topic solicitation will accept a proposal for any solution that meets a clear DAF need.

Q15 (05/12/2022): The solicitation states that demonstrating a defense need is best accomplished with a signed memo from a specific, empowered AF end-user and customer. What should be in this memo? We are familiar with the MOU that is required at the end of an AFWERX Phase I in order to be eligible for proposal submission on a Phase II. Is this the same thing, and if so, where do we get the template? If this isn&rsquo;t what is required, is there another template?
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
The &quot;signed memo&quot; is a reference to the Customer Memorandum, which must use the required template provided in the 22.4/D solicitation. Companies who completed a DAF Open Topic Phase I will have heard of this requirement, although please be sure to use the most recent template in the solicitation.

Q16 (04/30/2022): Hello, are the Open Call Direct to Phase II&#39;s still live or are they reduced to only Nuclear topics? Thanks you.
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->

This topic seeks companies with capability to complete a feasibility study and prototype validated concepts under an accelerated Phase II schedule. This topic is aimed at later stage research and development efforts rather than ""front-end"" or basic R/R&D.","The Air Force is a large and complex organization consisting of many functions with similar commercial sector counterparts. The AF is interested in exploring innovative technology domains with demonstrated clear commercial value in the non-Defense sector through existing products/solutions for potential AF applications. It is impossible to cover all technology areas with SBIR topics. Thus, this topic is a call for open ideas and technologies in areas not currently listed. It is important potential solutions have a high probability of keeping pace with technological change. They should be closely tied to commercial technologies supporting solution development. This topic is intended to identify non-Defense commercial solutions to be adapted and expanded innovatively through R/R&D to meet DoD stakeholders' needs in a short timeframe at low cost. Solutions should be focused on the three areas listed below, meeting as many as possible. Financial Sustainability - The offeror(s) should demonstrate financial sustainability for both the solution and the firm. The best solutions demonstrate this by sales to non-Defense clients and other private investment sources. Defense Need - The offeror(s) should demonstrate understanding of the fit between the solution and Defense stakeholders. The best solutions demonstrate this with a signed memo from a specific, empowered AF end-user and customer (likely not the same person) ready and willing to participate in the proposed prototype solution's trial. This should include specific objectives and measurable (quantitative) key results the proposed solution can achieve to meet AF end-user and customer needs. Technical/Team - The proposed approach's soundness, technical merit, and innovation and incremental progress toward fulfilling an AF need and the qualifications of the proposed Principal Investigators/Project Managers, supporting staff, and consultants to execute against the proposed approach. Proposals should demonstrate a product-market fit between an AF end-user and the proposed R/R&D adaptation of an existing or emerging non- Defense commercial solution. This is accomplished most effectively through a proposal with a mature non-Defense technical solution and a clear understanding of its adaptation to meet an AF customer's specific need, supported by documentation from a specific motivated, empowered AF end-user and customer ready and willing to participate in the proposed prototype solution's trial. The USAF S&T Strategy identifies five (5) Strategic Capabilities, listed below. The offeror should address the solution's connection to at least one of them. Global Persistent Awareness; Resilient Information Sharing; Rapid, Effective Decision-Making; Complexity, Unpredictability, and Mass; Speed and Reach of Disruption and Lethality. BLUE SKY* US Air Force S&T Strategy. *NOTE: While the S&T strategy document contains only five capabilities, it is possible for a solution to provide a strategic capability in a previously unconsidered area. Therefore, if the offeror feels the proposed solution does not fit within one of the listed capabilities, reference ""BLUE SKY"", including an explanation of the solution's ability to provide increased strategic capability within the context of AF, national, and global constraints. The alignment between a proposal and an S&T Strategic Capability can strengthen an application. Note, this does not change the requirement to demonstrate the Defense need, but may complement it. This also does not preclude companies looking to solve other problems not listed in the S&T Strategic Capabilities. It is simply intended to give indications of AF special emphasis areas at this time.",536,3700,1,No,No,No,,"This topic is intended for technology proven ready to move directly into Phase II. Therefore, a Phase I award is not required. The offeror is required to provide detail and documentation in the Direct to Phase II proposal which demonstrates accomplishment of a ""Phase I-like"" effort, including a feasibility study. This includes determining, insofar as possible, the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of ideas appearing to have commercial potential. It must have validated the product-market fit between the proposed solution and a potential AF stakeholder. The offeror should have defined a clear, immediately actionable plan with the proposed solution and the AF customer. The feasibility study should have: Identified the prime potential AF end user(s) for the non-Defense commercial offering to solve the AF need, i.e., how it has been modified; Described integration cost and feasibility with current mission-specific products; Described if/how the demonstration can be used by other DoD or Governmental customers.","Proposals should include development, installation, integration, demonstration and/or test and evaluation of the proposed solution prototype system. This demonstration should focus specifically on: Evaluating the proposed solution against the proposed objectives and measurable key results. Describing in detail how the installed solution differs from the non-Defense commercial offering to solve the Air Force need, as well as how it can be scaled for wide adoption, i.e., modified for scale. Identifying the proposed solution's clear transition path, taking into account input from affected stakeholders, including but not limited to, end users, engineering, sustainment, contracting, finance, legal, and cyber security. Specifying the solution's integration with other current and potential future solutions. Describing the solution's sustainability, i.e., supportability. Identifying other specific DoD or Governmental customers for the solution","Phase II solutions may transition quickly to Phase III after the product-market fit is verified. The firm will transition the adapted non-Defense commercial solution to provide expanded mission capability to a broad range of potential Government/civilian users and alternate mission applications. NOTES: Due to heavy interest in this topic, the AF will not answer questions via email, except in rare cases. Teleconferences will be held to efficiently address all questions. a. Please monitor https://af-ventures.com/ for specific telecom details. SBIR solicitations result in contracts and Other Transactions for Prototype, NOT grants. Therefore, SAM.gov registration should reflect ALL AWARDS for ""Purpose of Registration"". Firms registered to receive grants only will be ineligible. b. Registration in SAM is required to be eligible for award. Please verify the firm's CAGE code, company name, address information, DUNS numbers, etc., prior to submitting a proposal. It is the firm's responsibility to ensure the proposal and SAM.gov are consistent. c. Proposed technologies may be restricted under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) which control Defense-related materials/services import/export, or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), controlling dual use items. Offerors must review the U.S. Munitions List, https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/121.1, and provide a tentative determination regarding applicability to their proposed efforts. If determined applicable, a certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technology Agreement, must be submitted with the proposal. Information regarding the application process and instructions for form completion are found at https://www.dla.mil/HQ/LogisticsOperations/Services/JCP/DD2345Instructions/.

A: Space Force Submissions should be submitted in accordance with the Air Force Instructions X224-ODCS02; Refering to the numbers, please refer to amendment 6; All changes to amendments are specific to those sections and the rest of the RFP remains unchanged. Volume 1 identifies the overall proposal cover sheet w/required company information. 9.4.1 identifies instructions for D2P2 proposal cover sheet. Lifecycle certification is to be submitted will all D2P2 proposals.<br />
&nbsp;

Q3 (06/07/2022): I see in the solicitation that the requirement for&nbsp;X224-ODCSO1 is a 15-page white paper, but I don&#39;t see any explicit mention of&nbsp;X224-ODCSO2. Is it the same requirement, or is there a slide deck/something else we should go off of for this submission?
A: The requirements are the same please refer to Amendment 1<br />
&nbsp;

Q4 (05/09/2022): As plans have already been put in motion (e.g., resources / vacations / other efforts) around the original deadline of 02 SEPT, could the govt please shift the deadline back (from 09 AUG)?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It&#39;d be highly appreciated and help small businesses put forth the best solutions.&nbsp;<br />

Also, as a note, the due date on DSIP (the timer) is not updated &nbsp;
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Good afternoon.

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">&nbsp;

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">Air Force CSO submission deadlines are established by the Air Force SBIR office and they are who requested to have the deadline changed in the DSIP.&nbsp; Any response to this change would need to come from the Air Force SBIR office.

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">For awareness, the issue with the countdown clock was corrected and verified last week.&nbsp; The DSIP now shows the correct deadline in the documents and the countdown.

Could you recommend other areas if this is not considered a good fit?

&nbsp;
A: The Open Topic program welcomes all technology solutions that meet an Air Force or Space Force need. We do not target a specific range of TRLs or technology maturity, and welcome all submissions that can address a problem or improve operations within the DAF.&nbsp;

Q2 (06/23/2022): Attachment 5 - Proposal Checklist on page 80 of the AF_x22.D_Full pdf document does not align with the Phase I instructions. For instance, according to the proposal checklist provided in Attachment 5, a One-page &#39;Sales Pitch&#39; Summary is required. However, a One-page &#39;Sales Pitch&#39; Summary is not listed as required within the Phase I instructions on page 37. Other supporting documents listed as acceptable if applicable within the Phase I instructions are listed as required in Attachment 5. Please clarify which Volume 5: Supporting Documents are required and which Volume 5: Supporting Documents are Acceptable for Inclusion if applicable for this Phase I&nbsp;topic.&nbsp;
A: The Proposal Checklist is provided for informational purposes only to aid offerors in preapring proposals. Offerors are expect to review and prepare proposals based on the instructions contained in the solicitation. Nothing in Attachment 8 should be taken as requiring inclusion of any documents.

Q3 (06/20/2022): Greetings. The 3m Phase-1 Period of Performance suggest that the the scope is limited and. Since &quot;materials&quot; are listed as an one of the technology areas of interest, will ideas round new processing method for a material critical to many DoD applications considered?.&nbsp;&nbsp;Will this be considered &quot;front-end&quot; or &quot;basic R/R&amp;D&quot;. Or the proposal should be addressing&nbsp; a component made using this material ? Our ideas will be on a well-established materiel addressing its manufacturing/scalability for which, to the best of our knowledge, there is no commercial US manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
A: So the Open Topic Phase 1 Scope is open to any technology, solution, or application. I believe in this instance we are looking for overarching basic R&amp;D &quot;Materials and Manufacturing&quot; unless you are tying it to a focus area. Sounds like you have a great path forward!

Q4 (05/31/2022): We have reviewed the STTR Air Force X22.D instructions. In a prior Q&amp;A the Government stated that a STTR Direct to Phase II open topic was anticipated to be released mid-May. However, this document only contains topic instructions for the Phase I open topic. Will the Government consider issuing an amendment with a Direct to Phase II open topic? Thank you!
A: Direct-to-Phase-2 (D2P2) is not authorized for the STTR program, so the D2P2 solicitation is SBIR only.

Q5 (05/31/2022): The STTR Air Force X22.D instructions document provides on page 5 a link to a sample slide deck (Attachment 5). However, this link directs to a website that states that &quot;This page doesn&#39;t seem to exist.&quot;&nbsp;Will the Government please provide an updated link or provide this sample slide deck as an attachment? Thank you!
A: The link on page 5 is missing a dash before &quot;small&quot;. The correct link is <a href=""https://rt.cto.mil/rtl-small-business-resources/sbir-sttr/"">https://rt.cto.mil/rtl-small-business-resources/sbir-sttr/</a>

Q6 (05/17/2022): What is the font size requirements for the slide deck? thanks
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
There is no font size requirement for the slide decks. The solicitation only states &quot;brevity and clarity are important&quot; in regards to amount of content.

Q7 (05/09/2022): RFP section 14.2.4 Task Outline refers to other government funding commitments.&nbsp; Is at least partial funding from non-SBIR sources required for a proposal to be selected for under this D2P RFP?&nbsp;&nbsp;
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
Funding from non-SBIR sources are not required for the 22.4/D solicitation topics. The ability to add non-SBIR funding is avialable to the proposal package is an opportunity to more rapidly scale your proposed solution.

Q8 (05/03/2022): &nbsp;WesTest&#39;s dual-use prototyped technology is at TRL level 5-7.&nbsp; Our technology needs to be developed to TRL level 8-9 for DoD and commercial use.&nbsp; Is it appropriate to use this contract vehicle?&nbsp;&nbsp; We have full support of the USAF and our technology applies to all DoD services and Industry.
A: Yes, a TRL 5-7 is fine (regardless of the ultimate TRL requirement) and we invite you to participate.&nbsp;Please watch the&nbsp;<a href=""https://rt.cto.mil/rtl-small-business-resources/sbir-sttr/"">DoD SBIR/STTR Homepage</a>&nbsp;for current and upcoming announcements.

Q9 (05/02/2022): Is there an optimal TRL level our technology should be at when we submit this&nbsp;proposal to develop and commercialize it utilizing this contract vehicle? Also, on a more granular level than just Air Force and Space Force, who will be the main stakeholders/end users?
A: <style type=""text/css""><!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->
</style>
There is no TRL requirements or preferences specific to the 22.4/D solicitation. For Phase 1 contracts, the company will be required to find their stakeholders (DAF Customer and End Users), leveraging resources, connections, and networking oportunities provided during the Phase 1 execution. For Direct to Phase 2 (D2P2) contracts, the stakeholders must be identified during the proposal submission via thie Customer Memorandum.

Q10 (04/22/2022): Will the Government consider issuing&nbsp;a STTR Direct to Phase II open call as has been released for SBIR?
A: The Open Topic solicitation schedule includes a D2P2 that should release in mid-May. Please watch the <a href=""https://rt.cto.mil/rtl-small-business-resources/sbir-sttr/"">DoD SBIR/STTR Homepage</a> for updates for STTR news

Q11 (04/22/2022): Hello, wondering if you will accept water based aquatics recovery technology designed to enhance buoyancy, provide satellite tracking and location finding, communication and emergency response during SAR.&nbsp; We have a new utility patent that will redefine emergency recovery and water sustainability for professionals, veterans with disabilities and warfighters demanding more kinetic mobility in the water environment. Our systems allows additional data collection and analysis during operational assessment pre/post operation.&nbsp; This is ideal for PTAC, Forward controllers, operational warfighters flying over water and clandestine operators at the near surface level.&nbsp;&nbsp;
