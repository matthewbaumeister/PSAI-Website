# FPDS All Years - The Ultimate Dataset Guide

## üéØ Overview

You want **ALL THE DATA**! Federal contract data from 2000-2024 (25 years!) with full details.

This guide covers:
- Scale and time estimates
- Supabase capacity
- Cost implications
- Recommended strategies
- How to run it

## üìä The Numbers

### Data Scale

| Time Period | Estimated Contracts | Database Size | Scraping Time |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **2024 only** | 50,000 | ~500 MB | 7 hours |
| **2020-2024 (5 years)** | 250,000 | ~2.5 GB | 35 hours |
| **2015-2024 (10 years)** | 500,000 | ~5 GB | 70 hours (3 days) |
| **2010-2024 (15 years)** | 750,000 | ~7.5 GB | 104 hours (4.3 days) |
| **2000-2024 (25 years)** | 1,250,000 | ~12.5 GB | 174 hours (7.2 days) |

**Note:** These are estimates for 50K contracts/year. Actual volume varies by year.

## üíæ Supabase Capacity

### Free Tier
- ‚úÖ **Storage:** 500 MB (good for ~50K contracts)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not enough for multi-year

### Pro Tier ($25/month)
- ‚úÖ **Storage:** 8 GB included
- ‚úÖ **$0.125/GB** after that
- ‚úÖ Good for 10-15 years of data
- ‚úÖ Unlimited rows (PostgreSQL can handle billions)

### Estimate for Full Dataset (2000-2024)

**25 years of data:**
- Size: ~12.5 GB
- Cost: $25/month + ~$0.56/month extra storage = **~$26/month**
- One-time scraping cost: 0 (you're running it locally)

**Supabase can EASILY handle this!** PostgreSQL is built for this scale.

---

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Database Performance

**PostgreSQL (Supabase) can handle:**
- ‚úÖ Billions of rows (your 1.25M is nothing!)
- ‚úÖ Complex queries on large datasets
- ‚úÖ Fast indexed lookups
- ‚úÖ Concurrent reads/writes

**With our indexes:**
- ‚úÖ Queries on 1M+ rows: < 1 second
- ‚úÖ Company lookups: < 50ms
- ‚úÖ Filtered searches: < 2 seconds

### Query Optimization

We've already built indexes on:
- `vendor_name_key` (company matching)
- `fiscal_year` (year filtering)
- `contracting_agency_id` (agency filtering)
- `naics_code` (industry filtering)
- `data_quality_score` (quality filtering)
- `amount_category` (size filtering)

**Result:** Even with 1M+ contracts, queries are FAST!

## üéØ Recommended Strategies

### Strategy 1: Recent Years First (RECOMMENDED)
**Best for: Getting started quickly**

```bash
# Start with recent years (most relevant)
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2020 --end=2024 --max=50000
```

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ Most relevant data (recent contracts)
- ‚úÖ Better data quality (newer = cleaner)
- ‚úÖ Faster to get value (35 hours)
- ‚úÖ Can expand backwards later

**Then expand:**
```bash
# Add 2015-2019
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2015 --end=2019 --max=50000

# Add 2010-2014
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2010 --end=2014 --max=50000

# And so on...
```

---

### Strategy 2: Full Historical (7 days)
**Best for: Complete research database**

```bash
# Get EVERYTHING from 2000-2024
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2000 --end=2024 --max=50000
```

**Why:**
- ‚úÖ Complete dataset
- ‚úÖ Historical trends
- ‚úÖ Long-term analysis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Takes ~7 days

---

### Strategy 3: Targeted Years
**Best for: Specific analysis**

```bash
# Just post-COVID (2020-2024)
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2020 --end=2024

# Just Obama era (2009-2016)
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2009 --end=2016

# Just Trump era (2017-2020)
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2017 --end=2020
```

---

## üöÄ How to Run It

### Option 1: Let It Run (Simple)

```bash
# Start the scrape
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2020 --end=2024

# Walk away and let it run!
```

**Pros:** Simple
**Cons:** Stops if terminal closes

---

### Option 2: With tmux (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Start tmux session
tmux new -s fpds-all-years

# Run the scrape
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2000 --end=2024

# Detach (keeps running): Ctrl+B, then D
# Reattach later: tmux attach -t fpds-all-years
```

**Pros:** Keeps running even if you disconnect
**Cons:** Need to learn tmux (but it's easy!)

---

### Option 3: With nohup

```bash
# Run in background with logging
nohup npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2000 --end=2024 > fpds-scrape.log 2>&1 &

# Check progress
tail -f fpds-scrape.log

# Check if still running
ps aux | grep fpds
```

**Pros:** Survives terminal close, logs output
**Cons:** Can't interact with it

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimates by Year Range

| Years | Period | Contracts | Time | Cost |
|-------|--------|-----------|------|------|
| **5** | 2020-2024 | 250K | 1.5 days | $25/mo |
| **10** | 2015-2024 | 500K | 3 days | $25/mo |
| **15** | 2010-2024 | 750K | 4.3 days | $26/mo |
| **20** | 2005-2024 | 1M | 5.8 days | $27/mo |
| **25** | 2000-2024 | 1.25M | 7.2 days | $28/mo |

**Your machine:** Running 24/7 for the duration
**Your involvement:** Check progress occasionally

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Start Over the Weekend

Start Friday evening, it'll be done by next Friday.

### 2. Monitor Progress

```bash
# Check database count in Supabase
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_contracts,
  fiscal_year,
  COUNT(*) as year_count
FROM fpds_contracts
GROUP BY fiscal_year
ORDER BY fiscal_year DESC;
```

### 3. Resume If Interrupted

The scraper works by quarters, so if it crashes:
- Check which year/quarter failed
- Re-run just that year
- It will upsert (update existing, add new)

### 4. Check Data Quality During Scrape

```sql
-- Quick quality check
SELECT * FROM fpds_data_quality_summary;

-- Check by year
SELECT 
  fiscal_year,
  COUNT(*) as contracts,
  AVG(data_quality_score) as avg_quality
FROM fpds_contracts
GROUP BY fiscal_year
ORDER BY fiscal_year DESC;
```

### 5. Upgrade Supabase to Pro First

If scraping > 5 years, upgrade to Pro ($25/mo) BEFORE starting:
- More storage (8 GB included)
- Better performance
- No interruptions

---

## üé¨ Recommended Workflow

### Week 1: Recent Years
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2020 --end=2024 --max=50000
```
- ‚è±Ô∏è 1.5 days
- üíæ ~2.5 GB
- ‚úÖ Get immediate value

### Week 2: Check & Expand
- Build some queries
- Test UI components
- If everything looks good, expand:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2015 --end=2019 --max=50000
```

### Week 3+: Historical
- Add earlier years as needed
- Or go for broke with 2000-2024!

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Out of storage"
Upgrade to Supabase Pro or reduce `--max` per year

### "Connection timeout"
The scraper has retry logic. Just let it keep running.

### "Process killed"
Your machine ran out of memory. Reduce `--max` or add more RAM.

### "How do I know it's still running?"
```bash
# Check process
ps aux | grep fpds

# Check database count
# (Should increase every few minutes)
```

---

## üìà What You Can Do With All This Data

### 1. Historical Trends
```sql
SELECT 
  fiscal_year,
  COUNT(*) as contracts,
  SUM(current_total_value_of_award) as total_value,
  AVG(current_total_value_of_award) as avg_value
FROM fpds_contracts
GROUP BY fiscal_year
ORDER BY fiscal_year;
```

### 2. Company History
```sql
-- Every contract IBM ever got
SELECT * FROM fpds_contracts
WHERE vendor_name_key = 'IBM'
ORDER BY fiscal_year DESC;
```

### 3. Industry Evolution
```sql
-- AI/ML contracts over time
SELECT 
  fiscal_year,
  COUNT(*) as contracts,
  SUM(current_total_value_of_award) as total_value
FROM fpds_contracts
WHERE naics_code = '541715'
GROUP BY fiscal_year
ORDER BY fiscal_year;
```

### 4. Small Business Trends
```sql
SELECT 
  fiscal_year,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE small_business = true) as small_biz_contracts,
  COUNT(*) as total_contracts,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE small_business = true) / COUNT(*), 2) as small_biz_pct
FROM fpds_contracts
GROUP BY fiscal_year
ORDER BY fiscal_year;
```

## üéâ Bottom Line

**Supabase can EASILY handle ALL years of FPDS data!**

- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL is built for this
- ‚úÖ Your indexes make queries fast
- ‚úÖ Cost is minimal (~$25-30/month)
- ‚úÖ 1M+ rows is totally normal for Postgres

**Recommended Start:**
```bash
# Recent years (1.5 days)
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2020 --end=2024
```

**Go Big:**
```bash
# All years (7 days)
tmux new -s fpds-scraper
npx tsx src/scripts/fpds-full-load-multi-year.ts --start=2000 --end=2024
# Ctrl+B, then D to detach
```

**You'll have the most comprehensive federal contract database available!** üöÄ
