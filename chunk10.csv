Q7 (12/08/2021): Q. 1 Please confirm whether ithis solicitation is for phase 1 or Direct to Phase 2 ?
A: This is a Phase 1 topic.

Q8 (12/03/2021): What kind of &quot;complex minefield information&quot; will be provided to train ML algorithms? Is the data labeled or unlabeled?&nbsp;
A: We are currently plan to do detection with EOIR sensors. In the future we want to be able to different sensors and would like the rout planning to still work. We will be able to provide lots of information about Minefield setup but in the real world each is different. What we are hoping for is an algorithm that will help us plan a rout through the minefield even with incomplete detection data.

Q9 (12/01/2021): 1. How is this going to be used?

2. What is the country of origin for mines / IEDs / battlefield hazards?

3. What types of mines / IEDs? Anti-tank, Anti-vehicle, Anti-personnel?

&nbsp;
A: 1.&nbsp;We plan to use this to help our autonomous and semi-autonomous ground systems plan a path through a minefield that requires the least time and/or the fewest encounters with mines that have to be neutralized

2.&nbsp;We expect to encounter mines from anywhere in the world, major manufacturers include but are not limited to Russia, China, Iran, Italy, Bulgaria, etc

3.&nbsp;In this effort we are focusing on Anti-tank/Anti-vehicle mines

Q10 (12/01/2021): What type(s) of sensors will provide the data proceed by the AI/ML algorithms?&nbsp; Will the data be in the form of images?&nbsp; If not, how is the sensor data structured?
A: Currently we are planning on using EOIR sensors and some of that data can be provided. However, the sensing technology may change in the future so we would like the route planning to be sensor agnostic

Q11 (11/30/2021): Can you provide additional information on the&nbsp;format and content of verified data sets to be used in algorithm training (we are assuming this data set will be provided to us). Thank you!

German Nunez

(303) 408 3997
A: We currently use EOIR sensors to collect data. This may not always be true as significant R&amp;D is going into improved sensing for mine targets. We would like the rout planning algorithm to be sensor agnostic. The current EOIR data is on individual mines not minefields. We will be able to provide significant information about minefield setup and construction.

Q12 (11/30/2021): Will any data be provided to support R&amp;D under this effort?
A: We will attempt to provide any data that is requested. Currently we can likely provide sensor data from EOIR sensors and information about minefield construction and planning.",,"Battlespace, Information Systems",2,Battlespace,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning,1,Automated intelligence; machine learning; data analysis; threat detection,4,Automated intelligence,No,0,No,,"This program aims to improve the Explosive Breacher (EB) by closing capability gaps in current breaching techniques left by quickly evolving adversarial technology and aging legacy equipment.Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms will be trained to identify obstacle locations within a minefield.

Legacy breaching equipment, such as MICLIC, is no longer effective against quickly evolving adversarial technology and can be time consuming to deploy. AI/ML will be used to identify explosive obstacles, route through minefields, and create efficient firing plans for breaching technology. AI/ML can analyze data and create solutions more quickly and accurately than personnel with the same information.

A: 

Q13 (11/22/2021): Is it desired that the system be able to&nbsp;<em>learn</em>&nbsp;previously unknown modulation patterns, or rather that the system be able to just recognize when a new signal has a modulation that does not represent one of the known classes?

PM IS&A products will empower the intel analyst by providing them with access to critical data/information and advanced analytics. NLP is a critical capability for PM IS&A products that is necessary to make sense of large amounts of unstructured data from multiple unclassified and classified sources. Unfortunately, today's technology struggles at adequately addressing this problem. This should be done by reducing the cognitive load on the intel analyst, improving situational awareness and situational understanding for the war fighter and intel analyst, addressing gaps in the existing NLP technologies, and improving data fusion and pattern recognition and analysis tools that are used for intelligence applications. Currently, information is manually extracted by people. Today, intel analysts spend half of their time looking for the golden nugget in massive amounts of data sets by using a mixture of techniques and tools. Today's NLP technologies excel at very specific tasks such as identifying attributes and extracting attributes from entities (not correlating back to either other). We propose developing AI/ML models to help augment the NLP technologies.

A: Vendors will be responsible for administering and collecting data as part of the platform trial.

Q2 (12/15/2021): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Regarding your answer from the 12/12/21 response about the three 60-day &ldquo;realistic use conditions,&rdquo; is it safe to assume there is no period of performance to configure the desired solution based on the SBIR requirements?
A: In seeking the most complete and applicable solutions available, we understand existing systems may not meet 100% of desired topic goals. Our intent is for vendors to propose their most applicable work. If selected, and your team has the capability, it is likely possible to implement feedback from the first trial period into the system for evaluation in the other two trials.

Q3 (12/15/2021): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Due to holiday season, may we receive an extension to Jan 07, 2022?
A: Unfortunately extensions are not available.

Q4 (12/15/2021): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Due to an absence of a Phase 1, What is expected in the Feasibility Documents section?
A: Since this is a direct to phase 2 topic, it is expected that companies submitting a proposal will have at least some work towards a working system. Provided that work is not the direct and unaltered/unmodified result of a previous SBIR funded effort, the efforts outlining the functionality of your system could count toward feasibility.

Q5 (12/15/2021): <p style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">The documentation says 60-day evaluation and 90-day test.&nbsp; Is it correct that this will take place within the 6-month Phase II and that the 60 days is for the real-life evaluation and the remaining 30 days is to compile feedback and report?
A: The 90 day test is a typo. The evaluation period will be three 60 day periods, one at each site (Ft. Jackson, Ft. Stewart, Ft. Bragg), approx 6mo total.

Q6 (12/15/2021): The SBIR 21.4 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) states, &quot;For Phase II/DP2, a minimum of one-half (50%) of the research and/or analytical work must be performed by the proposing firm. The percentage of work is measured by both direct and indirect costs.&quot; We have seen conflicting guidance on how specifically to calculate the 50% threshold. For example, some portions of the guidance say that fee should be taken out before doing the calculation, while others say travel and other overhead costs should not be part of the calculation. Can you provide or point to definitive guidance for what is and is not included in this 50% calculation?&nbsp;
A: The 50% is taken after fees, etc. More details can be found here:&nbsp;https://www.sbir.gov/tutorials/preparing-proposal/tutorial-4#

Specifically, the 3rd paragraph on page 2 is most relevant to your questions.

Q7 (12/14/2021): DoD proposal&nbsp;submissions often allow for a Glossary and Table of Contents in the tech volume that do not count against the page limit.

A: Those items would count against the 15 page limit.

Q8 (12/14/2021): What is the page limit for the technical volume? The&nbsp;first page of&nbsp;the DP2&nbsp;template mentions a&nbsp;15-page white paper, yet on the second page under the formatting instructions, it says the white paper should not exceed 10 pages.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
A: The overall white paper length is 15 pages for phase 2/DP2.

Q9 (12/13/2021): The SBO refers to an optional slide deck and states that a template is attached.&nbsp; Where can this template be found?&nbsp;

Q10 (12/12/2021): Please confirm the POP is 6 months&nbsp;of which a 90 day experiment will be conducted and the 60 day &ldquo;Realistic Use Conditions&rdquo; will fall within that 90 day experiment period.
A: There will not be a 90 day period. The POP is 6 months, consisting of three 60 day &quot;realistic use conditions&quot; testing periods where Soldiers will test/use your solution. Awardees will have the ability to travel to each of the groups to gather feedback on functions/improvements/UI/UX, etc.

Q11 (12/12/2021): <i>Would the Government confirm that the Agency Supplemental OCI policy in Section 3.7, Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI), of the SBIR 21.4 BAA SBO prohibits concurrent SETA or A&amp;AS support only where the concurrent work may create an OCI under the FAR?&nbsp; Would the Government further affirm that it intends the proposer and any team members to disclose SETA, A&amp;AS or similar work only where it may intersect with the scope of this vehicle?&nbsp;</i>
A: The Vendor has a requirement&nbsp;(per the BAA) to state whether&nbsp;or not they have a OCI and if they do they see a potential for&nbsp;OCI then they would have to submit a mitigation plan for the Government to review. I would advise the company to disclose SETA, A&amp;AS or similar work where it applies to the BAA.&nbsp; The Government will evaluate the companies OCI mitigation plans to avoid, neutralize or mitigate potential OCI issues before award and to determine whether it is in the Government&rsquo;s interest to grant a waiver.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

If the Government determines that a proposer failed to fully disclose an OCI; or failed to provide the affirmation of Army support as described above; or failed to reasonably provide additional information requested by the Government to assist in evaluating the proposer&rsquo;s OCI mitigation plan, the Government may reject the proposal and withdraw it from consideration for award.

A: The Vendor has a requirement&nbsp;(per the BAA) to state whether&nbsp;or not they have a OCI and if they do they see a potential for&nbsp;OCI then they would have to submit a mitigation plan for the Government to review. I would advise the company to disclose SETA, A&amp;AS or similar work where it applies to the BAA.&nbsp; The Government will evaluate the companies OCI mitigation plans to avoid, neutralize or mitigate potential OCI issues before award and to determine whether it is in the Government&rsquo;s interest to grant a waiver.&nbsp;

Q13 (12/10/2021): There are roughly 4000 users per population that will be in the test periods. &nbsp;Will the users be provided prior to the test period for account creation, or are we to assume that the users will not be &lsquo;known&rsquo; to the solution prior to the test period and that they will have to self-provision at the start of our 2-month engagement period with a particular brigade?
A: User information will not be provided prior to the beginning of the testing phases. Onboarding users onto platforms should begin at the start of each testing period.

Q14 (12/10/2021): The DSIP portal has a section in Volume 5 which has a place to upload (See image attached):&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li><b>Funding Agreement Certificatoin</b></li>
	<li><b>Lifecycle&nbsp;Certification</b></li>
	<li><b>Allocation of Rights</b></li>
</ul>

I do not see these&nbsp;referenced in the solicitation&nbsp;and want to confirm that they are NOT required to be uploaded into the DSIP portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A: The uploading of those documents is the prerogative of the company. It is not required to have those in order to be&nbsp;evaluated. However, if you are&nbsp;selected, you&nbsp;will likely need to provide them for contracting purposes.

Q15 (12/09/2021): <ul>
	<li>Was this solicitation created with pre-existing companies in mind, in particular ones that have a pre-existing relationship with DoD?</li>
	<li>What is the weight of &quot;previous commercial success&quot; in evaluating proposals? For example, if there is a functioning prototype in use that satisfies the requirements and more,&nbsp;is&nbsp;ready-to-go as well as&nbsp;designed for commercial use, to what extent is it worth applying&nbsp;if this is from an early stage startup ?</li>
</ul>
A: Since this is a SBIR topic, for-profit concerns only may apply. Newly formed companies can apply, provided they meet the eligibility requirements.&nbsp;A pre-existing relationship with the DoD is NOT required, nor was the topic created with this in mind.

Previous commercial success is to give reviewers a picture of the ability of companies to commercialize an existing product. The reviewers also recognize that past commercial success is not necessarily an indicator of future success. The commercialization section should outline commercialization plans&nbsp;specifically for&nbsp;this topic as its main focus.

Q16 (12/09/2021): In the Foreign Disclosure Addendum, the Employees Section, question 5 states &quot;Does your company hire interns, temporary employees, or employees not considered full-time employees? Please also provide resumes and/or CVs for these individuals.&quot;&nbsp;

Is this for foreign nationals or for US Citizens as well?
A: Those items are required for this section only in the case that interns, temporary, or part-time employees are foreign persons.

Q17 (12/09/2021): 1. What security level is required for data storage? Is IL2 sufficient for this project?

2. Are existing consumer wearable devices acceptable for use?
A: IL2 should be sufficient, certain protocols that would be required for higher levels would not necessarily be available for some mobile devices, etc.

Wearables are not the focus of the testing phase, and should not be included in current plans. However, if your platform has a unique wearable/capability, you might include a short section in your proposal only describing those unique capabilities in relation to project goals and how it could be implemented in a future phase.

Q18 (12/09/2021): &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Question Submitted On: 11/30/2021

An answer was posted today that creates confusion. On 11/30/21 a question was asked about the ability to integrate with existing government databases such as Vantage, AWS GovCloud, Cloud 1, etc.&nbsp; The answer posted by the government said, &quot;The phase 2 performance period will include hands-on testing of your platform by Soldiers. In terms of government database integration, familiarity with at least one of those listed is desired.&quot;

The key here is the phrase, &quot;familiarity with at least one of those listed is desired.&quot;

On 12/07/21 a follow-up question was posted asking if the ability for an existing commercial product to integrate with AWS GovCloud met the requirement. Note that the government had just released an answer stating that &quot;familiarity&quot; was &quot;desired&quot;.

Today the government responded to the 12/07/21 question and states, &quot;The phase II testing period will require integration with one or more of these systems, and AWS gov cloud would meet that requirement.&quot;&nbsp;

Would the government please clarify what level of integration MUST be demonstrated by a mobile app during the Phase II period? The solicitation does not specify an integration. The first Q&amp;A by the government said that familiarity was desired....but today we are now being told that integration with a representative system MUST be demonstrated during the phase II. What is the requirement? What level of &quot;demonstration&quot; is the minimum standard?
A: Apologies for the confusing answer. We&#39;ve had some internal discussions recently about proper guidance here. In short, the Army would need access to the data following the trial period. This could be accomplished by integrating with one (or more) of the systems listed, or alternatively solvers could host data themselves. In the event solvers would host the data, it would need to be turned over to the Army following the testing phases.

Q19 (12/08/2021): The solicitation contains cost/budget guidance for travel costs. There is no guidance regarding software licensing costs. Does the Army desire companies to provide the software free of charge for purposes of evaluation, or should proposals include software license costs for up to 4700 concurrent users for a six month period?
A: Licensing costs should be included in the cost volume based on number and duration of users during the testing phases.

</ul>
A: The most complete solution would address all 5 pillars, however we recognize that not all companies will have material for all five. We cannot prescribe a ranking or priority between the five.

There are a variety of groups that will experience the platform differently, there is no designation for a primary group.

The most complete solution will bring their expertise in this field in as many of the 5 pillars as possible. Some adjustment is likely based on varying needs of different Army units.

In regards to readiness, spiritual and mental readiness, and spiritual practice, treatment of these pillars is left to the approach of the company, their platform, and SMEs.

There is not currently a widespread way for leaders to understand physical/performance states of their soldiers as it pertains to readiness of the force. Part of the goals for this topic include implementing a way to understand the holistic health and fitness of a unit in a way that is easy and intuitive. Current data is limited in scope and detail and in some cases is presented only as pass/fail criteria.

There is not an enterprise-level social network for the Army. Units will often have social activities or FRGs, but this varies from unit to unit.

The success of behavioral interventions is likely highly dependent upon the individual and their willingness/openness to address issues as they arise. Specific requirements should be handled by those medical professionals within the Army community. However, it could be within scope of this topic to ask soldiers to participate in self-reflection and seek help if they feel it would be useful/beneficial.

Adoption of the platform for this testing phase is highly encouraged and the three units participating have done so on a volunteer basis. One of the goals of the topic is to put forth a platform that encourages compliance with positive and intuitive UI/UX. How this is accomplished is left to the creativity of the solvers.

Education levels across units of all types will vary. It is not unheard of for enlisted soldiers to seek/possess graduate degrees, for example.

For this testing phase, we envision soldiers, practitioners, etc. could use this platform on mobile devices and/or laptop/desktop computers.

Gaming strictly for entertainment purposes would likely be restricted to soldiers&#39; personal time. In relation to gamified modules relating to the 5 pillars/platform, this should not be restricted nor considered &#39;entertainment&#39;. Use of gamified modules would be up to the discretion of the solvers as it would pertain to the use, functionality, and goals of the provided platform.

The Army is concerned with accountability and integrity, and they are a high priority in building unit cohesiveness and trust between soldiers. However beyond things like attendance, job performance (OERs, NCOERs, etc.), there is not an enterprise system solution. Priorities may vary by unit.

Use and integration of qualitative data will be up to the platform/SMEs and outlined in the submitted proposal.

The most complete solution will bring the ability to make&nbsp;recommendations and processing/analytics, however it is likely that at some stage, collaboration with Army leaders will be necessary to adjust certain parameters/protocols.

The role of group dynamics could be up to your creativity/approach and how inclusion of these parameters would fit into your platform and the overall goals of the topic.

Q22 (12/07/2021): The stated award value is up to $500K with a PoP of 6 months.&nbsp; DSIP&#39;s Vol.II (Cost Vol) offers a total budget of $1,500,000.&nbsp; Does this imply that an Offerer may secure and present matching funds?
A: The award is $500k to each of three awardees (for a $1.5M total). Additional matched funds are not offered on this topic.

Q23 (12/07/2021): The provided D2P2 template describes the FEASIBILITY DOCUMENTS section and states that &quot;Documentation should include all relevant information including, but not limited to: technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results.&quot; The A214-052 SBIR topic says that &quot;DIRECT-TO-PHASE-II proposals must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility described in the Phase I section of this topic has been met and describe the potential commercial applications of the solution. This could be accomplished through the proper demonstration of any viable athlete management system that meets the listed capabilities.&quot; Can you please clarify the expectations for the Feasibility Documents section as pertains to this specific opportunity? To what extent is technical data expected in the Phase II proposal submission in order to validate feasibility?<br />
&nbsp;
A: It is usually helpful to be as detailed as possible when describing your solution, so that reviewers can have the best understanding possible of your platform. The intent of the feasibility section is for you to show that your solution would work if applied to this topic, and goes some way toward explaining how.&nbsp;

Q24 (12/07/2021): The pre-release draft solicitation Section 4.1 of &quot;&ldquo;Army BAA 21.4 Rev 3&rdquo; states, &ldquo;Feasibility documentation cannot be based upon any prior or ongoing federally funded SBIR or STTR work and DP2 proposals MUST NOT logically extend from any prior or ongoing federally funded SBIR or STTR work.&rdquo;&nbsp; During our informal pre-release discussions were were informed that work performed under unrelated SBIRs for components other than the Army could be cited to demonstrate Phase I feasibility. We note that the &nbsp;language precluding reference to other SBIRs does not appear in the final solicitation. Can the government confirm that previous DoD SBIR human performance efforts with other services (i.e. Navy, Air Force) may be cited in a proposal to satisfactorily demonstrate the Phase I SBIR feasibility requirement?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
A: The intent of that guideline is to prevent the submission of duplicative work for more than one award. Work submitted to other SBIRs (DoD or other) is eligible to be submitted in this direct to phase 2 proposal for feasibility purposes provided that it did not 100% result from that previous effort. Demonstration/discussion of how the work to be submitted has progressed or is different from the previous work will satisfy this stipulation.

Q25 (12/07/2021): During the Phase II Soldiers will be testing the product. Based on our pre-release informal conversations&nbsp;our understanding is that the Army expects the nature of the research in Phase II to be limited to program effectiveness. As such,&nbsp;the Phase II effort planned by the Army will NOT trigger&nbsp;&ldquo;Human Subject Research&rdquo; protocols that would necessitate an IRB. &nbsp;Please confirm this and clarify whether the vendor will be required to obtain any Human Subject Research approvals for the Phase II effort.
A: We do not anticipate the need for Human Subject Research nor IRB protocols.

Q26 (12/07/2021): During the 11/10/2021 industry day a participant asked if it was permissible to include a marketing or informational video in Volume 5 of the submission. We see no reference to inclusion of a video in any of the solicitation documents. Could the Army clarify whether a video is required, desired, or optional? If one can be submitted what format, length, and content guidelines should be followed?&nbsp;
A: It would be possible to include a link to a hosted video in the proposal or supplemental slides, however we ask that these materials not contain marketing/sales materials as they would not be within the scope of the proposal. Video or any other supplemental materials are not required. Format and content should be tailored to strengthen the overall proposal or give additional details to specific elements of the proposal.

Q27 (12/07/2021): In a previous Q&amp;A on this topic the Army was asked about the requirement to demonstrate,&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;the ability to integrate with existing government databases such (i.e. Vantage, AWS GovCloud, Cloud 1, other accredited cloud services from the Department of Defense)&rdquo; and whether or not there was a requirement to demonstrate this ability during the Phase II Soldier touchpoint. The Army responded that the Phase II performance period will include hands-on testing by Soldiers, and that in terms of government database integration, familiarity with at least one of the systems is desired.

Follow-up clarification questions:

1) Is the &quot;familiarity with at least one of those listed&quot; sufficiently met with discussion in our proposal, or is there some level of familiarity test required during the Phase II execution?

2)&nbsp;For a Direct to Phase II submission does the ability of the existing commercial product to integrate with AWS GovCloud meet the requirement? &nbsp;

3) Given that the solution will eventually require an Authority To Operate (ATO) for use on government networks, what level of ATO readiness is expected to be attained and/or demonstrated during the Phase II period?

&nbsp;
A: The phase II testing period will require integration with one or more of these systems, and AWS gov cloud would meet that requirement. As for ATO, specifics are still being worked out and will be communicated when available.

Q28 (12/07/2021): The Army A214_052 document identifies a key capability for, &ldquo;Ability to deliver coaching for all five H2F domains, along with automatic recommendations to individual users based on thresholds established by practitioners.&quot; &nbsp; Does the Army desire these thresholds to be generic or specifically prescribed by a practitioner?
A: If possible, solvers should bring as much expertise as they can in each of the domains. However, it should be possible for Army practitioners to modify thresholds in the system according to unit needs. In other words,&nbsp;the ability to provide recommendations/coaching is important, however the platform should also support Army leaders/practitioners changing/implementing&nbsp;protocols as deemed necessary.

Q29 (12/07/2021): The Army A214_052 document identifies a key capability for an &ldquo;Easy to use solution that can be downloaded on a mobile device with web-based capability for access on a computer.&quot; &nbsp; Does the Army anticipate use on personal or government mobile devices? If on a government device are there specific Mobile Device Management solutions that must be accommodated? Are the computers referenced expected to be on a government network? If so, does the Army expect to issue an exception or a waiver that will allow for commercial software to be used on government networks during the Phase II period?
A: Anticipated use could encompass both personal devices (mobile phone, laptop, etc.) as well as government hardware. If needed for use on government hardware, we will coordinate with appropriate IT to garner access.

Q30 (12/07/2021): The Army A214_052 document identifies a key capability for, &ldquo;Functionality for automatic emails and notifications based on defined data triggers.&quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the Phase II period will the Army make official Army email address available to demonstrate this functionality?
A: During onboarding, users will input an email address of their choice, official Army or other, at their preference.&nbsp;

Q31 (12/06/2021): RE: A214-052&nbsp;Holistic Health and Fitness Management System&nbsp;

Would a rapid point of care Cortisol (stress) diagnostic test using any smartphone conform to this solicitation?.&nbsp; Cortisol production is critical to all the health factors listed in the topic including:&nbsp;athlete management system, AMS, physical fitness, cognitive wellness, spiritual readiness, mental readiness, nutrition tracking, sleep tracking, sleep wellness, health intervention protocol, human performance, performance measurements, physical training, physical fitness, wellness.

This is a handheld system that can use any smartphone and is a saliva-based test completed in minutes. In lieu of treatment, all warfighters would be tested at baseline and in different stressful situations.&nbsp; The system graphs the results longitudinally for short and long-term tracking and provides real time data upon each test administered. This data can be utilized as the basis for each of the holistic parameters in this topic.&nbsp;

The app (iOS/Android) and test are completed and our Phase I would be to build out the app/website to include parameters for all of the items in the topic.

&nbsp;
A: For this DP2 topic, hardware is not within the scope of the testing/feedback portion involving soldier use/touchpoints. However, if you believe you have an innovative hardware device, you could dedicate a small portion of your technical volume&nbsp;(keeping in mind the main targets/focus of the topic) to that device.

Q32 (12/03/2021): Given that it is a Direct to Phase II only, but the topic paper document linked to the BAA mentions multiple phases, should&nbsp;we not include a Phase I exploratory portion of our proposal?&nbsp;
A: The descriptions for each phase are given to illustrate what activity would take place at each phase. For this DP2 topic, one of the&nbsp;goals of the proposal is to discuss&nbsp;your methods of&nbsp;how you have completed the activities given in the phase 1 section, and/or how any small deficiencies are/will be addressed.

Q33 (12/03/2021): Given that it is a Direct to Phase II only, but the&nbsp;topic paper document linked to the BAA mentions multiple phases, should we not include a Phase I exploratory portion of our proposal?&nbsp;
A: The descriptions for each phase are given to illustrate what activity would take place at each phase. For this DP2 topic, one of the&nbsp;goals of the proposal is to discuss&nbsp;your methods of&nbsp;how you have completed the activities given in the phase 1 section, and/or how any small deficiencies are/will be addressed.

Q34 (12/02/2021): Who is the best person to reach out to about this project?&nbsp;
A: The direct communication, pre-solicitation period ended on 1 DEC. For the remainder of the Q&amp;A period, this SITIS board is the best place to interact with TPOC(s) and answers to further questions.

Q35 (12/02/2021): On the first page of the Foreign Disclosure Addendum, a required attachment&nbsp;in Volume 5, my team had two questions about Question 2 written as: &quot;Does/did your company or employees have relationships with any foreign academic institutions, research centers, or affiliated academic organizations over the past seven (7) years?&quot;

Our questions:<br />
1) It says &quot;academic institutions, research centers&quot; - does that mean &quot;academic institutions or academic research centers&quot; or &quot;academic institutions or any research centers&quot;.&nbsp;<br />
2) Does &quot;relationship&quot; mean as a student, as a fellow, or as an employee?<br />
&nbsp;

Thank you!
A: This question is trying to determine your relationship (academic, professional, business, including student/fellow/employee) with any foreign research. This would include academic institutions, schools, universities, etc. as well as any public or privately run research institutions.

Q36 (12/02/2021): Thank you for the opportunity to submit questions. MAJ Rinaldi provided us the webinar links and we have listened a few times.&nbsp;Two women-owned companies experts in IT (8a &amp; HUBZone and Wellness (HUBZone) have these two clarifying questions please:

1.&nbsp;Is the government looking to buy a commercial solution (as it referenced&nbsp;in one section) for 500k that meets their criteria or are they looking to pay for the development of a system that would fit their requirements like a glove.&nbsp;

2. Is this strictly IT development/architecture, or IT development/architecture with recommended wellness solutions focused on the holistic dimensions mentioned?&quot;

We have separately developed customized IT architecture for the Joint Chiefs and established the Shared Services strategy for Johnson &amp; Johnson for every dollar invested an $8.5 return.&nbsp;

We look forward to receiving your response. With appreciation.&nbsp;

&nbsp;
A: We are looking for the most complete solutions possible, recognizing that some minimal development could be needed to help tailor the existing product to more fully meet the needs outlined in the proposal. Being a direct to phase 2 topic, the proposal would need to include feasibility and discussion of how the platform already meets as many of the goals as possible outlined in the phase I/II sections. Complete solutions will also have the ability of the platform to make recommendations of their fitness/wellness experts (in as many of the 5 areas as possible) in collaboration with Army experts to improve performance.

Q37 (12/01/2021): Is this a direct-to-Phase II topic or a Phase I topic, or will both types of proposals be accepted?
A: This topic will accept direct to phase 2 proposals only.

Q38 (12/01/2021): Is the Army only interested in Direct-to-Phase II responses for this Topic? Or are Phase I responses also being accepted?
A: This topic is open to direct to phase 2 proposals only.

Q39 (12/01/2021): Does the ARMY have a preference regarding the data management system, such as SQL, MySQL, NoSQL etc.?

Can data be stored together with the name of the soldier, or should it be anonymized and/or encrypted?
A: Provided the platform can integrate with Army systems (AWS, and others in the solicitation) easily, a specific preference for solution platform architecture has not been announced. As for data anonymization, key capabilities #2 asks for aggregated data anonymized for leaders at higher levels.

Q40 (11/30/2021): Are foreign national subcontracts/partners allowed on the proposals?
A: In brief, foreign national subcontractors are allowed, however certain guidelines must be met, including that their work/contribution must be performed in the US. More info is found here:&nbsp;https://www.sbir.gov/sites/all/themes/sbir/dawnbreaker/img/documents/Course1-Tutorial2.pdf

Q41 (11/30/2021): Pg 4 states...&quot;ease of programming at the coach level for all five domains, the ability to integrate with existing government databases such (i.e. Vantage, AWS GovCloud, Cloud 1, other accredited cloud services from the Department of Defense&quot;.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it the intention of the government to demonstrate this ability during the Phase II Soldier touchpoint?
A: The phase 2 performance period will include hands-on testing of your platform by Soldiers. In terms of government database integration, familiarity with at least one of those listed is desired.

Q42 (11/30/2021): A214-052&nbsp;

1.&nbsp; Do we need to show all requirements for Phase I, though we are applying for Phase II?

2.&nbsp; Do we &quot;have&quot; to have a detailed Commercialization Plan?&nbsp; Or just complete the technical details in the form?

3.&nbsp; Are resumes part of the 15 pages?
A: We are looking for the most &quot;complete&quot; solution to be provided, however we recognize that the elements outlined may not all exist in a tailor-made package at this time. The goal of proposals for DP2 should be to show how you have completed as many of the phase 1 requirements as possible. You are strongly encouraged to give careful consideration to each of the 3 proposal components: technical volume, commercialization, and personnel. It is up to you if you would like to include entire resumes or smaller highlights of your team members. This can be done in the personnel section of the proposal with the option of including additional/detailed information in the optional slide deck if page limits are a concern.",,Information Systems,1,Information Systems,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning | Biotechnology,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning | Biotechnology,2,"Human performance optimization, HPO, Holistic health and fitness, H2F, athlete management system, AMS, physical fitness, cognitive wellness, spiritual readiness, mental readiness, nutrition tracking, sleep tracking, sleep wellness, health intervention protocol, human performance, performance measurements, physical training, physical fitness, wellness.",1,"Human performance optimization, HPO, Holistic health and fitness, H2F, athlete management system, AMS, physical fitness, cognitive wellness, spiritual readiness, mental readiness, nutrition tracking, sleep tracking, sleep wellness, health intervention protocol, human performance, performance measurements, physical training, physical fitness, wellness.",Yes,1,Yes,,"Implement athlete management system (AMS) in the field to further develop, demonstrate, and deliver a solution for a Soldier Readiness interface tool that collects data from all five domains of the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System.",37,"Implement athlete management system (AMS) in the field to further develop, demonstrate, and deliver a solution for a Soldier Readiness interface tool that collects data from all five domains of the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System.","People First and Soldier Readiness are top priorities for Army senior leaders, however the technical tools used to evaluate readiness are not comprehensive, lack the ability to assist Soldiers in improving in areas of weakness, and are unable to provide leadership snapshots of the readiness level of their force. The Army uses the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) domains to evaluate and improve readiness. The domains are physical fitness, sleep, nutrition, mental, and spiritual readiness, all of which define Soldier readiness in qualitative and quantitative metrics. Currently those metrics are disparate and are collected in a myriad of different tools, surveys, and subjective analysis from experts which are often analog in nature. Consolidating and simplifying the method in which we collect data for H2F domains in order to deliver interventions and drive performance across the force would enable leaders to methodically improve readiness over time. Ideally, the data collected would build a holistic performance picture of each Soldier over time and stay with them through various units across the Army to build upon performance throughout their career. The emphasis placed on these readiness domains varies. Soldiers conduct physical training on a daily basis but are not logging efforts, often have non-congruent fitness programs not tailored to individual needs, and are lacking education on how to conduct exercise/movements correctly. Sleep and nutrition are not routinely monitored, with most education efforts usually occurring in mass groups or only for those deemed at performance risk. Spiritual and mental readiness are left to personnel that are in short supply (the Soldier to professional ratio is 4000:1 in the cognitive and sleep specialities, and 500:1 in the spiritual domain)), and individual assistance is reactive rather than proactive, only coming after a soldier is far down a path and requires practitioner intervention. These domains are further described in FM 7-22, Holistic Health and Fitness, (October 2020).Soldier data across these five domains is usually logged locally on an excel sheet or written journal and only physical fitness data is collected (1 of 5 domains). Soldiers move to different units in the active component every 2-3 years and change positions frequently. During most transitions, the data described in H2F domains (aside from twice yearly physical fitness tests) is lost making it hard for Soldiers to improve above baseline performance. In addition, the lack of a cohesive system for data collection and display makes it difficult for leaders to understand the readiness level of their force and identify Soldiers who may be struggling before they fail a physical fitness test, or require practitioner intervention.The needed solution is a scalable and convenient user interface that is functional with or without wearable technologies, collects data across all five domains, provides individualized performance plans, and is capable of interfacing with the Army's data fabric, allowing for the creation of leader dashboards across multiple unit configurations. This will allow data-informed interventions to occur sooner, improve performance and readiness across the unit, allow for a more persistent repository of Soldier data, and provide leaders who have different roles and requirements (command structure, different H2F practitioners, and others) with the tools to understand the individual and collective readiness of Soldiers across the formation.In this solicitation we are focused on creating the user interface that Soldiers can interact with on a daily basis. This tool will allow them to easily and quickly record their data, receive coaching, and interface with the Army's data fabric. Key capabilities of this system could include but are not limited to:Solution should have three types of interfaces designed for ease of use:Soldier Interface: profile for individual, data entry locations, and statistics for the individual user, instructional tools and videos for reference, and an ability to auto refer soldier to practitioner.Tiered Supervisor Interface: leaders have access to summary information of subordinate data (ex. red-amber-green on status) for tracking and immediate intervention to improve readiness; generalized and aggregated data (i.e. dashboards) for ease of access and to alert the leaders of potential problems; suggestions to supervisor for recommended interventionH2F Performance Team Provider interface: Soldier performance summaries, alerts to Soldiers that indicate negative/positive trend thresholds, individual Soldier data to refer to appropriate care provider(s). Ability to display charts/graphs for individual and larger population sets. bility to send intervention protocols (inclusive of surveys, direct messaging, and appointment scheduling) .Easy to use solution that can be downloaded on a mobile device with web-based capability for access on a computer. Should be compatible with iOS and Android operating systems. Functionality for automatic emails and notifications based on defined data triggers. Ability to track soldiers throughout their career. Aggregate data anonymized for leader analysis at higher levels.Ability to record performance for all five H2F domains using a combination of either manual input, customizable questionnaires, or wearable sensors for existing commercial systems common in the AMS space (ex. Whoop, Polar, Garmin, Oura, Fitbit, Apple, etc.).Ability to deliver coaching for all five H2F domains, along with automatic recommendations to individual users based on thresholds established by practitioners. Need ease of access to the data for further manual analysis across all inputs from practitioners. Ability to download the data into a usable data set in ubiquitous spreadsheet format (xls, csv, etc.)Tool must be modifiable to allow for different questions/measurements within sub organizations across the Army that aggregate to an overall database for performance metrics.An onboarding and training program that allows for either the unit or the performer, to establish accounts and structure of the test population rapidly, with a goal of within 1 week.",913,6207,1,No,No,No,,"Design proof of concept solution for digital interface tool that allows data collection and programming for all five H2F domains (fitness, sleep, nutrition, spiritual, and mental readiness) and that has an API solution for Army Vantage or other government accredited cloud platforms.

This could be accomplished through the proper demonstration of any viable athlete management system that meets the listed capabilities.Soldier touchpoint will be provided free of charge.PHASE II:Demonstrate a prototype user interface that is capable at a minimum of accepting inputs (manual), delivering individualized coaching and tracking performance data in at least one domain. Solution will be provided to three Soldier test groups that will evaluate and provide feedback on the device under realistic use conditions for 60 days. Units will include an Infantry Brigade Combat Team (4100 Soldiers), Armored Brigade Combat Team (4700 Soldiers), and one other brigade size element (4000 Soldiers) with embedded Army teams trained as providers and coaches across all given domains. Potential solutions will be evaluated on the usability of the interface, the number of domains included, ease of data input, ease of programming and analytic display at the coach level, ability to customize performance plans for each Soldier during the 90-day experiment. Access to Soldiers during the touchpoints for feedback is free of charge, and companies should include the estimated cost of travel (assume three, multi day trips, to each of three locations for set-up, midterm feedback, and final feedback) to these touchpoints in their budget. Companies should also include a two-day trip for an in-person outbrief. In addition virtual touch points with other relevant Army stakeholders will occur throughout the period of performance.During the experiment Soldiers will establish a baseline in the relevant domains at the start of app usage, and assess their performance at the end to evaluate the impact the interface had on improvement in that domain. Soldiers will also provide feedback at two-week intervals on the evaluation factors mentioned above, allowing the solicitation respondent to identify areas requiring additional development to adapt the prototype to Army use cases.In addition to the Phase II deliverable of a prototype for extended Soldier touch points, companies will provide monthly and final reports detailing performance analysis of the interface as well as modifications required based on the Soldier feedback received. The final report should also include plans to scale across the remaining domains (if needed) and how the interface will interact with the Army's data fabric.","The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives through the effort. Companies will scale interface across additional domains (as needed), make modifications in interface as identified through extended Soldier touch points and create API allowing the interface to interact with the Army's data fabric or structure as determined.Phase III deliverables include a demonstrable prototype involving all five domains that interface with the Army's data fabric allowing for creation of higher-level dashboards. Prototype should allow data from all 5 domains to be analyzed in relation to each other including basic and advanced statistical associations, regression and mediation analysis, and facilitate identification of and predictors of performance.

To this end, the topic requests novel materials for use as both a rocket propellant and a high explosive. The materials should enable development of a dual-use munition offering both an enhanced detonation mode and an extended-range/penetration mode. Such a munition would offer selectable effects through the use of an ignition element for the extended-range mode and a detonator for the high explosive mode. This development is expected to drive advancements in ignition and munition train technology, necessitating smart sensors to determine when the propellant should be detonated during flight.",140,931,1,No,No,No,,"Offeror should produce samples of at least four different formulations under consideration and perform small-scale testing to indicate the materials are safe to handle in suitable quantities. Thermal characterization must be conducted to determine if the material will have the stability requisite for the intended application. This process will also provide data such as enthalpy of combustion, detonation speed, and decomposition temperature. Thermochemical code calculations should be performed to produce initial estimates of the performance of these materials. Small-scale combustion and detonation tests are to be conducted to assess the relative performance of the developmental materials under consideration.","Offeror should produce two or three formulations (downselected based on input from Armaments Center) to perform larger scale testing. This process should incorporate tests such as cylinder expansion, detonation velocity and pressure, characterization of mechanical properties, critical diameter, gap sensitivity, strand burner tests (at various pressures), 2x4 inch thrust tests, and aging studies. This data should be evaluated to identify the best candidates for the intended application.","Phase III will focus on a live-fire demonstration of the developmental formulation in a complete munition. This process will showcase a munition that demonstrates efficient use of the energetic payload in both modes. Other relevant testing such as IM testing, arena testing, set back testing, penetration depth, etc. willalso be conducted as necessary depending on the needs of the item manager.",1,"The chemistry of explosives, Jacqueline Akhavan;; Introduction to the technology of explosives, Paul Cooper;; Explosive Effects and Applications, Jonas Zukas, William Walters","The chemistry of explosives, Jacqueline Akhavan;; Introduction to the technology of explosives, Paul Cooper;; Explosive Effects and Applications, Jonas Zukas, William Walters",5,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/84040/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/84040/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,DoD STTR 2021.C Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:17:53,,,,,A21C-T001_84040,DOD_STTR_2021_P1_CC_A21C-T001,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:32.635591+00

To enhance the energetic performance and printability of these formulations, new energetic ingredients for AM resin systems are desired. Specifically, these include energetic monomers, crosslinkers, and plasticizers. Although additive manufacturing techniques are largely recent developments, energetic polymers and plasticizers have a relatively long history. Their purpose has generally been as components in chemically cured energetic formulations such as explosive ""cast-cure"" or polymer-bonded explosives (PBX), where energetic monomers and plasticizers are blended with high-solids loadings of explosive materials (e.g. RDX) and chemically cured into a desired shape/configuration.

Increasing the performance of these engines requires operation at higher fuel pressures, which creates a challenge related to fuel lubricity. Sufficient fuel lubricity in the engine fuel systems is a necessity for effective operation. At higher pressures that need is more acute, as insufficient lubricity could lead to catastrophic failure due to wear or damage.Most of these vehicles use F-24 jet fuel. There are many different blends of F-24 due to variations in the base fluid and contaminants present. This makes it very difficult to employ in higher-pressure common rail engines, as they may not have sufficient lubricity under all the potential F-24 formulations available. It may not be possible to obtain the ideal formulation of F-24 in the field, and the use of an unsuitable formulation may impair or damage the engine. For higher-pressure fuel systems to be practical in a logistical sense, a solution that enables consistent lubricity for these engines under a variety of conditions and formulations is required. The most practical solution would be a coating that provided protection and sufficient lubricity to the engine parts during operation by formation of renewable protective coatings. A recently proposed solution is the use of coatings that form self-lubricating carbon-based diamond like coatings due to catalytic breakdown of hydrocarbons and contaminants in the fuel [1,2]. This previously was very difficult as these catalysis reactions are facilitated by the use of precious metals such as platinum and gold [3]. In addition, the coating also had to be nanostructured to obtain the desired level of interaction with the organic compounds in the fuel. Recent publications, however, have established it is possible to create nanocrystalline coatings using physical vapor deposition and sputtering techniques [4]. In addition, advances in the field of nanocrystalline alloy design have led to the discovery of a number of potential nanocrystalline alloy compositions that are suitable to fabrication via sputtering or other surface coating techniques [5]. This opens up the possibility of creating a stable nanocrystalline coating using more cost effective alloying elements. In fact, there have been recent publications demonstrating protective tribofilm formation using coatings containing Co, Mo, Cr, Al, and other alloying elements [1, 6]. This makes it plausible that a practical nanocrystalline alloy that forms protective tribofilms during engine operation could be developed for wide scale employment in the field. While some coatings have been demonstrated in the laboratory, there is still a great deal of development required before they can be utilized in an engine fuel system. Any coating used for this application must be stable under a variety of conditions and robust under mechanical stresses. The tribofilm formed must be protective, otherwise the coating would prematurely wear and cause the engine to fail. In addition, the processing challenges related to industrial scale application of the coating and consistent application to complex geometries have to be addressed.",493,3247,1,No,No,No,,"The offeror(s) shall develop a coating for AISI 52100 steel that will form protective tribofilms in alkane based fuels. A composition shall be selected that will form a stable nanocrystalline structure, not utilize precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and gold, and be mechanically stabile under load. The mechanism used to create the tribofilm can be based on any type of or combination of mechanisms (e.g. compositional, morphological, mechanical, etc.). However, the tribofilm created should provide protection for the coating and the steel and renew through continuing interactions with the fuel. The coating itself should not require reapplication for long-term function. The final deliverable shall be at least one candidate coating composition, lubricity testing results, and evidence of tribofilm formation. The coating shall be applied to a ball of AISI 52100, and tested for lubricity under following conditions: 1) in comparison to the standard hardened AISI 52100 ball, 2) with at least two fuels selected from diesel, Jet-A, and F-24, 3) using fuel lubricity standard ASTM D6079 (High-Frequency Reciprocating Rig), and 4) using fuel lubricity standard ASTM D5001 (Ball-On-Cylinder Lubricity Evaluator). F-24 can be obtained from the Army sponsor.","The offeror(s) shall continue to refine the coating composition, and begin to develop the processing approach for uniform application of the coatings to conformal and complex parts. The compositions identified in Phase I should be adjusted to be suitable for wide scale industrial fabrication. The offeror(s) should select a processing approach, and develop methodologies for uniform application of the coating on conformal AISI 52100 steel parts relevant to high-pressure fuel pumps. The final deliverables shall be four components (pumping piston, piston bore, small crowned cylinder, large cylinder) of a pump rated to reach 1500 bar or greater, with the coating uniformly applied to all contacting surfaces and tested for lubricity in two mechanical interfaces.

The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in data-driven design of next-generation protection materials. However, ballistic evaluation of protection materials presents a significant bottleneck: due to safety concerns and stringent testing requirements (e.g., the V50 ballistic test for armor as described by DoD MIL-STD-662F), full-scale ballistic tests are expensive and generate data at a very low rate, on the order of 10 samples/day. Sub-scale ballistic testing (e.g., laser-driven micro-projectiles, air gun-driven microbeads, electric-discharge-driven flyer plates) offers a potential route around these limitations, with the ability to use dramatically smaller projectiles and smaller samples to improve safety, expense, and significantly increase throughput. Nonetheless, sub-scale ballistic data collection is still relatively slow-alignment and calibration are exhaustively hands-on processes that could benefit from automation-and analysis is still done manually and post mortem. For example, fragmentation analysis, a valuable proxy for impact performance of brittle protection materials, is still done by manually collecting and analyzing each fragment that results from the subscale ballistic impact. Importantly, the accuracy of sub-scale methods against full-scale ballistic tests must be further evaluated: equivalent testing standards do not yet exist, and sub-scale techniques are only valuable so far as they provide accurate information about the real-world ballistic performance of a protection material. This situation warrants a concerted effort to enable high-throughput sub-scale ballistic testing and carefully evaluate its fidelity. The goal for this effort is to develop a sub-scale ballistic testing platform as a critical tool for data-driven, high-throughput design and characterization of next-generation protection materials.",275,2061,1,No,No,No,,"Define and develop an approach for high-throughput sub-scale ballistic testing of macroscale protection materials. The specific sub-scale method is not prescribed, but must be capable of creating ballistic, high loading rate (i.e. between 104 and 107 s-1) mechanical testing conditions that serve as an accurate proxy for a full-scale ballistic test. Specific capabilities that are desired include: in situ quantitative characterization and analysis capabilities that provide as good or better determination of ballistic performance as traditional post mortem manual analysis or conventional failure probability analyses, like V50. The approach should also be capable of automation (e.g., in sample preparation/loading, alignment, data processing, etc.) to maximize testing and data throughput: the concept must demonstrate a 10-fold improvement in the rate of experimentation over manual subscale ballistic testing, and a 100-fold improvement over full scale ballistic testing conventionally used to satisfy V50/MIL-STD-662F. Note that the approach is not intended to replace ballistic testing standards, but rather shall complement existing standards by enabling rapid screening of materials. The method should be tailored for research and development of next-generation hard protection materials based on ceramics, composites, and/or metals (as opposed to soft materials like polymers, or low-dimensional materials like graphene), and must serve as an accurate surrogate for full-scale ballistic testing while simultaneously enabling safe, high-throughput data generation and collection for data-driven design of advanced protection materials. The concept must also outline an approach for qualifying the accuracy of the method with respect to predicting material performance under full scale ballistic testing based on MIL-STD-662F. If awarded the Phase I option, the small business will demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept/approach. Develop a Phase II plan.","Based on Phase I results, develop, demonstrate, and validate the proposed high-throughput test apparatus for sub-scale ballistic testing. The accuracy of the automated in situ approach will be quantified relative to a manual post mortem approach to data analysis, using the same sub-scale ballistic technique. The test must demonstrate a 10-fold improvement in the rate of experimentation with respect to manual subscale ballistic testing, and a 100-fold improvement over full scale ballistic testing to satisfy V50/MIL-STD-662F. The technique should encompass one or more of the following projectile geometries: highly planar flyer plates, spheres, and/or projectiles with ogived noses. The technique should enable various angles of target obliquity with respect to the vector of projectile velocity. High throughput data generation should be leveraged to facilitate data-driven inferences about the behavior and design of protection materials. The fidelity of the sub-scale technique and these inferences will be evaluated with select full-scale ballistic tests for V50/MIL-STD-662F. It is recommended that the performer work with government laboratories and/or established testing agencies to perform these select ballistic tests. It is also recommended that the performer work with bulk material vendors/Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and/or ballistic testing agencies to facilitate transition for Phase III. Successful completion of Phase II shall include a demonstration to DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory scientists and engineers engaged in ballistic testing of protection materials.","The completion of this effort would provide an automated tool that receives, prepares, assesses, and analyzes the ballistic performance of subscale samples in a way that accurately reflects the global behavior of the bulk material. Phase III will transition high throughput sub-scale ballistic testing techniques to commercial suppliers through bulk material vendors, OEMs, or other partnering agreement(s). Commercialization of this technology may be through the development of kits or modules for retrofitting existing subscale ballistic testing apparatus, or through the development of full turn-key systems.

Advanced imaging sensors-like electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) cameras and micro-bolometers-will dramatically proliferate as DoD continues to modernize with autonomous platforms such as the Army's Next Generation Combat Vehicle. However, these sensors are vulnerable to inadvertent and adversarial electromagnetic (EM) attack: future operating environments will be replete with a wide range of EM waves of varied frequency and intensity, many of which could temporarily or permanently blind or damage imaging systems. The ability to control strong light-matter interaction in liquid crystals[1], metamaterials [2-5], epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials [6,7], phase change materials (PCMs) [8,9], micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) [10],and soft materials [11-14] suggest that these state-of-the-art materials systems can be leveraged to create tunable filters that autonomously respond to EM attack. For example, spatial light modulation (SLM) by metamaterials, holography, and liquid crystals enables selective-area light attenuation [1,2]. Digital metamaterials offer lenses and phase modulators capable of light redirection and beam steering [3,4]. Non-linear optical responses in Bragg reflector stacks and ENZ materials provide another potential route to autonomous light attenuation [5-7]. Integrating these concepts with PCMs, MEMS, and micro-mirrors may reveal new opportunities and platforms for programmable SLM and beam steering [8-10]. Finally, soft materials like liquid crystal elastomers and photo-responsive hydrogels have recently emerged as new platforms for autonomous manipulation of light [11-14], offering new abilities to create nano/microstructures that move in response to light and platforms for trapping and guiding laser beams. New capabilities in nano-/microfabrication may enable new, hierarchical approaches that combine multiple stimuli-responsive materials and architectures to further enhance adaptability.If under EM attack, an imaging system must incorporate a filter that rapidly senses an EM wave, determines its wavelength, and autonomously responds to attenuate or re-direct the wave if necessary. This capability is necessary over broad spectral ranges, including ultraviolet, visible, short-wave infrared (SWIR), and long-wave infrared (LWIR). An ideal intelligent filter mechanism would be (1) Operable in typical battlefield conditions; (2) Compatible with dynamically reconfigurable and/or multi-spectral imaging systems; (3) Low-cost, to enable wide adaptation across the DoD; (4) Adaptable to different imaging architectures; and (5) Non-disruptive to imaging performance (e.g., range, resolution, frame-rate, etc.). This topic seeks innovative materials approaches to creating such filters, based on passive material-based intrinsic responses and/or active feedback circuits incorporating tunable materials. Adaptive filters should autonomously detect changes in operating conditions and/or EM-based insults (e.g., a change in lighting conditions vs. incident laser beams) and respond appropriately by physically dimming, shuttering, switching, filtering, blocking, and/or rejecting the dynamic light conditions. The response should further be localized to the incident beam or spot where appropriate, to maintain an unobstructed field-of-view for the rest of the imaging system. Finally, there is also a significant need for scaled-up manufacturing capacity and yield-the desired adaptive filters should be amenable to integration with imaging sensors with minimum added size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C).",492,3782,1,No,No,No,,"Design a concept for candidate FAST filters and describe the proposed materials systems, architectures, and control schemes that will be employed. Perform ab initio atomistic modeling, full wave EM simulations, quasi-static simulations, finite element analysis, and/or technology computer-aided design (TCAD) as needed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. Outline the techniques and procedures that will be used to fabricate the proposed design and characterize its dynamic filtering performance. Develop an approach to integrate the proposed FAST filter with a desired sensor technology, imaging platform, or form factor, selected from the following: focal-plane array (flat or curved), optical windows and lenses, glasses, contact lenses, goggles, or visors. As appropriate, create a partial prototype that demonstrates the functionality of one or more of the proposed design elements: the dynamic materials system, the filter architecture, the control scheme (if applicable), and/or the integration scheme.FAST filter designs should inherently address or be easily adaptable to operate in the visible (380 - 780 nm) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR, 780 - 3000 nm) portions of the EM spectrum. Ultraviolet (UV, 100 - 380 nm) and mid-/long-wave infrared (MWIR/LWIR, 3000 - 14000 nm) light are also of (secondary) interest. The filtering mechanism should be dormant under normal imaging conditions, with optical transmission of 70 - 80% or greater at the nominal imaging wavelengths. The filter should autonomously respond to respond to high-fluence light (e.g., a high-power laser with a fluence on the order of 1 J/cm2) above the damage threshold of the imaging system should be interdicted by the filter changing its optical density (OD) by 3 or more (i.e., less than 0.1% of the incident laser energy should reach the sensor). The filter responses should be as localized to the incident spot size, in order to allow uninterrupted imaging while obscuring the sensing element(s) beneath the incident spot. These filter responses should be fully reversible, and the response time, including recovery to normal imaging conditions, should be no longer than 50 milliseconds. Articulate feasible pathways to response times of 1 nanosecond or less. Secondary considerations for FAST filter design include: 1) Low fluence light (e.g., changes in lighting conditions caused by shadows or moving between indoors and outdoors) should cause the filter to remain passive so that the imaging system can automatically adjust to lighting conditions; 2) Medium fluence light (e.g., an adversarial laser-based sensor or probe) should be fully absorbed, redirected, or otherwise mitigated to cloak the imaging system.","Based on Phase I modeling and proofs of concept, fabricate, test, and demonstrate at least one operational FAST filter prototype. The prototype should be capable of autonomous optical responses with sub-ns response times. The FAST filters should reversibly cycle over 105 times without suffering more than 2% degradation in response time, OD change, reflection, transmission, dormant state/position, etc. Using a detailed analysis of system trades and input from appropriate stakeholders, propose a pathway to refine and integrate the FAST filter prototype with a candidate imaging system of interest to or used by the Army. Depending on the target imaging system, the FAST filters should increase the total SWaP-C burden by 0.1% or less, should not adversely impact imaging performance, and should allow normal imaging modality over typical ranges of brightness/lighting conditions; more specifically, FAST filters under normal imaging conditions should not change the system's modulation transfer function by more than 10%, and should not change transmission of imaging wavelengths by more than 20%.","Phase II should demonstrate a FAST filter that is appropriate for implementation with existing and/or future Army imaging systems. Phase III will transition the newly developed FAST filter technology to commercial availability through the prime contractors that build these imaging systems, the original equipment manufacturers that manufacture sensing components, other relevant suppliers, and/or other partnering agreement(s), as appropriate. Commercialization of this technology may occur via the incorporation of one or more FAST filters anywhere in an imaging system (e.g., windows, lenses, shutters, FPA pixels, etc.).Ideally, a successful effort will deliver a capability upgrade for a relevant Army Program of Record at the end of Phase III, in the form of an imaging system that autonomously responds to EM attack with no added cognitive burden to the user, and a minimum added SWaP-C burden. Expected dual-use applications include autonomous vehicles, LiDAR, border security, and protecting civilian optical imaging systems (e.g., thermal imaging of the sun).",1,"Forbes, A., Dudley, A., & McLaren, M.

The reasons for the success of EDFAs are low noise figure, large gain bandwidth, high saturation power, and low polarization dependence. The EDFA is typically pumped by either a 980 nm or a 1480 nm semiconductor laser diode, which already contains an optical amplifier, namely, the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). For the last two decades, the photonics industry has tried, in vain, to displace EDFAs by SOAs to reduce the cost as well as SWaP (size, weight and power). One of the main drawbacks of the SOA, in comparison with the EDFA, is its noise figure. Commercial SOA initially had noise figures above 6 dB due to coupling losses from the SOA waveguide to the optical fibers [2]. Recent efforts in reducing the coupling loss has results in SOA noise figures approaching 5 dB [3]. However, EDFAs can routinely maintain noise figures around 4 dB. The disadvantage in noise figure for SOAs is due to the fundamental noise processes of the semiconductor gain medium, and therefore, requires novel solutions to overcome. Another issue with SOAs is the low saturation power. Compared to the EDFA, the active region of the SOA has a cross-sectional area on the order of micron squared whereas the active region of the EDFA has a cross-sectional area on the order of 100 micron squared. To date, commercial SOAs can offer saturation power around 15 dBm, much lower than EDFAs [4]. The third disadvantage of the SOA is its polarization-dependent gain since, naturally, the quantum-well active region favors the transverse-electric mode in the amplification processes [5]. These three disadvantages, however, have not stopped the photonic industry's pursuits of eventually replacing EDFAs by SOAs. One such recent example is the use of broadband SOAs for digital coherent optical communication, in which one broadband SOA can replace three EDFAs in the S, C, and L band, respectively [6]. Nevertheless, the fundamental disadvantages of the SOA clearly hindered such efforts. For example, the polarization-dependent gain was reduced by using the complicated polarization-diversity configuration, which significantly increase the complexity of the device [6]. The relatively high noise figure also prevented the SOAs from being used for long-haul transmission. If the drawbacks in noise figure, saturation power and polarization sensitivity can be overcome, SOAs can have a tremendous impact on defense and commercial applications. Low-noise, high-power SOAs are extremely desirable in photonic integrated circuits such as RF photonic phased arrays for radars, microwave photonic filters and processors for electronic warfare, as well as high-power direct laser diodes. The purpose of the STTR program is to support the development of novel SOAs that can replace EDFAs at least in certain applications scenarios.",468,3025,1,No,No,No,,"To design, fabricate and characterize an SOA with optical gain of up to 20 dB or more with noise figure below 5 dB, saturation power above 20 dBm in the C band. In addition, provide a design that will further reduce the noise figure to below 4.5 dB and polarization-dependent gain to below 2 dB, and increase saturation power to above 27 dBm in the C+L band.

In addition, provide a design that will further reduce the noise figure to below 4.0 dB, and increase saturation power to above 30 dBm in the S+C+L band, with low polarization-dependent gain.

These systems could provide US adversaries with a low-cost means of conducting intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions against or even attacking US forces. Many small UASs cannot be detected by traditional air defense systems due to their size, construction material, and flight altitude.Conventional microwave systems for detecting small airborne threats, such as counter rocket and mortar (C-RAM) radars, rely on high target speed to reject clutter but face challenges for low, slow, small UASs. The greater Doppler sensitivity and narrower radar beamwidths can be achieved at millimeter-wave (MMW) (30-300 GHz) frequencies could potentially enable detection and resolution of slower objects in more complex terrain. Larger radar bandwidths allow high range resolution, which can facilitate the classification and tracking of slow moving objects. MMW offers additional advantages over optical and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. MMW has good penetration characteristics in the presence of fog, smoke or dust. Radars are active sensors that operate independently of external lighting and the time of day, allowing day/night/all-weather operation. On the system side, recent advances in low cost RF-CMOS technology have significantly lowered the cost of MMW systems, and enabled the commercialization of these systems such as automotive radars. Building on low power RF-CMOS technology, low cost single-chip collision avoidance radars at 77 GHz have become widely available. Besides offering high range resolution, they also include multiple transmitters and receivers in a single-chip form factor that can be electronically configured into coherent beam forming mode for MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) radar mode with enhanced angular resolution. MMW radars operating in MIMO mode are particularly attractive for tracking UASs.A reliable UAS radar system must be able to discriminate quadcopters, fixed-wing drones, from birds and slow-moving ground objects. Micro-Doppler is generated due to the organic motion of the various components within a target, such as propeller blade rotation for a drone or wing flapping for a bird. Because these motions result in distinct time-Doppler-frequency patterns, micro-Doppler is more useful than RCS or bulk speed for unique identification of small UAS targets. Higher frequencies at MMW band could be advantageous by providing better Doppler resolution from ground clutter in a shorter time, therefore reducing the minimum detectable target velocity. When combined with artificial neural networks or other machine learning algorithms, these micro-Doppler features can be used to train a radar to detect and classify an UAS.Despite the potential advantages of MMW radar for counter UAS detection, many challenges exist in hardware and software. Hardware at MMW frequencies remains expensive and low efficiency, resulting bulky systems with high power consumption. Fully utilization of micro-Doppler features will require development in low phase-noise sources as well as classification algorithms that can operate with limited training data. The goal of this STTR topic is overcoming these challenges to achieve systems with both high spatial resolution and classification performance using micro-Doppler extracted from MMW MIMO radar returns.",497,3453,1,No,No,No,,"Establish a MMW MIMO radar simulation testbed for detection, classification and tracking of small UASs.

The requirement is for a technology that is readily available in far-forward situations and effective against the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). Of these, Acinetobacter baumannii has been reported among veterans and soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and has been referred to as ""Iraqibacter."" [1] These organisms are the leading cause of nosocomial infections throughout the world. The proposed solution should be safe for users and ideally minimize the potential for organisms to develop resistance. This system could be applied as a bandage or a skin/wound surface treatment to minimize the probability of bacterial infections. Beyond the urgent military need, there is a significant public health requirement for improved antimicrobial wound treatments: there are currently 6.5 million people in the U.S. with chronic wounds or wounds that are slow to heal, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health [2].A particularly promising route to a novel antibacterial effective against MDR pathogens is antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), also referred to as photodynamic inactivation (PDI). In this process a dye is activated by a light source and interacts with oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) with an antimicrobial effect [3, 4, 5, 6]. While many antimicrobial technologies have been investigated, the photodynamic approach has the unique advantage of applying a separate energy source to aid the antimicrobial activity. The ROS are effective against a broad spectrum of species, and this mode of action helps to prevent pathogens from developing resistance. The proposer should identify an effective, portable light source and show how it could be used in far-forward situations. The light-activated approach is potentially limited due to the absorption of light by tissue, and the selected wavelength of light can greatly affect depth of penetration; any response should also address the efficacy against deep wounds",333,2267,1,No,No,No,,"In Phase I the contractor should develop the selected photodynamic system and show through in vitro tests that it is effective against MDR pathogens under the expected conditions. Tests should compare its performance to currently used antibacterial agents and demonstrate a significant and potentially clinically valuable improvement in performance. The target system should demonstrate antibacterial performance against one or more of the target organisms that is at least as good as the current alternatives. A desirable feature of a novel antibacterial system is a mode of action that will slow development of resistance in pathogenic organisms. The performer should identify methods to apply this treatment in both military hospitals and far-forward situations, and estimate the size, weight and cost of the new system. *RESEARCH INVOLVING ANIMAL OR HUMAN SUBJECTS: The SBIR/STTR Programs discourage offerors from proposing to conduct Human or Animal Subject Research during Phase 1 due to the significant lead time required to prepare the documentation and obtain approval, which will delay the Phase 1 award.All research involving human subjects (to include use of human biological specimens and human data) and animals, shall comply with the applicable federal and state laws and agency policy/guidelines for human subject and animal protection. Research involving the use of human subjects may not begin until the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command's Office of Research Protections, Human Research Protections Office (HRPO) approves the protocol. Written approval to begin research or subcontract for the use of human subjects under the applicable protocol proposed for an award will be issued from the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, HRPO, under separate letter to the Contractor. Non-compliance with any provision may result in withholding of funds and or the termination of the award.","In Phase II the performer will optimize the new photodynamic system. The breakthrough advantage should be clearly identified. For example, is the new system effective against a particular pathogen or category of pathogens? What is the best method of application? What improvement does the new technology provide over existing systems? Does the new technology provide evidence of user safety? In vitro tests will guide development to a photodynamic formulation and bandage pad composition that is effective against multidrug resistant pathogens of concern. During Phase II the performer should define the final product that will be the focus of further testing and FDA clearance, for example by a 510(k) submission demonstrating safety and efficacy. If the performer chooses to test with animal models, all tests must be in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and Animal Care and Use Review Office (ACURO) guidelines. The final product configuration will be thoroughly evaluated, providing data relevant to both efficacy and ease of use in logistically changing environments. At the conclusion of Phase II the performer will have clearly defined a path to FDA clearance.","Phase III work is typically oriented towards technology transition to Acquisition Programs of Record and/or commercialization of SBIR research or technology. In Phase III, the performer is expected to seek funding from non-SBIR government sources and/or the private sector to develop or transition the prototype into a viable product or service for sale in the military or private sector markets. The Phase III description must include the ""vision"" or ""end-state"" of the research. It must describe one or more specific Phase III military applications and/or supported S&T or acquisition program as well as the most likely path for transition of the SBIR from research to operational capability.

A: Per the topic, radar-based solutions are highly-desired and preferred. With that said, alternative approaches capable of addressing the topic goals and metrics will also be considered.

2)&nbsp; We understand the complexities of determining concrete strength with Radar, is the strength aspect a necessary part of an acceptable proposal?&nbsp; If so where does it rank in terms of priority among the other parameters being asked for?
A: <ol>
	<li>Can you provide any parameters of the existing systems being used or generally characterize them in terms of SWAP?</li>
</ol>

Our desire is for a system that is small, portable, and low power to maximize field deployability. With that said, we have not specified these constraints as we first would like a system that works (in terms of accurately predicting strength, thickness, and rebar), but do keep in mind that SWaP is key consideration here.

<ol start=""2"">
	<li>We understand the complexities of determining concrete strength with Radar, is the strength aspect a necessary part of an acceptable proposal?&nbsp; If so where does it rank in terms of priority among the other parameters being asked for?</li>
</ol>

Strength is a critical factor. In terms of specific system metrics, the technology MUST be able to measure:

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:12px"">thickness UP TO 6 FT, with an accuracy of +/- 1ft</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:12px"">Compressive strength within the range of 3000 to 30000 psi, and with an accuracy of +/- 3000psi</li>
</ul>

Additionally, the system must be able to detect both fiber and metal reinforcements. Metal reinforcements should be detected/located to +/- 1ft.",,Electronics,1,Electronics,General Warfighting Requirements (GWR),General Warfighting Requirements (GWR),1,"Ground Penetrating Radar, Concrete Characterization, IED Detection, Mine Detection",1,"Ground Penetrating Radar, Concrete Characterization, IED Detection, Mine Detection",No,0,No,,"Develop a small, portable, low power field device that can estimate the strength and thickness, to 6 feet, of reinforced concrete structures and identify and locate metal contained therein.",29,"Develop a small, portable, low power field device that can estimate the strength and thickness, to 6 feet, of reinforced concrete structures and identify and locate metal contained therein.","Reinforced concrete structures impede the movement of military personnel in a variety of military missions. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of the structural characteristics (e.g., material strength, level of reinforcement, thickness) of these structures is important for calculating the amount of charge that must be placed to breach the structure. NDE remains an application requirement in order for missions to remain stealthy. Several techniques have been considered for NDE of reinforced concrete in order to test for defects and deterioration. Techniques such as ultrasound require a transmitter probe that presents short duration high voltage pulses into piezoelectric crystals, and their expansion produces a pressure pulse that administers a broadband field into the concrete. Such systems can be large, require significant power, and are expensive, rendering them impracticable for tactical applications. Conversely, ground penetrating radar is another NDE technique that has also been used extensively to interrogate concrete that may overcome these deficiencies. Currently there are no methods when combined and simple to use to close this need for breaching.While concrete can withstand significant compressive stresses, its tensile strength is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than the compressive strength. Historically, this issue has been addressed by reinforcing concrete with reinforcing bars, rebar, and/or fibers to improve tensile strength. Recent advances in manufacturing high strength concrete mixes, such as those by Lafarge, have rendered current approaches to assessing strength and thickness of concrete (and thus charge size) less accurate. A simple, low power, small and accurate alternative utilizing ground penetrating radar (GPR) technology is sought. GPR has commonly been used for interrogating the ground in a nondestructive fashion in order to assess the presence of objects of interest (landmines, pipes, IEDs) buried below the surface. There are several geophysical companies who utilize GPR for a variety of interrogation applications, including locating rebar in concrete to aid excavation, location of utilities and pipes, forensics and graveyard surveying, etc. The proposed concept for structural assessment of reinforced concrete must operate in a variety of conditions with high accuracy and rapid analysis time. Systems that leverage currently fielded Army systems are preferred, and a detailed proof of concept plan is critical",355,2488,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the hardware and software design that supports the interrogation technology needed to estimate relevant structural parameters such as reinforced concrete thickness-up to six feet, concrete strength over a range of 3,000 to 30,000 psi, density of reinforcement, and presence of fiber reinforcement. In addition, the approach should be able to locate metal substructure. The approach should demonstrate the ability to estimate these parameters in controlled proof-of-concept experiments with an accuracy of one foot in thickness and +/- 3,000 psi in strength over a variety of structures. In addition, the impact of reinforcement additives such as composite or metallic fiber should be assessed and design issues to address any confounding issues should be put forth. Power consumption and estimated system weight must also be addressed and should be within a factor of two of similar Army deployed equipment. The existence of metal objects should be detected and located to =/- one foot on the wall surface and the density of reinforcement and fiber-reinforcement estimated.","Develop and field test the proposed system for estimating relevant structural parameters and metal substructure. Optimize the design and algorithms for performance, weight, and power consumption. Develop and engineer hardware and software to meet program goals.

We are confused about your references to FM CW RADAR. We are very familiar with TDR cable testers, but they don&#39;t sound much like what you are asking for.

Are you trying to detect nonlinear faults? If you want a nonlinear system that can detect weak connections, you need a different architecture.

&nbsp;

2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the detector connected to the cable?

ANSWER: Yes

&nbsp;

3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are confused about your references to FM CW RADAR. We are very familiar with TDR cable testers, but they don&#39;t sound much like what you are asking for. Are you trying to detect nonlinear faults?

ANSWER:&nbsp; We are looking into FMCW as a technical approach or some novel derivative to provide a simple, hand-handle, low power device for the technician forward in the field that can fault isolate a wire issue (shorts, open, corrosion, potential intermittent faults, partial broken wire, insolation anomalies, &nbsp;From the simplistic fault to the more complex, to detect, localize, characterize and potentially prognostise the fault or expected remaining useful life (RUL).&nbsp; The TDR has some good qualities and is well known and developed.&nbsp; TDR does have some limitations.

&nbsp;

If you want a nonlinear system that can detect weak connections, you need a different architecture.

&nbsp;

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you looking for new hardware or new machine learning algorithms for fault protection?

ANSWER: The hardware currently being used for in-house exploration of FMCW is bench level hardware, as well as supporting software (OS, ML, AI), and not meant as engineered prototype HR/SR.&nbsp; These will be available to the winning proposal as a learning point to move forward with their effort.

	<li>Are the FMCW radar parameters (e.g., center/carrier frequency, bandwidth, blind range/distance, the maximum working range/distance, receiver bandwidth and sampling rate, chirp width, duration, number of chirps per scan, etc.) determined? If they are determined, will you share these parameters in the Phase I work?</li>
	<li>Is the radar receiver&rsquo;s analog filter cutoff frequency controllable, or the radar receiver analog filter&rsquo;s cutoff frequency is fixed? &nbsp;</li>

	<br />
	Answer:&nbsp;You are correct, we are looking for a novel RADAR (FMCW) implementation to detect, localize, characterize and prognostise wire faults.&nbsp; The proposer may utilize lessons learned from in-house efforts.&nbsp; In-house efforts have developed hardware/software for bench top testing and should not be considered as a product item at this time.&nbsp; The proposer will design their own hardware/software.&nbsp; The proposer is free to optimize and make a case for their approach regarding FMCW parameters; bandwidth, chirp, duration, power, etc to meet the expected goals of the STTR.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Are the FMCW radar parameters (e.g., center/carrier frequency, bandwidth, blind range/distance, the maximum working range/distance, receiver bandwidth and sampling rate, chirp width, duration, number of chirps per scan, etc.) determined? If they are determined, will you share these parameters in the Phase I work?<br />
	<br />
	Answer:&nbsp;These parameters are up to the proposer to optimize to achieve the end goals of the STTR and provide a hand held, low power cable analyzer.&nbsp; The in-house effort has focused on attempting to characterize from the connector to no more than 10 meters of cable length various wire types.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Is the radar receiver&rsquo;s analog filter cutoff frequency controllable, or the radar receiver analog filter&rsquo;s cutoff frequency is fixed? &nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Answer:&nbsp;This is up to the proposer to make a determination and make their case.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The solicitation focuses on corrosion. Usually corrosion takes place after installation broken. Is this effort also interested in insulation degradation?<br />
	<br />
	Answer:&nbsp;Corrosion is but one of many fault that occur during the life of a wire or wire harness.&nbsp; Insulation aging, cracking, etc is yet another that significantly can affect useful life and is of interest in determining remaining useful life (RUL)<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>For &ldquo;predicting future faults&rdquo;, does it mean predicting future hard faults (open/short circuit of cable)? Or it just focuses on the prediction of future fault condition (like severity of degradation)?<br />
	<br />
	Answer:&nbsp;This is up to the proposer to determine their strategy and breath of capability.&nbsp; Within our own in-house effort we approach a problem with a crawl, walk, run attitude to ensure success.&nbsp; Predicting future hard faults is definitely of interest and makes up the holistic perspective of RUL.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Will you give some more details about &ldquo;intermittent faults&rdquo;? Some examples are also help.<br />
	<br />
	Answer:&nbsp;: Intermittent faults as understood are those as an example occur when a wire cracks or breaks but remains in contact sufficiently to conduct the current required for message traffic but for various reasons may break contact or resistance is greater than&nbsp;electric conditions to overcome this situation and thus appears to be no signal condition for that cable.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the Phase I work, will you provide an example configuration of the target complex wire assemblies?<br />
	<br />
	Answer:&nbsp;Our focus at this point is a simpler device that can be use by a technical soldier in the field to isolate wire fault versus a cable analyzer.&nbsp; The proposer can demonstrate on any US Army aviation or missile system wire/wire harness asset, or similar wire model.&nbsp; AvMC may be able to acquire old harness components for testing but the effort should not depend on acquiring such assets.</li>

Those simple faults include open and short circuits and deterioration such as corrosion. However, the current FMCW tool is not intended to be capable of predicting future faults.This STTR should 1) complement and capitalize on; and, 2) be distinct from the current FMCW tool.Complementary - this STTR shall complement the current FMCW by employing current FMCW work and architecture, while extending that architecture framework to enable statistical analysis of cables of different types and sizes.Distinct - this STTR shall be distinct from the current FMCW tool by predicting future faults in cables and analyzing complex types of cable degradation to allow for Prognostic and Predictive Maintenance (PPMx) capabilities.PROBLEM: The current standard operating procedures for cable fault detection and diagnosis are unable to detect, locate, and classify intermittent faults and corrosion in electrical wiring and connectors. They require invasive techniques to access, remove and/or disassemble the weapon system under test and analysis, and requires significant power and test equipment for this limited task. Many types of faults are hard to identify and replicate using these procedures and equipment, which leads to frequent ""No-Fault-Found"" test results in weapons system cable bundles (e.g., radar, intermediate missile, and aircraft).EFFORT: The goal is to capitalize and extend existing efforts and to develop test set consisting of a low power handheld unit suitable for one-person operation, displays measurement results for viewing by its operator, and records and preserves data for transmission and/or download to maintenance facility computers. The unit must be ruggedized for Army fielded operations in its final prototype form.

Current technologies employ advanced Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for feature generation and object classification. In pursuit of increased accuracy, state-of-the-art models have become increasingly complex, thereby introducing latency into the system. For many applications, some degree of latency is acceptable. However, there is an emerging set of operations where latency reduction is paramount as the decision-making process is currently too slow for autonomous systems to respond appropriately. This is especially true when dealing with complex environments and extremely fast-moving objects such as hypersonic vehicles.One solution for reducing latency is to offload some of the mathematical operations from the processor to the optics. For example, optical analog computation can be used to perform Fourier filtering for image contour detection. This operation produces an image directly on the focal plane that is composed only of contours, effectively performing an image differentiation calculation at the speed of light without any computational expense. In general, optical analog computation performs pre-processing steps that compress the image data and enable ML model solutions with fewer coefficients and lower latency compared with models used on raw data.One drawback of conventional optical analog systems is that they require bulky lenses and large volumes that are not suitable for SWAP-constrained platforms. A promising option to replace conventional optical elements and reduce SWAP is to employ ultra-thin meta-optic devices. Meta-optics, in contrast to bulky refractive optics, produce customized optical functions using subwavelength scatterers that provide abrupt spatially varying phase shifts. By engineering the geometry and arrangement of scatterers, meta-optics can be designed to perform complex mathematical transforms on the incoming light. When applied to ATR algorithms, these meta-optic operators could provide orders of magnitude reduction in latency while maintaining low size, weight, and power requirements for ATR platforms.In this program, the Army seeks to partner with a small business and university participant to investigate and develop meta-optic elements for optical analog computation. These elements will perform the computationally expensive operations of ATR algorithms, leading to significantly reduced latency and power requirements. Results from this effort would support a number of DoD programs and general performance objectives for the optical element include low SWAP, large bandwidth, low f-number, and high efficiency.",381,2766,1,No,No,No,,"Design a thin (<1mm) meta-optic device operating in the infrared (MWIR or LWIR) that performs a spatial differentiation operation.

These forthcoming electrolytes can accommodate greater electrochemical stability with increasing voltage, empowering safe engagement of high voltage materials. Development of battery cells with high operating voltage will augment energy and power densities of future lithium-ion batteries, as expressed by Ohm's law. Increased energy densities will prolongate battery run times or permit smaller batteries capable of comparable mission profiles, minimizing battery weight. Emphasis on these research areas is being proposed now due to the development, which we now know can achieve 5V cell voltages, leading to an opportunity to further enhance the military battery portfolio. Cells of higher operating voltages will also allow simultaneous utilization of electronics, benefitting large platform integration. Successful improvement of SSE and IL at high voltages would assist U.S. Army modernization priorities of Soldier Lethality, Future Vertical Lift, Next Generation Combat Vehicle, and Long Range Precision Fires. Incumbent LIBs fail to assuage the safety requirements for future soldier and vehicle platforms. Solid-state (inorganic solids, composites, polymers, etc.) and ionic liquid electrolytes exhibit improved safety compared to standard carbonate electrolytes due to amelioration of flammability and electrochemical stability issues when paired with lithium-metal anodes. Solid-state electrolytes, have potential to suppress detrimental lithium dendrite formation and provide desired mechanical and thermal stability. Safe electrolytes that enable safe operation with lithium metal anodes at high voltages will forge energy density improvements of 200-250%.Challenges to implementation include charge transfer impedance at the electrode-electrolyte interface that must be mitigated to promote rapid and reversible charge transfer. A feasible solution is the development of an artificial SEI layer to promote accelerated ion diffusion. Polymer electrolytes may exhibit poor adhesion to the solid electrode causing reduced electrolytic penetration into the electrodes, which proliferates resistance. Adding liquid electrolytes to counteract this process is effective but eliminates the safety advantages of the solid electrolytes and is not considered as a solution for this proposal. Additional hindrances for successful utilization of these electrolytes are ionic conductivities of electrolytes at room temperature and below. Electrolyte ionic conductivity is affected by temperature dependence of the viscosity of ionic liquids. The Army requires dependable operation of energy storage devices between -30&deg;C and +55&deg;C. Therefore, enhancing the ionic conductivity of these electrolytes for low temperature operation through use of additives or improved overall design is an additional research objective.Design goals for the resultant cells are listed below.

Therefore, the challenge for this topic is to exploit features of the SOOP waveforms designing innovative techniques in order to establish range to satellites and henceforth provide the user with the dismount/platform's position and current time (desired).The technology developed under this topic will result in an approach for LEO-PNT that is intended for dismounted Soldiers and Mounted vehicular applications, but may have further applications to aerial, munition and missile applications. The design will use a software defined receiver approach and be capable of incorporation as a component in the context of the Army's pntOS program enabling maximum application. This technology although designed to work standalone can be used to complement existing navigation sensors that are typically used in navigation systems, including GPS. Expansion to the usage of multiple constellations will serve to optimize performance and resiliency in an RF challenged environment. LEO satellites closer proximity to Earth and signal structures can allow for higher signal powers to reach the end user. Investigations conducted under this topic will include technical design approaches that will improve PNT performance (position and timing (desired) accuracy) and also the ability to operate in RF challenged environments such as dense urban, mountainous, forested and jungle environments. It's recognized that many implementations of SOOPs use reference stations in surveyed/fixed based locations. For most Army applications reference stations are undesirable due to the logistics burdening associated with manning the station, redeploying it as the unit maneuvers from location to location, emplacement/survey of the station to support operations and the required command and control for the system. A goal of this program is to develop a LEO PNT SOOP technical approach that will not require a reference station. However, cooperative PNT methods that share information using networks sharing information between unit platforms/members is encouraged. However, caution is required not to over burden the network.

The IR atmospheric transmission window of interest is in the range of ~8 - 13 um, i.e. long-wave IR (LWIR) and ~2 - 5 um, mid-wave IR (MWIR). In these spectral regimes, the IR radiation can be generated at the source and propagated to the target to disrupt its optical/IR sensors. However, there is a lack of suitable high-power sources in the MWIR and LWIR. High-average power, ultra-broad band radiation in this spectral regime can be generated by the spectral broadening and/or nonlinear parametric amplification of laser radiation in an appropriate nonlinear, lossless, material. Ultra-broad band radiation is generated from a laser pulse by a number of coupled highly nonlinear optical processes that include: i) self-phase modulation, ii) 4-wave mixing, iii) cross-phase modulation, iv) stimulated Raman scattering, and others. These mechanisms can lead to wide spectral broadening around the fundamental and other frequencies that may cover the MWIR and LWIR regimes with high overall conversion efficiencies. In addition, the IR radiation could have a high degree of directionality and thus can be propagated long distances within a small solid angle using an appropriate beam director. This topic seeks solutions that eliminate threats through the disruption of a target's optical control systems rather than destroying the target by thermal disruption mechanisms. Novel laser configurations, such as laser pulse formats and bandwidth manipulations that would generate ultra-broadband MWIR and LWIR radiation are of interest. The pump (source) lasers that generate the wideband radiation should be compact, reliable and commercially available.

Current state of the art allows for 100 pound units with carrying capacity of over 250 pounds, running on all terrain tires at speeds in excess of 50 mph with ranges in excess of 100 miles between charges. Would this be considered a potentially viable alternative to a UAV? It would seem that the best way to test the ground in question is to drive over it.
A: For Phase I (offline planning), the intent is to characterize the terrain using remote sensing before a vehicle drives over it so using a vehicle to characterize the soil wouldn&rsquo;t meet that intent.",,Sensors,1,Sensors,Autonomy,Autonomy,1,"infrared, sensing, autonomy, terramechanics, mobility, off-road, real time, unmanned ground vehicles",1,"infrared, sensing, autonomy, terramechanics, mobility, off-road, real time, unmanned ground vehicles",No,0,No,,"Develop methods to remotely acquire terrain strength data using infrared (IR) sensors that results in increased vehicle safety, mobility, and maneuverability compared to current approaches to off-road navigation.",28,"Develop methods to remotely acquire terrain strength data using infrared (IR) sensors that results in increased vehicle safety, mobility, and maneuverability compared to current approaches to off-road navigation.","The Army modernization priority identifies the autonomous maneuverability and off-road mobility of platforms as a critical research area [1]. Robust online remote terrain strength estimation is essential for autonomous ground vehicle mobility over off-road deformable terrains while offline remote terrain strength estimation enables route planning.In order to maximize performance in off-road settings, mobility planning needs to account for the interaction between the vehicle running gear and terrain surface. The most widely used models for force prediction on deformable terrains are the semi-empirical models based on Bekker's classical terramechanics theory [2]. These terramechanics models require inputs of terrain strength properties that vary spatially and temporally. Current methods to acquire these inputs rely on in-situ or satellite-based geographic information systems (GIS) data. Terrain strength data gathered in the theatre of operation may be of high quality and resolution but is resource intensive in terms of manpower and time, making it potentially infeasible for large areas of operation. On the other hand, satellite-based terrain data may be available for large geographic regions, however, these sources often lack the capacity and resolution required to make accurate mobility predictions of terrain strength at the vehicle level [3]. Further, both methods fail to provide means of updating a priori terrain strength data during field operations, resulting in poor vehicle mobility if terrain properties have changed due to seasonal effects, weather impacts, natural disasters, and even human adversarial activity.A novel method to obtain terrain strength relies on remote sensing using IR sensors placed on a ground vehicle or a UAV. Several benefits of this approach include the ability to collect data at vehicle-level resolution, quickly gather terrain strength information over large areas of operation, and automate the transmission and processing of sensor readings to be used during offline route planning before an operation or online mobility planning within an autonomous control system of the ground vehicle in real time. Recent studies have shown success in using hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing in estimating soil type and soil strength [4]. However, fundamental research questions need to be addressed to advance remote sensing for autonomous ground vehicle off-road mobility. These questions/topics include:-Relating remote sensor measurements such as hyperspectral and thermal images to terrain mechanical properties such as cohesion, friction, bearing, and cone index.-Scalability of the technology from small terrain area to large operational region.-Efficiency of the technology to produce data for online navigation of autonomous vehicles in faster than real time.-Robustness of the technology to operate successfully under varying weather and ground conditions as well as measurement uncertainty.-How to integrate the remotely sensed terrain strength parameters into the running gear force prediction models for autonomous ground vehicle systems towards online and offline path planning?-Quantitatively evaluate the benefit of integrating remotely sensed terrain strength parameters for autonomous path planning and validate the results.-Evaluate the robustness of the remotely sensed terrain strength parameters under varying terrain conditions and different soil types.",480,3432,1,No,No,No,,"Identify the components required to develop remote sensing capabilities for offline mobility planning. Offline planning entails collecting terrain data over a large area such that a Go/No-Go map can be generated prior to conducting a military operation in that region. Required components may include the test vehicle, potential UAV, IR sensors, and terramechanics models to predict vehicle-terrain interaction using inferred terrain mechanical properties from remote sensing. Conduct initial integration of the components to demonstrate feasibility. The deliverable will be proof-of-concept field demonstration using physical hardware integrated with software to showcase the application of remote terrain sensing to ground vehicle mobility predictions in deformable terrain under off-road conditions. The demonstration output shall be able to support a short vehicle traversal (<0.5 km) with nearly real time terrain information (within 24 hours of sensing terrain).","This phase would build upon the foundational efforts of Phase I. Extensive field testing across multiple soil types, varying environmental conditions such as increased moisture, and over large scale geometry will be conducted to evaluate the robustness of the approach, and if needed, employ methods to mitigate uncertainty in terrain strength estimations. Another task will be to update the remote sensing capability from an offline only implementation to online, meaning terrain strength will be remotely sensed and transmitted to an autonomous vehicle's control algorithm to inform its path planner that uses terramechanics soil models in real time or faster. Note that online remote terrain sensing shall be performed by having the sensors mounted on the autonomous ground vehicle itself. Also, mobility trials with and without remotely sensed terrain strength estimations will be conducted in order to quantify its impact on off-road performance. The deliverable will be a prototype autonomous vehicle with remote sensing capability through IR sensors that augment the path planner's decision making with terrain strength data in real time to improve mobility performance demonstrated across a wide range of military relevant conditions.","Work in Phase III would focus on collaborating with Army personnel to transition the developed methodology to the Army. Both optionally manned and unmanned vehicles aligned with the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program, as well as robotic and bridging programs within Project Manager Force Projection of Program Executive Office Combat Support and Combat Service Support, would directly benefit whether they use terrain data remotely sensed offline before an operation or online during a mission in conjunction with the autonomous control system. The technology would be tested to evaluate its accuracy and robustness, and to demonstrate its effectiveness to Army stakeholders. Furthermore in this phase, the technology can be extended to include sharing of sensed terrain data across multiple platforms (V2X communication).This technology would also provide commercial sectors the capability of enhanced off-road mobility. The mining industry is moving towards automated vehicles for their promise of increased safety and productivity [5] with similar trends observed in the agriculture sector for increased yields [6]. In addition, as space exploration becomes more privatized, companies would look towards advanced terrain navigation technologies to ensure the success of planetary missions [7].",1,"United States Army Modernization Strategy: Investing in the Future (2019);; Laughery, Sean C. et al.

The neXtECU, is a viable drop-in replacement controller option for the Abrams M1A2 along with other vehicle platforms such as the 1790 M88 Hercules. It is also currently used to support the development of the Advanced Combat Engine (ACE) and Powertrain (APD) upgrades. The advantages of the neXtECU are not only that it can be implemented on multiple vehicle platforms, but that it will also provide protection for the data it sends and stores. It is essential to adapt and implement cybersecurity protocols into the neXtECU for Army ground vehicles because of the exponential growth of technology and an increased rate of cyber-attacks by U.S. adversaries both foreign and domestic. Currently fielded engine controllers have limited to no cybersecurity protection which leaves them open for Malware, phishing, and possibly clandestine equipment. Without the increased cybersecurity technologies on the engine controller a vehicle can be manipulated by threats in a variety of different ways such as: interrupted flow of data, unauthorized commands to critical components which can endanger human life, and is a danger to critical and costly equipment. Compromised equipment can also lead to drastic increases in life-cycle costs, and can potentially negatively affect overall mission capabilities and success. The cybersecurity measures developed for the neXtECU will effectively protect, restrict, and encrypt data, protocols, and communication systems. The technological solution to be developed will be required to integrate a Hardware Security Module (HSM) with a 5777m processor into the neXtECU.

The cybersecurity technology will also enable the neXtECU's system integrity by keeping information from being altered which provides confidence that the system information is confidential, protected, and un-corrupted. The neXtECU has many benefits for the Army due to its wide application for all ground vehicles, and it can provide a solution to upcoming sustainment issues, cybersecurity, and capability enhancements.

The Army, more so than most other industries, has the need to additively manufacture large scale metallic components.

The topic details treatment options.&nbsp; Would a point of care Cortisol (stress) diagnostic test using any smartphone conform to this solicitation.&nbsp; In lieu of treatment, all warfighters would be tested at baseline and in different stressful situations.&nbsp; The commanders would know going in which warfighters are most likely to have stress related issues on the battlefield and can thus position&nbsp;their warfighters appropriately.
A: A diagnostic device would not be considered for this STTR.

Q3 (09/22/2021): Looks like the BAA has a typo in the very top header, just confirming that it&#39;s 21C as listed above and everywhere else.&nbsp; Sincerely, S. Steele

STTR 21.B Program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)&quot;

A: Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We&#39;ve pointed this out to the team that runs the DoD BAAs and have requested that they change this.

After looking through this, it is indeed the 21.C BAA, as it is the only BAA that the Army STTR program is participating in.",,Bio Medical,1,Bio Medical,General Warfighting Requirements (GWR),General Warfighting Requirements (GWR),1,"Traumatic stress, neuromodulation, neurofeedback, acute stress reaction, acute stress disorder",1,"Traumatic stress, neuromodulation, neurofeedback, acute stress reaction, acute stress disorder",No,0,No,,Develop a non-invasive device that either 1) prevents functional impairment due to an Acute Stress Reaction (ASR) or 2) returns Soldier to performance following the occurrence an ASR.,28,Develop a non-invasive device that either 1) prevents functional impairment due to an Acute Stress Reaction (ASR) or 2) returns Soldier to performance following the occurrence an ASR.,"Mental health symptoms stemming from severe stress exposure during deployment degrade performance and compromise the safety of Soldiers and their teams in far forward operational environments. In 2018, 28% of medical evacuations were attributed to mental health-related symptoms (Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch, 2018). Anticipated conditions of the future battlefield will increase the cognitive demands on Soldiers, and it is expected that the incidence of severe stress exposures, and thus mental health symptoms, will escalate. Soldiers will be operating in small teams for prolonged periods without ready access to tactical or medical support due to communication-interfering capabilities of adversaries and other limitations of the operational environment. These conditions will increase exposure to severely stressful situations, prolong the amount of time Soldiers must cope with severe stress reactions, and magnify the opportunity for decrements in performance to put personal safety and the mission at risk. Therefore, it might be expected that the incidence of ASR will increase. An ASR is a normal response to a severe physical or mental stressor, such as combat, that results in maladaptive emotional, cognitive, somatic, and/or behavioral symptoms during the first 1-3 days following a traumatic event. Unfortunately, there are currently no FDA-approved treatments for ASR. Further, existing treatments for trauma-related disorders such as PTSD have limited efficacy in Soldiers and take 4-6 weeks to reach effects. It is therefore critical to develop safe and effective interventions to support Soldier performance prior to, during, and after severe stress exposure during combat operations. Additionally, treatments for ASR should not result in significant cognitive, motor or other functional side effects, act rapidly to sustain Soldier performance, and be safely administered in operational environments as part of pre-hospital care. This STTR aims to develop a non-invasive device that could be used in training prior to, during, or immediately following a traumatic stress exposure to maintain Soldier performance in an operational environment. The deliverable must function in a range of environments (e.g., laboratory, operational training, in garrison, and far forward deployment settings) where smartphone usage, service, and internet availability is variable. In the context of multi-domain operations, internet, electronic, or blue tooth connectivity will not be likely.",357,2506,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will focus on development of performance parameters and initial concept testing for a prototype device. Performer should develop a plan for a practical deployment, use of the prototype in different environments (e.g., in lab, in garrison, training, deployed settings) where there is variable access to electronic or internet connectivity. Primary performance parameters to be considered for devices that will be utilized as preventative treatments include level of efficacy in maintaining baseline performance, preventing the occurrence of stress-related symptoms, training time needed, ease of use, retention time of treatment effects, impact on functional performance, portability, maintenance requirements and network requirements. Performance parameters to be considered for devices that will be utilized as pre-hospital treatments include level of efficacy in restoring performance and/or reducing stress-related symptoms, time to reach treatment effects, FDA market authorization (if applicable), ease of use, retention time of treatment effects, impact on functional performance, portability, maintenance requirements, network requirements, production costs, and maintenance costs. Finally, this phase will produce a virtual or in-person demonstration of device function based on established performance parameters.","Phase II will focus on creating a field-testable prototype that meets the criteria determined in Phase I. The aim will be to demonstrate proof-of-concept by developing, testing, and refining a prototype. In order to accomplish this Phase II testing and evaluation, the objectives for human subject research for testing and data acquisition must be defined. A research protocol aimed at validating the prototype in a laboratory setting should evaluate the capabilities of the prototype through limited human testing in laboratory research. The laboratory testing should demonstrate that the device is able to 1) effectively prevent decrements in performance on operationally relevant tasks or increased stress symptoms following training and stressor administration in a laboratory setting or 2) effectively restore performance on operationally relevant tasks or stress symptoms following stressor administration in a laboratory setting. During this phase, the stressor administration does not need to be a traumatic stressor, but can utilize a well-validated model of human laboratory stress. The stress and measures of performance should be as operationally relevant and translatable to military stress and operational performance as are feasible. A regulatory strategy should be put in place if applicable, including a pre-submission meeting with the FDA to assist with protocol design.","Phase III will focus on refinement of the device prototype, based on evaluation data obtained in Phase II, in order to create a final production-ready system. The full functionality of this final device will be evaluated within an operational field environment. For devices that will be utilized as preventative treatments, effectiveness will be evaluated using baseline performance metrics gathered prior to training with the device and an appropriate comparison group may be determined based on device specifications and with input from the FDA. For devices that will be utilized as pre-hospital treatments, effectiveness will be evaluated using an appropriate comparator based on the device specifications and with input from the FDA, as appropriate. The vision for this capability is to have a device that can be used during pre-deployment training to prevent an ASR or for pre-hospital treatment of ASRs during combat. Defense R&D funding may be obtained in coordination with an advanced developer, such as US Army Medical and Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) Warfighter Brain Health Project Management Office, to expedite the technology transition from the laboratory to operational use. As applicable, the company will develop a quality management system and regulatory strategy for FDA marketing application submission. This effort will deliver a product that is broadly usable by the DoD for prevention or treatment of ASR. The final product should be presented to applicable DoD representatives and program managers for transition to use in military environments. Further, the utility of this a non-invasive device may be relevant to industry, academia, and the general public for the potential treatment of other trauma-related disorders, pending additional FDA marketing authorizations. Awardees must outline a commercialization pathway including, but not limited to, regulatory strategy, marketing strategy, consumer feedback, and sales.",1,"Armed, Forces Health Surveillance Branch.

Advances have been made in producing and drawing films from difficult-to-process polymers with exceptional properties, such as ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene. These materials have already advanced the state of protective soldier protective systems, such as with the development of the advanced combat Helmet Gen II.1 In addition to achieving preferential orientation of base polymers, researchers have demonstrated formation of nanocomposite films with exceptional properties. Optimization of film processing parameters can be greatly aided by laboratory techniques that allow better fundamental understanding of the structural evolution of polymer films during post-stretching processing; recent advances in synchrotron radiation (SR) light sources and detection techniques allow measurement of the polymer's changing morphology in real time with the use of a combination of small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS). These studies can be used to create process-structure-property databases that can be used as the basis for model discovery and combined with artificial intelligence techniques to rapidly converge on optimal processing conditions, rather than using traditional trial and error techniques.2 There are compelling indications that oriented films may provide superior ballistic performance to oriented fibers made of the same polymer. Around 2007, several manufacturers began producing a solid state extruded film made from ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene. The ballistic performance of this film was noted to be higher than expected given its low tensile strength relative to its ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene fiber counterpart (3,4). Oriented films such as uniaxially oriented polypropylene have also shown promise for transparent armor.5 The technical challenge of meeting optical transmittance and clarity requirements for transparent armor while providing a high level of ballistic protection is much more significant than for opaque armor. Thus, transparent oriented films with improved ballistic performance are of particular interest in this topic.",321,2343,1,No,No,No,,Phase I of the program should demonstrate feasibility of the technical approach and development of the initial material concept. Offerer will select materials for candidate films and explore processing mechanisms for creating oriented films with superior properties. Materials can include base polymers as well as additives. The focus of Phase I is to demonstrate the ability to enhance the properties of the base polymer film through processing and use of additives. Measurements to characterize the film material's morphology and correlate it to processing conditions and to mechanical properties should be performed in Phase 1.Technologies will be evaluated for transition to Phase II based on improved tensile strength and modulus values. U* may also be used to evaluate performance advancement. 6,"Phase II should focus on material production to generate prototypes for ballistic evaluation. The PI will develop materials and processes to fabricate ballistic flat panels at areal densities from about 0.5 pounds per square foot (psf) up to about 1.0 psf. At a minimum, materials for opaque armor should be tested for V50 against 17 grain fragment simulating projectile (FSP). Transparent materials should be tested for transmissivity, haze, scratch resistance, and V50 against 17 grain and 5.8 grain fsp (0.125 inch thich samples). Final deliverables should include a cost estimate for scale up and production of the material, technical data package, prototypes for evaluation by the Government and a final report.","Phase III should focus on scale up of the material product and building prototype components to demonstrate appropriate applications of the material. For opaque armor, prototype components could include helmets and/or ceramic plate armor backings. Lenses or visors should be the focus for transparent material applications. While the animus for this topic is improved ballistic protection at the dismounted soldier level, the technology may be extrapolated for broader military use. Improved materials may also be of commercial interest for non-DoD protective and security services.",1,"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/03/30/army-shows-off-its-lightest-combat-helmet-ever.html;; Kim, Jun Young, 'Carbon Nanotube-Reinforced Thermotropic Liquid Crystal Polymer Nanocomposites', Materials 2009, 2, 1955-1974.;; University of Warwick.

Demonstrate this IR-functional coating on a UAV in a relevant environment.","In multi-domain operations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) widely operate as an extension of the Warfighter and squad, enabling much better situational awareness. UAVs are also used commercially for transporting loads, monitoring networks, and many other civilian applications. More widespread infrared (IR) imaging capabilities among adversaries means that it is increasingly easy to identify UAVs during operation, reducing their effectiveness and compromising the mission. Due to both increased use of UAVs and increased access to IR imaging capabilities by adversaries, there is a strong and emerging need for coatings to protect UAVs from detection by reducing the expected maximum range to image. However, many of the available coatings that could protect the UAVs from detection, especially in the IR/ visible (optical) ranges, contain materials that are toxic and bad for the environment; e.g., isocyanates.Nature has enabled sophisticated color schemes in the animal kingdom, including bright and dark tones for camouflage. Bio-inspired materials have been extensively researched in the academia, and bio-inspired coatings fabricated with the ability to mask signature, and even regulate temperature, as Nature does. Simultaneously, bio-inspired materials and biomaterials are being explored in synthetic biology, enabling US manufacturing to be simpler, more environmentally friendly, use less toxic materials, and be less dependent on rare materials imported from few foreign nations. The DoD and Army must bring more environmentally friendly and less toxic materials into its supply chain, and is required to make surface coating products and processes that are more Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) sustainable.The goal of this topic is to develop an innovative coating with infrared functionality - managing both signature and thermal properties/temperature - for a small UAV that accompanies the Warfighter and is capable of reconnaissance missions. ""Infrared functionality"" includes passive (and active, i.e. actuated heat release port, etc) temperature control. Emissions must be controlled in the longwave IR (LWIR) or thermal IR, as specified quantitatively below. While the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave (SWIR) infrared are not a focus of this Topic, a coating that is successful for both military and commercial applications must also manage optical properties (e.g., reflectivity and absorption) in these spectral ranges. Batteries, operating as hot as 60&deg;C, and motors, will contribute hotspots to a UAV's thermal image. UAVs can be observed at distances ~ 100m with IR cameras [1], even when not visually observable. Advanced gimballed, large detection systems could image UAVs at shorter range. Bio-inspired materials, like bio-pigments, exhibit strong IR scattering and high refractive indices, and could strongly affect IR images of a passive coating [2]; these materials have been introduced into fibers. Coatings could be smooth and paint-like, or on fibers and/or textile-like material (i.e. [3]), possibly adding IR functionality, but they must be robust to withstand continuous flights at the rated velocity of the UAV, through different weather conditions. Coatings must have lower ESOH risk than traditional DoD paints, which can no longer contain materials like hexavalent chromium. Polyethylene is an example of one environmentally-interesting material, proposed for thermal and color management [4].",498,3468,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a feasibility study by identifying, through early stage experiments and modeling (not just modeling), a coating that can be used to trap heat inside a UAV that is conformal, paint-like, and does not have significant ESOH risk for use by operators and manufacturers; for example, a bio-inspired material with backwards infrared scattering centers. Deliver coated samples of representative UAV body elements (wings, battery encasements, motor hubs, etc.) with experimental results demonstrating IR absorption/reflection properties that indicate potential range reduction for LWIR camera-based detection/imaging below 100m. Model potential performance improvements relevant to increased operating temperature for UAV, and possibly LWIR imaging degradation. Model weight of coating for an entire UAV and any effects on aerodynamics of the UAV. Document results of experiments and modelling in a report.","Building on Phase I work, in Year 1 of Phase II: demonstrate a prototype, consisting of a fully coated UAV using a coating with low ESOH risk, and demonstrate in a lab environment the coating's effect on LWIR imaging (using a LWIR camera) of the UAV, degrading images taken at more than 100 m. Also in Year 1, demonstrate improvement to operating temperature range (e.g., any thermal management improvements). In Year 2, include in the prototype a way to mitigate temperature swings of the UAV; e.g., release heat if internal temperature becomes too high; for example, opening a heat exhaust port (""heat valve"") at the back of the UAV temporarily to reduce heat load inside the UAV. In Year 2, the 100 m maximum LWIR range must be improved, any leakage of elevated UAV body temperature into the SWIR range considered, and some temperature control demonstrated. Ideally in Year 2, conduct a toxicological assessment of any new materials used in the coating, with Army Public Health Command. Report ESOH impact and weight of the optimized coating, including potential new heat valve, and demonstrate minimal effects on aerodynamics of UAV and plan for mitigating any heat build-up in warmer environments. Demonstrate coating is as resilient to environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, rain, etc) as uncoated UAV body elements, or report on the reduction in operating ranges for these properties, ideally in a relevant environment (the full system must be demonstrated at least in a laboratory environment). Deliver full prototype of coated UAV to the government. Document results of experiments and modelling in reports for both Year 1 and Year 2. Comment in the reports about the tradeoffs of using a low ESOH-risk passive coating vs. active approaches to avoid detection like use of scattering agents in a released gas.","Scale the technology demonstrated in Phase II up to a level that produces a full system that could be used in an operationally relevant environment for the Army. Demonstrate reduced IR signature and improved operating temperature range in this environment. Dual use potential for coating comes in two principle areas (1) its use for IR concealment and (2) its use for thermal regulation. (1) Coated UAVs could be marketed to law enforcement (police, department of homeland security, etc.) for its ability to provide UAV concealment to improve surveillance applications. Licensing to or partnering with existing UAV manufacturers in this commercial space would be ideal. (2) Coated UAVs and coatings could also be marketed to widespread commercial applications (agriculture, delivery services, photography, cinematography, hobbyists) on the basis of improving thermal regulation of the UAV in cold environments. Many users face issues from temperatures being too cold for batteries of flight computers to operate normally, reducing mission and flight times.",1,"Night-time Detection of UAVs Using Theral Infrared Camera; Andrasi; Radisic; Mustra; Ivosevic; Vol. 28; 2017; 183-190;; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146517311043;; Natural light-scattering nanoparticles enable visible through short-wave infrared color modulation in cephalopods Adv.

Q3 (04/21/2022): Respected Sir,

I am one of the applicants interested in developing reprioritization of targets for safe long-range weapons. Typical&nbsp;range and the time duration for the weapon to stay is air are useful inputs to determine if it is supersonic or hypersonic.&nbsp;Or, we can develop a proof-of-concept.&nbsp;Fin controlled weapon after fire controls gets depleted with energy quickly as it is meant for short range. Also lift is not availabe with them. Therefore, shall we assume a jet powered 6DOF UAV type of configuration as a weapon to cover range and&nbsp;meneuver capabilities? Are we required to&nbsp;blend&nbsp;seeker autonomy capabilities in the terminal phase for precision? Lastly, if human observer is not reprioritizing the target, do we expect the weapon to have some intelligence based on situational awareness? Sorry if these are too many questions. Thank you in advance for sharing your valable time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The first scenario involves target information that is to be modified based on reprioritization of targets. The second scenario addresses the delay of target information either because the precise target location is initially unavailable, because the target is moving, or because the munition's destination is to be concealed from enemy forces. The third scenario involves guiding the munition real time to the target through an operator or an autonomous system. The delivered technology will enable the munition to sense, geolocate, and relay target and munition data from multiple sources to fire control and battle management systems.The proposed technology should also provide the means to transmit actual position data that can be used by onboard navigational system to determine if the GPS signal is being spoofed and to take appropriate corrective action.",141,947,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a systematic feasibility study of the proposed methods using analytical and computer modeling and simulation and well as proof-of-concept prototyping of the basic components of the system and laboratory testing to determine if they have the potential of meeting the all the requirements for use in munitions, UAVs and UGVs that are to be provided to the Phase I awardees.

The data transition across engineering lifecycle phases occurs sequentially with disparate tools and models, resulting in time lost and rework. The integration of such tools was cost prohibitive. However, the proliferation of emerging technologies make this goal more achievable today. Using ontologies and ontological methods and software tools to create and mine data sources provides an opportunity for tool agnostic integration that is flexible and powerful. An ontology-based system opens up the power of triple store and semantic web-based technologies to empower our tools and their integration. Such a solution could leverage a domain specific ontology, REST APIs, ETL technology, and visualization technologies, see references [1-5]. Basic research efforts have advanced the utility of ontologies and established frameworks and tools to achieve this end state for DE. For example, Hagedorn et al describe one such framework in [6]. These tools are currently emerging and have not yet been fully matured as should be expected. There is a need to further develop these tools to a maturity (usability and security being of highest concern) required for use in government and commercial organizations.With investment, we will link together tools for requirements, architecture, design, analysis, acquisition, manufacturing, and fielding, eliminate delays and errors from translating design data between tools and steps. A federated set of data will serve as the single source of truth and change(s) will translate through all levels and tools. The resultant technology supports OSD's Digital Engineering and Data strategies; improving engineering effectiveness and efficiency across all Army Modernization Priorities. Government estimates of improvement show expected reduction in process time from 33-66% varying by process type and program complexity. These solutions have transition potential as an enterprise solution for the DEVCOM/AFC, as an industry solution, and as a manufacturing solution amongst our production. As such, transition partners would include Joint Program Executive Office Armaments & Ammunition (JPEO A&A) including Product Director Joint Services (PD JS), Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (JMTC), and Watervliet Arsenal (WVA). The DE solution shall demonstrate the following characteristics and requirements:The solution shall enable the conduct of coupled physics-based analysis of multiple types with multiple toolsThe solution shall perform impact analysis conducted in the event of a request for waiver or change with traceability through design, architecture, and requirementsThe solution shall execute a virtual evaluation of a modified system including determination of data needs and conduct of applicable analyses.The solution shall be tool agnostic and integrate with existing tools with minimal user interventionThe solution shall share data maintaining and ensuring a federated authoritative data source,The solution shall include validated toolsThe solution shall comply with or be able to comply with IT and cyber security requirements applicable to the environment, see [7].With investment, the AFC and our partners will be able to link together tools for requirements, architecture, design, analysis, acquisition, manufacturing, and fielding. We will eliminate delays and errors associated with translating a design into an engineering analysis tool, then into a technical data package format, then into a manufacturing file, into a 3D rendering in a tech manual, and then back to the design authority via as-built parametric models to facilitate production, sustainment, and demil support. A single data element will serve as the single source of truth and a change will translate through all levels and associated tools. The resultant technology supports OSD's Digital Engineering and Data strategies; improving engineering effectiveness and efficiency across all Army Modernization Priorities. Government estimates of improvement show expected reduction in process time from 33-66% varying by process type and program complexity. These technology solutions will have powerful transition potential as a local solution for the AC, as an enterprise solution for the DEVCOM/AFC, as an industry solution with our partners, and as a manufacturing solution amongst our production base (first through the Armaments GOCO's).

As such, transition partners would include Joint Program Executive Office Armaments & Ammunition (JPEO A&A) including Product Director Joint Services (PD JS) for their GOCO mission, Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center (JMTC), and Watervliet Arsenal (WVA).

Ultimately, these tools will enable the realization of modernization at the speed of relevance. Engineering can truly be concurrent, utilizing a single data source to simultaneously design, analyze, plan for manufacturing, and establish logistics products thus reshaping the acquisition process from a serial process of handoffs to a truly rapid, agile, and concurrent process.

The communication between two or more nodes, requires the transmission of information and recovery of the transmitted information using radio frequency means. As a result, the transmitted sensory information, or the electronic communication between two or more nodes may be detected or jammed by an adversary. The nodes may be a weapon platform and one or more munitions, UAVs, UAGs, fire control stations, and the like.The initial feasibility studies have shown that information from sensors or information from two nodes or more could be inserted within the noise envelope using novel methods and be completely recovered at every receiving node, even in the presence of interference and noise and significantly better than any conventional methods. When polarization was added to the developed method, the analysis shows a significant increase in resistance to detection, jamming and spoofing. Such secure and communication capability between weapon platforms and other fire control platforms and munitions is critical for ensuring that the information cannot be detected, jammed, or spoofed and that the munition can be guided to its target with high precision and maximum lethality.

Although there are government-owned and commercial C2 simulation systems available, none of them offer the necessary combination of very high-speed execution, multi-domain richness, and specialized interfaces for AI/ML applications. The speed and complexity of MDO against a peer adversary are likely to exceed the cognitive abilities of a human command staff in conventional, largely manual C2 processes. At the same time, emerging applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) [1] [2] begin to suggest the potential to support C2 of MDO. Recently there has been a growing interest in the DOD community, including military departments, unified combatant commands and defense agencies like DARPA to research and develop C2 AI techniques, specifically DRL based techniques that can learn to seek, create, and jointly exploit Windows of Superiority (WoS), a key element of the MDO paradigm. To converge multi-domain friendly assets on a WoS, the C2 agents will learn to perform complex (re)planning on shortened timelines, quickly offer suggestions, and test alternative Course of Actions (COAs). Developing these agents will require a simulator engine(s) of appropriate fidelity since DRL-derived policies are fundamentally limited to the experiences that is available. This topic looks at developing a simulation environment that can generate scenarios which cover all relevant domains/ capabilities that an AI-enabled C2 system is expected to manage, rapidly produce large amounts of training data for ML algorithms, run much faster than real-time and support massive parallelization in order to make the learning process tractable within operational timelines. From an operational perspective for future MDO, it is envisioned that a comprehensive AI-based C2 system will create high-fidelity simulations of combat scenarios within a short duration of time. AI agents will be trained in the simulator and deployed on the field to generate predictions, decisions, and commands at multiple levels of abstraction. These AI-enabled solutions will also work collaboratively with humans within command posts to ensure that data collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination is efficient and timely to enable rapid and accurate decision-making. Currently, the C2 simulation environments such as OpSim [3], DXTRS [4], OneSAF [5] mostly provide war gaming, Course of Action (CoA) implementation in the traditional physical domains and are not tailored towards developing AI applications. They do not have the provision to communicate/interface with AI algorithms, adjust resources, scale the computation to generate experiences and incorporate humans into the AI-C2 loop. In summary, the goal of the SBIR is to research and develop an integrated simulated battle space that address current limitations in training and testing AI systems for C2 with and without human-in-the-loop.",454,3090,1,No,No,No,,"The Phase I research effort shall focus on conceptualizing a brigade level model-based C2 simulation environment prototype with Land, Air, and Sea domains that runs 1,000 times faster than real-time/actual mission time. This simulation environment will consist of both a stochastic simulator based on a provided CoA and an OpenAI gym compatible iterative interface for training DRL algorithms that allows every entity in a simulation to be controlled as a separate agent. The vendor shall allow the user to modify observations, actions, rewards, metrics and interactions produced by the simulator. The software shall be designed to execute multiple independent instances on each node of a multi-node system and collect experience through parallel data collection. A typical unit of measurement for evaluating C2 environment performance is the amount of time required to perform a C2 function or known as a Boyd's Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop, is the OODA time. An OODA military task using training data suggest that various C2 environments will execute a task between 5 to 30 seconds depending on the complexity of the task and the C2 environment [6][7]. The performer shall develop proof of concept that AI agents trained in the simulator shall produce similar or improved OODA time. Further, the performers shall produce experimental/analytical results to demonstrate the ability of AI agents trained in the simulator to produce improved values for intermediate goals such as casualties, fuel and ammunition consumption, movement when compared to the CoA designed by expert CoA designers. In addition, the deliverable for Phase I shall include detail documentation on problem description, current limitations, conceptual design, architectural overview, methodology, modules, analytical/experimental critical function and a detailed prototype development plan for Phase II (TRL 2).","The initial part of Phase II shall involve building a prototype based on the concept/methodology conceived in Phase I and meeting the performance criteria described in Phase 1. Further, the simulator will be extended to cyber, electronic warfare (EW) and space domains with the ability to depict communication and information flows at very high resolution. The overall fidelity and realism in simulation will be increased by incorporating weather, sensors, terrain interactions, and environmental attributions. Phase II shall also involve development of a next-generation XR user interface that can alter the battlespace by receiving input from the human user for handling human-in/on-the-loop interactions. The user latency of the interface will be less than 7 ms. The Phase II deliverable shall be an end-to-end software prototype of a multi-domain high-fidelity simulation environment, AI interface, and low latency XR user interface. At the end of phase II, DRL based agents shall be implemented in the simulation and at least 70% of AI re-planning recommendations on scenarios jointly developed by concept writers and stakeholders shall be assessed as reasonable by expert human jurors (TRL 5).","The software shall be extended to improve the run time to 10,000 times faster than real-time. The integrated system shall have the capability to simulate MDO at multiple echelons including squad, platoon, brigade, division and corp. The simulation system shall be implemented on DOD's advanced supercomputing capability and evaluated using DRL algorithms and human participants on scenarios jointly developed by concept writers and stakeholders. In terms of the Army's modernization priorities, this software infrastructure will contribute to the three core tenets of multi-domain operations &ndash; calibrated force posture, multidomain formations, and convergence and is critical for multiple Cross Functional Teams (CFTs) including Network Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence (C3I), Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) and Air and Missile Defense (AMD). Other commercial application include R & D and operational simulation infrastructure for planning and decision making during humanitarian assistance, disaster response and emergency management.

Q2 (04/25/2022): Sir,

We have been engaged in&nbsp;brain modeling for quite some time using time and frequency analysis results

not available in&nbsp;the literature. We have successfully simulated how perception&nbsp;can code DNA helix for base

pair which is the sole molecule responsible for brain signaling. As we know, battlefield brain signals are

responsible for physiological and psychological problems in human warfighters. My question to you is, is it

worth generating brain signals first for a battlefield mosaic which we can take up later for evaluations and

adaptations to the battlefield. Thanks.

This SBIR topic is intended to introduce new technology to improve aid triggering that is not presently known to exist. Proposals will posit physio measures that can be sensed, processed, and used as triggers to aid user only when the user needs help. The research question is: &ldquo;How can physiological indicators from a user be used to improve AI-user collaborative performance?&rdquo; The contractor will need to provide a proposal outlining a plan for how technological innovations can be used to: (1) sense pertinent physiological data from the user; (2) transform these data into meaningful digital signatures; (3) detect and set cutoffs to determine whether the physiological states indicate a need for cognitive intervention to aid goal completion in the form of adaptive automation; and (4) provide solutions to how AI can aid a militarily relevant task (e.g., convoy route-planning, threat assessment from military intelligence, command and control, etc.) when the user is struggling as indicated by poor performance or physiological indicators. Physiological measures are often associated with different cognitive processes and therefore may act as triggers for adaptive automation meant to aid the user. Physiological measures are objective (i.e., not involving subjective opinions of the user), and therefore plausible options for AI triggers. The goal of this SBIR initiative is to develop a system that can: (1) sense output from the user for two of five identified physiological variables; (2) assess two of five distinct cognitive variable states; (3) set quantitative thresholds for each of the variables (via physiological assessment) at which the system engages or disengages adaptive automation, (4) implement at least one adaptive automation application using any two of the five physiological variables, and (5) demonstrate task performance increases through empirical testing.",351,2358,1,No,No,No,,"The end of Phase I should produce several outcomes in the range of TRL2-3. (1) Identification of five target physiological measures that relate to specific cognitive variables with at least two citations corroborating these conclusions. (2) Proposed ranges for the two most promising physiological variables that would indicate a need for triggering adaptive automation based on literature search or pilot testing and consultation with ARL researchers. (3) One citation and description of technology that senses and records two of the five chosen physiological measures. (4) An explanation and justification for a plan to leverage each of the existing technologies to process measures in real time. (5) A plan to form new technology which can record and process in real-time minimally two of the five physiological variables that have not previously been recorded simultaneously in the same device. The integration of physiological variables is a particular challenge as physiological variables often differ on the time scale in which they may be collected and analyzed from tens of milliseconds to seconds. These five points need to be incorporated into a report at the end of Phase I that also: (1) Discusses the project's problem space and current limitations to demonstrate full understanding of what needs to be solved; (2) Explains a methodology to overcome challenges and limitations; (3) Provides a conceptual design of the problem solution with anticipated performance at the end of Phase II, and (4) Outlines what will be done in Phase II. A successful report will demonstrate a path forward for using physiological variables from the user to give technology critical inputs to understanding when and how the user can be helped when challenged. Therefore, a successful Phase I will make a strong argument that the two chosen physiological variables are measurable and are predictive of the associated cognitive states.","The end of Phase II should produce several outcomes in the range of TRL 4-5. (1) Methods of measuring and processing two of the five physiological variables that relate to each cognitive state isolated in Phase 1. (2) One working demonstration for each measure with a display representing a near-real-time assessment of the measure. (3) One working demonstration of at least three of the physiological measures in an Army-oriented task and scenario in which the user's physiological state triggers adaptive automation. The task must involve decision-making regarding uncertainty as this a major focus area for Artificial Intelligence in general and particularly in Multi-Domain Operations. (4) A demonstrated ability to transfer adaptive automation trigger data to a third-party software. (5) Recommendations and paths forward for implementing adaptive automation based on the remaining physiological measures. The contractors should work toward the following benchmarks to enhance the odds of Phase III investment: (1) Flexibility of approach to account for numerous tasks (e.g., air traffic control, Army training programs, surveillance and sentry duties, security screening); (2) Resiliency of equipment to continue working in rugged conditions; (3) Ability to detach and stay powered when in environments without ready power sources; (4) Capability to interface with a range of secondary systems; (5) Capability to transition technology for commercialization to industry and possible Army applications; (6) Robust statistical procedures to account for large variability in physiological recordings; and (7) Plan for data sharing and use of experimental data, particularly for use by government personnel. A successful conclusion to Phase II will demonstrate technology that can predict through two physiological-variable inputs when a user needs help and experimental results showing the efficacy of the equipment with at least a 0.6 Area Under Curve (AUC) improvement in performance.","At the conclusion of the SBIR, the contractor will be well positioned to offer numerous technological applications for end users in both the commercial and military domains. In particular, the contractor may design adaptive automation for mental workload intensive jobs such as Intensive Care Unit monitoring and coordination, air traffic control, sports psychology, tutoring system development, pandemic responses, and military intelligence analysis. When physiological measures indicate difficulties with cognitive processing in any of these domains, adaptive automation may be triggered to ease the cognitive burden associated with performance of duty and thus improve outcomes. In the end, the contractor should be positioned to produce one or more potential commercial technologies that could be inserted into defense systems. The market contains many examples of work processes that involve users engaging with smart technology and computers. Following a successful Phase II, award winner can use the knowledge gained and technology created to optimize any number of these processes with adaptive automation using physiological sensors attached to the end user and deliver improved AI-user collaborators performance across a host of tasks and jobs.",1,"Byrne, E.A., Parasuraman, R.: Psychophysiology and adaptive automation.

However, high cost, bulkiness, and power requirement limitations in commercially available UV single photon detectors (UV-SPD), such as photomultiplier tubes and intensified charge coupled device cameras, hinder system development.This topic is interested in novel research and development towards demonstrating compact, UV single-photon-counting detectors (UV-SPD) sensitive in spectral range between 200 &ndash; 375 nm. The devices should have high single photon detection efficiency (SPDE) in the UV spectrum from 200-375 nm and low dark count rate density (DCRD), while also being visible-blind, compact and operable at room-temperature or using a compact thermo-electric cooler. Of particular interest are semiconductor based solutions based upon device architectures that include avalanche photodiodes (APDs), charge-coupled devices or phototransistors. For example, silicon (Si)-based SPDs have been demonstrated with low dark count rates (~ 25 Hz) but their response both drops off at wavelengths shorter than 400 nm and exhibits strong out-of-band signal [1] . Improvement requires addressing surface recombination effects and exploring novel device designs to increase carrier collection while suppressing long wavelength response [2]. While there are extensive reports on high multiplication gain measured in wide-bandgap APDs based on SiC or GaN operating in linear mode, there are fewer results on single-photon-counting operation; these studies report dark count probability at least 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than that of Si devices [3-4]. Improvements could be achievable through approaches that build on nascent research advances in the infrared that can be implemented with wide-bandgap heterostructures. Of interest would be internal amplification mechanisms (such as carrier avalanche processes) that produce very low noise suitable for single-photon counting. In particular, advances such as those made using digital alloys [5], staircase based APDs [6], or other novel amplification schemes needed to surpass photomultiplier performance (signal to noise) would be considered (although not required). Other interests include advances in circuitry to operate the detector and count in Geiger mode.",366,2678,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate through design, modelling, and/or experimental measurements the ability to produce a UV-SPD that can have a SPDE greater than 15% over a 50 nm region within the spectral range between 200-375 nm, > 3 orders of magnitude UV-visible rejection, and with a DCRD less than 1 MHz/mm^2 and a maximum count rate > 1 MHz. Designs should operate at room temperature or employ a compact thermo-electric cooler and ultimately fit in a package no larger than 90 mm x 90 mm x 40 mm (not including power supply). Initial device functionality should be demonstrated showing a path to meet all requirements within Phase 2. Circuit design considerations for photon counting should be made. Concepts at the end of this phase should achieve a maturity of TRL 2-3.","Using designs developed in Phase 1, demonstrate UV-SPDs meeting all the requirement defined in Phase 1. In this phase, performers will design, fabricate, and test their device concept and provide a report on the results as well as deliver the UV-SPD to the US Government for evaluation. Devices developed in this phase should achieve a maturity of TRL 4 &ndash; device with basic optical package and with a functional photon counting circuitry demonstration that can fit within specified size constraints.","A complete detector module suitable for sensor integration should be demonstrated based upon devices developed in phase 2. The size of the housing should be smaller than 90 mm x 90 mm x 40 mm and contain all necessary focusing optics and filters for operation. The module should provide standard output to enable integration into a sensor such as the transistor-transistor-logic standard or another equivalent industrial standard. Potential sensors for integration include Raman spectrometers, scintillation detectors, water-quality monitors, combustion control systems, arc-flash detectors, atom based quantum systems, chemical-biological detectors or other environmental sensors.",1,"Hadfield, R.

Several air surveillance capabilities in the form of traditional Radar systems operating at X-band and below as well as active and passive infrared and optical systems are tasked to solve the issue of providing a robust air picture, with limited success in a stressing and congested environment. The upper region of the extremely high frequency millimeter wave band is loosely defined for frequencies between 100 and 300 GHz. This band has shown promising potential for imaging and high-resolution Radar applications. However, those have been limited to very short ranges of centimeters to meters due to the lack of a transmitter that can amplify a waveform in this band to meaningful levels for Radar applications. Other major parts of a high frequency millimeter wave Radar systems exist to include continuous wave and pulsed signal generators, frequency mixers, antennas, and super heterodyne receivers. What remains is the high power amplifier to complete the hardware requirements for a Radar system. It is the goal of this project to push the technology of high frequency millimeter wave Radar to instrumented ranges that are useful for cued air surveillance applications and to produce another frequency band for meeting the challenge of short-range air surveillance. In particular, a high power amplifier operating in a propagation window bounded between 100 and 300 GHz (W-band is purposefully excluded to foster technology development at extremely high frequencies above 100 GHz) is needed for ranging applications reaching 20 km for a 1 square meter target. Initial models suggest that an amplifier with peak output powers of tens of Watts (50 W objective, 15 W threshold) is required assuming high gain antennas (60 dBi) are used. In order to promote multiple approaches, such transmitter may operate in continuous wave mode and/or pulsed mode with a minimum duty cycle of 5%. Associated waveform parameters (pulse width, instantaneous bandwidth, frequency tunability, pulse repetition frequency, harmonics, spurs, etc.) are to be defined by the proposer but should meet the requirements for Radar applications (e.g. an instantaneous bandwidth of 10% is desirable).",376,2441,1,No,No,No,,"Design a high power amplifier operating in an atmospheric transmission window between 100 &ndash; 300 GHz (e.g. 140 GHz, 220 GHz).

These simulation environments are used in sensor and seeker performance assessments, flight test analysis, and algorithm developments and are driven by high-fidelity target and threat radar scattering models which are validated against available referent signatures. MMW target signatures may be derived from a variety of physics based, signature prediction tools that utilize computer aided design (CAD) geometry models as inputs. CAD inputs are routinely modeled as pristine geometry sources as a philosophical choice to avoid exact fingerprinting of a single target instance in addition to real-world limitations such as a lack of input information, memory limits, or polygon budgets. That said, real-world target structures may exhibit a wide range of non-pristine geometric surfaces and unit-to-unit variability due to operational use, battle and test damage, manufacturing processes, and fabrication tolerances. For millimeter wave applications, geometry perturbations can produce significant deviations in radar scattering parameters to include dominant scattering amplitude, physical location of scattering, as well as the angular extent of scattering phenomenology as experienced for ground and air targets. While existing radar target models provide high fidelity inputs to scene generator applications, radar inputs to scene generation are generally not correlated to or functionally representative of underlying perturbations in target geometry and are handled on a discrete basis. In addition, a significant development resources are expended in MMW radar signature model creation and validation to discern and account for effects of non-pristine geometry elements that may be modeled by polygonal, spline, or parametric solid entities. Previous research has approached target variability through statistical variation of observed target signatures. While statistical variability methodologies present valuable approaches for modeling signature variation over a target class, the current desire is to research and address the correlation of geometric perturbations and radar signature modeling at the source CAD and scattering physics level. Techniques are required to analytically correlate and functionally represent target geometric perturbations in millimeter wave radar models for use in existing scene generation applications and simulation environments to include the Army's Common Scene Generator (CSG), CCDC AvMC hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) facilities, and CCDC AvMC Virtual Target Center (VTC) predictive models. This would allow modeling flexibility and ensure simulation environments are driven by millimeter wave models that capture and quantify the effect of geometry perturbations encountered with a target structure while reducing development duration and validation complexity. The modeling approach for this effort should be adaptable for integration to radar signal generation chains within existing simulations with emphasis on Ka-band scattering for both ground and air assets.

Active imaging systems all require the detection of reflected light, usually through an active source such as a laser, but depending on the intended application, different readouts are required. While the majority of the work in active imaging has been in the visible, near-infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and midwave infrared (MWIR), the U.S. Army has significant interest in developing these same active imaging capabilities in the LWIR in pursuit of operating and ranging in degraded visual environments (DVE). One significant difference in active imaging capability is the required gate times, where laser range finders require high-precision short gate times and the use of a voltage ramp or other timing device, while asynchronous laser pulse detection (ALPD) requires longer gates and need to be able to detect multiple pulses in a single gate. Additionally, current range finding technologies, when leveraged by the warfighter, have the limitation of ensuring that the target of interest is being ranged, and does not allow for verification of the target being ranged. This topic seeks to develop a digital read-out integrated circuit (DROIC) architecture that achieves laser range finding alongside the ability to do passive imaging to verify the target, while adding one other capability such as ALPD or multi-pulse detection. The ideal ROIC would support all forms of active imaging while enabling passive imaging in a single design. This kind of architecture will have applications to Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) as well as Future Vertical Lift (FVL) under the Army Modernization Priorities. The developed DROIC architecture should function with active imaging sensors with pixel pitches less than 30 &micro;m, with the goal of 12 &micro;m, and be scalable to HD arrays. The DROIC architecture should be able to be hybridized with an avalanche photodiode (APD) detector and have an overall low power consumption. For laser range finding, ranging resolution of 1m or less out to 5km are greatly preferred. The architecture must be able to eventually be integrated into an integrated dewar cooler assembly (IDCA). Target array size is 128x128; but 512x512 is preferred. Designs where all capabilities are achieved in a simultaneous, snap-shot format will be considered; but are not expected over designs that require switching modes between frames or sequential readout. The design must support triggering from an external source. Stacked (3-D) or tiled ROIC architectures will be considered but are not required.",416,2693,1,No,No,No,,"Investigate, research, and design a DROIC architecture to meet the above specifications.

Two-point correction is often used make offset and gain corrections to the image to lower the fixed pattern noise. However, factory correction is inadequate due to the drift of pixel response over time. Correction in the field is often cumbersome, impractical, and inadequate to accommodate changing scene conditions. The problem becomes worse when dealing with polarization because of the image processing involved in generating the polarization images. For example, microgrid sensors typically have four polarization filters, horizontal(H), vertical(V), and two filters at 45 degrees and 135 degrees. Calculating the Stokes vector involves adding, subtracting, and dividing. Calculating the Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) involves squaring square rooting, and dividing. Each of these operations increases the noise. The Army requires a correction for pixel drift and changing scenes using microgrid, microbolometer sensors operating from a moving platform such as a small UAV. The algorithm(s) should operate in near-real time at an imager's frame rate.",170,1175,1,No,No,No,,Phase I consists of the development or adaptation of an SBNUC process using image sequence or video data that has characteristics of imagery collected from a small UAS using a minimum number of images or scene changes.

Analysis shall include a comparison of mean and standard deviation of degree of linear polarization (DoLP) noise characteristics in addition to other image comparison algorithms or metrics. Shortcomings of the developed process should be described. The path to make the approach more robust under a greater variety of scene and platform motion conditions to be implemented in Phase II should be described. It is necessary to eliminate to the greatest extent possible any dependence on additional hardware or specific motions of the platform or a gimbal to achieve scene-based corrections. Trade- offs that may be necessary to achieve the SBNUC improvement shall be identified.,"Phase II consists of the implementation, testing, and optimization of the polarimetric SBNUC process on real data collected from a small UAS platform. Further, data shall be collected and the SBNUC shall be demonstrated under a variety of environmental, background, and time of day conditions.

The use of AM methods to produce expeditionary shelters will result in reduced logistics that potentially saves lives, money, and time, as well as an enhanced ability to produce mission essential infrastructure closer to the point-of-need. Successful development of the MASh Kit will provide a RWS solution that is adaptable, modular, and configurable to withstand the spectrum of potential operating environments (arctic, desert, jungle, mountain, etc.). Successful identification of composite materials that meet all of the requirements for expeditionary shelters as described above will benefit the larger AM community by advancing material research into feedstock recipes for use in any AM application.The capabilities developed through this effort are expected to significantly contribute to the field of additive manufacturing as unit deployment speed through the ability to manufacture locally on-site if necessary. This capability would enable units to support and complete the mission when the procurement system is not responsive, delayed, or compromised, thereby increasing readiness. Since AM uses digital files instead of physical tooling like patterns and molds, it is a highly flexible technology. Manufacturing costs can be determined by three metrics &ndash; material, operating, and labor expenses. Unlike wasteful reductive manufacturing techniques, AM is a process that uses just enough material to produce an object. As a single unattended process, operating and labor expenses are eliminated by freeing personnel for other tasks. Since AM does not require object-specific tooling, the end result is additional savings whenever implementing product changes or improvements. The MASh Kit has not yet been manufactured or tested at full scale, which is required to facilitate research and testing of optimal material feedstock, component connection designs, structural integrity, and printing setup. This testing is needed to ensure that the MASh Kit meets or exceeds Army requirements for expeditionary structures. The MASh Kit also requires comparative analysis against existing military shelter systems in terms of ease of use, production timelines, logistics, and end user point-of-need adaptability.The offeror will propose an AM system that would serve as a component of the Developmental and Operational Testing of the MASh Kit shelter and will be required to substantiate performance to determine if the system, as a whole, meets the Army's requirements and is capable of fielding a first unit within 24 months.",454,3135,1,No,No,No,,"The offeror will examine the feasibility and capability of the Science of AM to advance the design of the MASh Kit from a low TRL concept to a fieldable product, and to print parts and components for evaluation and further development to a fieldable product that is both producible and commercially viable to the military, humanitarian, and commercial markets. Additionally, the offeror will perform structural testing of the printed parts for comparison to traditionally manufactured components, perform development of near-continuous 3D printed linear parts using market-available materials, and evaluate emerging sustainable and recycled materials for use in the printed components. For improved sustainability, the offeror will explore design of traditional production hardware components and accessories that can be 3D printed and identify improvements where feasible, while meeting relevant military requirements. In addition to printing of hardware, the offeror will explore the use of traditional commercially available hardware for comparison of cost, sustainability, and availability. The wall panels to be deployed as part of the MASh Kit will be developed, and the potential of 3D printing walls or printing high R-value wall sections that will accept traditional commercially available insulation will be developed and evaluated. Driving a high R-value for MASh Kit will allow deployment in Arctic or extreme environments. Also, consideration will be given to development of insulating material that can be 3D printed and designed into the MASh Kit wall panel. Finally, the offeror will use the Phase I effort to identify potential additional uses and capability gaps that can improve or leverage Science of AM to advance the MASh Kit design in both garrison and deployed environments.","If the MASh Kit is adopted into the ASF-RWS program, ERDC-CERL will partner with U.S. Army Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PdM FSS), the program office responsible for managing ASF-RWS, and the offeror to resource any remaining evaluation required of the MASh Kit and development of the required Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) elements to support the product as it enters and proceeds through its Production & Deployment phase. ASF-RWS shelters are centrally procured and customer-funded by the requiring program office or military unit. So, in order to facilitate that procurement approach for MASh Kit, PdM FSS will coordinate the necessary contracting vehicle(s) and item management and logistics support for the product.","ERDC-CERL also strives to leverage the feasibility determination accomplished in Phase I with the Objectives of Phase II being: A) The offeror will complete design and manufacture up to twelve (12) full scale MASh Kits for demonstration/testing of shelter that is equivalent in size and function to a B-Hut (530 sq ft), capable of being transported and reassembled for field testing.B) The offeror will demonstrate the Science of AM capability to produce the MASh Kit system and any components required for its maintenance and repair. C) The offeror will demonstrate the ability for the MASh Kit to be manufactured in high volume using a combination of AM and traditional non-AM methods.D) The offeror will demonstrate the ability for AM-produced MASh Kit components to duplicate non-AM MASh Kit components as similar in physical characteristics such as strength, ruggedness, and application. E) The offeror will evaluate the feasibility of AM-produced MASh Kits components to include ballistic protection inherent in the AM process. F) The offeror will complete a Technology Readiness Assessment and provide a document detailing the artifacts and justification to satisfy TRL determination.G) The offeror will provide a model for configuring and packaging the above concepts into a deployable containerized system requiring only electric power and the raw materials for 3D printing of the MASh Kit. The AM capability studied will need to meet necessary size and weight criteria to enable packaging within the current footprint of standard international shipping containers.H) Additionally, the offeror will identify advantages and benefits of utilizing the MASh Kit, including but not limited to cost, technical, training, readiness, logistics, technology limitations, and weight.",1,"DoD Directive 4540.07, &ldquo;Operation of the DoD Engineering for Transportability and Deployability Program.&rdquo; October 30, 2019, as amended; Joint Committee on Tactical Shelters (JOCOTAS) 2017.&ldquo;DoD Standard Family of Tactical Shelters (Rigid/Soft/Hybrid).&rdquo; May 2012; updated May 2017.

Digital transformation will improve data access and machine learning to understand, visualize, and decide and direct faster. Information will flow rapidly between the enterprise and soldiers on the ground. Soldier worn power and data networks are necessary to bring these concepts to fruition. To date, success has been achieved in the development, test and evaluation of a variety of functional textile-based data networks for the dismounted Soldier. Examples of network protocols that have been successfully prototyped include USB 2.0, Gigabit Ethernet, serial, SMBus, and I2C. These demonstrations have shown that while etextiles can be used to form effective data networks, they behave differently than traditional theoretical models or empirical guidelines would indicate due to their unique composition and structure. Standard models used for designing strip lines and cables do not accurately predict the impedance characteristics of etextile materials. The connectors used for these networks, and the methods used to connect them to the etextile also have unique impedance characteristics. Line impedance is one of the main components of cable design and it's a driving factor when designing for high speed data. The higher the data rates, the tighter the tolerances become for all design parameters. Currently the process of designing etextile data networks relies on laboratory experimentation to achieve the desired performance which is time consuming and expensive. The development of new models and design tools are desired that accurately predict the impedance and other performance characteristics necessary to quickly build these networks. The development process will include the investigation of the composition and structure of etextile networks and related state-of-the-art materials to characterize and understand the impact of these components on impedance. In addition, the influence of dielectric and shielding materials, connectors, and connector interface media will also be evaluated and characterized. The resulting modeling and design tools are necessary to support early prototyping, testing, and touch points with Soldiers from the operational force to help ensure that solutions generated are the right ones. Ultimately these models will feed into advanced manufacturing methods and processes and will be incorporated into system design, development, production and sustainment.",370,2590,1,No,No,No,,"The Phase I awardee shall determine the technical feasibility to develop new design tools and guidelines, including but not limited to, a signal line impedance model to be based on a combination of first principles and empirical data.
