              In a world where established companies maintain advantages through relationships and resources, 
              we're working to democratize access to government contracting opportunities. We believe that 
              every company, regardless of size or connections, deserves a fair shot at government contracts.

          <h2>The Challenge: Access Barriers in Government Contracting</h2>
          <div className="problem-description">
            <div className="problem-text">
              <p>
                Government contracting has evolved into a system where established companies often maintain 
                advantages through long-standing relationships, extensive resources, and insider knowledge. 
                While these companies may deliver quality work, the system creates barriers that make it 
                difficult for innovative newcomers to compete on equal footing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, innovative small businesses, veteran-owned companies, women-owned businesses, and
                minority-owned enterprises often struggle to access the same opportunities. They're not 
                necessarily shut out due to lack of capability, but rather due to limited access to the 
                networks, intelligence, and tools that established players take for granted.

              <h3>We're Changing the Game</h3>
              <p>
                Prop Shop AI was founded on a simple principle: government contracts should go to the companies
                that can do the best work, not just the companies that know the right people. We're using cutting-edge
                technology to level the playing field and give underdogs the tools they need to compete with established players.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like Robin Hood sharing resources with those who need them most, we're making the advantages that 
                established companies have developed available to everyone. We're democratizing access to government 
                contracting intelligence, tools, and opportunities.

              <p>
                Established companies have teams of analysts and expensive market intelligence tools. We're making
                that same intelligence available to small businesses at a fraction of the cost.

                opportunities that established companies may not actively share.
