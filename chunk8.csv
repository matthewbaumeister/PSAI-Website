A: The GPS locations and their accuracy shall be within a circular halo of 5-cm in radius where its center is that of the target (if symmetrical) or no more than 5-cm away from any part of the threat (if non-symmetrical). A differential GPS-based system will be utilized.

Q8 (05/03/2021): Is the scope of this effort focused on the digitized threat location data and mapping with existing hand-held detectors, or does it include the development of the detection capability as well?
A: The Phase I (roughly 6 months) of this effort involves a development/evaluation of an algorithmic mine detection including AI attributes in order to improve and render the required detection effectiveness.

Q9 (04/28/2021): Can you provide details on the ""designated explosive breaching system""?
A: At this time we are unable to provide any details.

Q10 (04/14/2021): Is the focus of the study to develop new mine detection methods through the current mine detection handheld systems or is the study's goal to ingest and integrate data from the handheld devices, leverage AI/ML and advanced algorithms to help determine where additional threats might be on the minefield, visualize those threats on a map, and push that information to the breaching systems (""shooter"")?
A: This SBIR effort is focused on the handheld device as it has been proven to guarantee virtually (not to be overly optimistic) 100% detection and locating mines and IEDs, given that it is limited in time and funding. And&nbsp;consequently&nbsp;its results guarantee a trustworthy digital map which will be handed off to the secondary but not least neutralization system. In the future, once the unmanned, robotic platform could achieve similar capabilities, a small modification of this first&nbsp;cut digital map would be a rather small job.&nbsp;

Q11 (04/09/2021): Is there any interest in a solution which focuses only on the localization portion of the problem? Creating a networked hand held system which can localize in GPS denied environments and if integrated with a mine detection sensor in the future could provide the complete solution?
A: This SBIR effort is focused on the handheld device as it has been proven to guarantee virtually (not to be overly optimistic) 100% detection and locating mines and IEDs, given that it is limited in time and funding. And consequently its results guarantee a trustworthy digital map which will be handed off to the secondary but not least neutralization system.

Currently, fielded handheld mine and Improvised Explosive Device (IED) detectors do not have GPS or positioning sensors to record the location of detected threats. Additionally, current mine detection capabilities are limited, which do not allow engagement with specific mine threats. In this effort, data from the handheld detectors will be analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) or advanced algorithms to accurately identify surface laid and buried mines. The data will then also be used to populate a threat map that can be utilized by the advanced explosive breaching system for selective neutralization of targets. This will greatly reduce the amount of ammunition needed to clear a mine field versus creating an area effect across the entire minefield. The digitized threat map will also provide Soldiers with situational awareness of existing or neutralized explosive hazard threats on the battlefield.",170,1107,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will consist of investigation and evaluation of the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) with advanced mine detection algorithm software - the combination of which will undergo laboratory testing. Further hardware-in-the-loop testing and laboratory tests will be conducted to integrate the ""smart"" mine detection algorithm software with the explosive breaching system requirements. The results of Phase I will demonstrate the integration of the sensor with the explosive breacher. Successful laboratory tests and demonstration will conclude Phase I and specific requirements for Phase II will be identified.","Phase II will further develop the advanced AI/mine detection software demonstrated in Phase I in a relevant environment and demonstrate that the detectors can detect the threat. Phase II will also generate the digital threat map of an instigated minefield with accurate locations of the threats, mines, and IEDs. The digitized map will interface with the explosive breacher, which will receive and process the inputs from the threat map to eradicate all identified threats.","Success of Phase II will allow transition of the technology to fielded AN/PSS-14C Mine Detection Systems, NXGNHH, Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), and the Tactical Assault Kit (TAK).",1,"Researchers Advance Detection Method for Explosives, U.S. Army DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory Public Affairs, https://www.army.mil/article/242508/researchers_advance_detection_method_for_explosives; Computational Intelligence in Explosive Hazard Detection, Derek T.

The tool set will demonstrate capabilities of a theoretical Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna to detect stationary ground targets while using the STI waveforms.,"The Apache Attack Helicopter PMo would like to explore the potential benefits of a type of phased array antenna, specifically an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) for the detection of stationary ground targets. An AESA within the Mast Mounted Assembly (located above the rotor) would allow transmission of Stationary Target Indicator (STI) waveforms and beam articulation over a target area. STI waveforms and tools are needed to establish capabilities and limiting factors of a Fire Control Radar (FCR) with a theoretical AESA. Waveforms must address both Pulse Width (PW) and Pulse Repetition Frequencies (PRF) optimizations to accommodate interference caused by the rotary wing when engagement profiles force the beam to pass through the blades. Waveforms employing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMo) should be considered for generation of high resolution, low sidelobes and enhanced orthogonality. The tools will be employed to optimize the STI waveforms in the detection of targets within an area of 300 m cross-range (azimuth angular) by 150 m down-range in the following modes: 1. Real-Beam Imaging (RBI) and 2. Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR). The Apache will be positioned at theoretical altitudes, flight profiles and slant ranges detailed in the table below. Innovative techniques to distinguish unique target signatures such as variable dwell times (the time an antenna beam spends on a target) to improve detection in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), wide bandwidths for fine range resolution, multiple transmit and/or receive channels, Doppler beam sharpening, radar cross section (RCS) pattern matching and others can be used. The STI waveforms and tools will be used at a minimum to define target area coverage, detectable target size, AESA specifications, Flight Profiles (Altitude, Slant Range, Velocity, Attitude, Look Angle to Target), and Beam Time on Target requirements. The optimized STI waveforms and tools will support development of combat techniques to be used in stationary target engagements in both: 1. RBI and 2.

After the STI waveforms have been completed, development of supporting modeling and simulation (M&S) tools may be accomplished. The modeling tools can be existing in-house tools or based on commercially available products and will focus at a minimum on the system, battlefield environment and scenario parameters. The simulation tools can be existing in-house tools or based on commercially available products and will at a minimum apply parameters to the waveform under test at the following increments: Altitude 100 ft., Slant Range (Dismount 100 m, and Vehicle 100 m) with a focus on transmit frequency, polarization and bandwidth, number of antenna subarrays and platform movements. FCR radar data may or may not be supplied depending on availability, therefore data sources may be generated, or historical data may be used. The required Phase I deliverables will include a formal report documenting the analysis and designs accomplished, STI waveforms, and the proposed M&S tools.","The adapted M&S tools used in Phase I will be optimized into a standalone software tool set to support the enhancement of the prototype STI waveforms with emphasis on the STI in RBI and SAR modes. The tool set will exercise the STI waveforms with input signatures of stationary ground target within clutter using signal simulation, signature databases, or collected data depending on availability. Results will be documented, and adjustments made to the prototype waveforms as signal extractions are accomplished. This process will result in enhanced STI waveforms for the detection of stationary ground target in clutter while in RBI and SAR modes. The desired Phase II result is a demonstration to substantiate the operation and capabilities of the waveforms and tool set. The required Phase II deliverables will include a formal report, enhanced STI waveforms, and the optimized tool set. Classified proposals are not accepted under the DoD SBIR Program. In the event DoD Components identify topics that will involve classified work in Phase II, companies invited to submit a proposal must have or be able to obtain the proper facility and personnel clearances to perform Phase II work.","In Phase III the vendor will work with PM Apache and the prime contractors to integrate the STI waveforms into a prototype FCR employing an AESA. The goal is to mature the STI waveforms and tool set to develop real world combat flight profiles and system configurations, which will be used to perform in-flight demonstrations. It is envisioned that an approach of increasing complexity will be used. The initial step is to develop RBI and SAR flight profiles and radar configurations for simplistic target engagements to test the optimized STI waveforms. The next step will be to develop progressively more complex RBI and SAR flight profile and system configurations for more difficult target engagements to completely test the optimized STI waveforms. During each iteration compare flight test results to the results produced by to M&S tool set and evaluate the differences to determine if the waveforms or tool set require modification. Any changes to the STI waveforms or tool set would be documented and presented to the government. In the longer-term, the desire is to potentially integrate this technology onto current and/or future Army rotorcraft radars, such as Future Vertical Lift radars or the AH-64 Apache Fire Control Radar. The waveforms and accompanying tool set can be used in the digital evolution of target extraction techniques from high noise environments in military and civilian for applications (i.e. perimeter security, terrain mapping, advanced nonvisual point to point navigation in denied GPS environments and terrain avoidance). Also, the modeling and simulation tool set is not limited to RF-derived signal strings. Other commercial applications may include detection and processing of any sub-clutter signals as seen medical scanning, atmospheric anomaly, and industrial object detection.",1,"Onart and Arikan, ""Simulation of Real Beam Ground Mapping Mode of a Pulsed Radar,"" 2006 IEEE 14th Signal Processing and Communications Applications, Antalya, 2006, pp. 1-4.; L.

A: We have a HMI assessment on-going and we can define over the course of a Phase I/Phase II effort.&nbsp; We will have users available to assess the technology and Concepts of Operations that would facilitate faster intelligence capture.

Q9 (04/07/2021): Are the augmented overlays expected to be embedded in the FMV on the platform, or is it expected to generate them over the STANAG 4609 video as received at the ground station?
A: The AR overlays would be embedded on the FMV inside of the UGCS.&nbsp; We would offer up processing resources and access to the FMV on the UGCS to execute the algorithms to mark important points to facilitate intelligence gathering.

Q10 (04/06/2021): Will this capability need to be compatible with the current Gray Eagle Universal Ground Control Station?
A: Yes.&nbsp; The vendor can be supported in both Linux or Windows 10 Virtual Machines inside of the UGCS.",,"Information Systems, Sensors",2,Information Systems,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning,1,Augmented Reality; Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS); Motion Imagery; Full Motion Video; Vision Based Navigation; Geographic Information System Mapping; Ground Control Station; Intelligence; Surveillance; and Reconnaissance (ISR),10,Augmented Reality,No,0,No,,"Develop a capability to help the MQ-1C Gray Eagle (a medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft system) Payload operators improve situational awareness (SA) and increase intelligence gathering efficiency to ultimately reduce workload.

The capture of intelligence products is labor intensive for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle Payload operator. During the typical ISR mission, the Gray Eagle Payload operator is often task saturated while also conducting radio communication with ground units. A seamless capability that would allow for quick tagging of Points of Interest, overlay of key geographical features (roads, buildings of interest), and integration of targeting / Field of View algorithms would reduce the amount of workload required of the operator. Other desired capabilities are quick intelligence capture by automatic creation of a quad chart that would detail graphical details, technical details (how many, how much, Pattern-of-Life), and other relevant details.Useful information quickly accessible on the FMV would be an overlay road names, past events of military interest, high granularity coordinates, enemy or friendly locations, and past observation reports.

Q6 (04/21/2021): Would there be interest in a anti-bacterial/microbial protective coating on the existing physical cards ? We currently have a coating that lasts up to 90 days but in development of a 9-12 month self-healing protective coating with protection against Covid-19.
A: The Gov&rsquo;t defers this approach to the offerors, and takes no position with this specific question.

Q7 (04/14/2021): 1) The solicitation states "" To the extent possible, the approach should comply with open standards and leverage existing infrastructure to include sensors currently employed for entry operations.""
What are these specific ""open standards"" being referenced?
What specific systems are included in these ""sensors currently employed for entry operations?""
2) The solicitation states ""It is permissible to leverage other electronic systems commonly carried by military and governmental personnel. However, such leverage should not affect standard entry during degraded operations (i.e. failure of electrical system, cellular network, etc.)."" 
Is this to be interpreted to mean that the proposed system should function effectively even during a complete loss of electrical power?
A: 1. Product Manager Force Protection Systems supports all industry open-standards, and open standards supported by the wider DoD and NATO.&nbsp; The intent is to move away from proprietary commercial standards, so that more industry partners can participate as technologies need to be refreshed.&nbsp; With more participation from industry, the Gov&rsquo;t hopes technical re-fresh and other sustainment costs are driven down by the competition. For sensors employed for entry operations, Product Manager Force Protection Systems would like industry to focus on affordable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors like:&nbsp; Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) electro-optic video cameras, infrared video cameras, night-time color cameras, RADAR systems, Cell Phone detectors, CAC readers, gun-shot audible detectors &ndash; and the underlying processing software that makes sense of what the sensors detect.&nbsp; The sensors are not all the sensors that could be used for entry control, but this should give industry a sense of the types of sensors used.

2.&nbsp;Gov&rsquo;t defers this approach to the offerors, and takes no position with this specific question.&nbsp; Industry is invited to be creative about the challenges of small camps and bases in the field.&nbsp; Likewise, industry may consider the amenities that large installations may experience.

Q8 (04/12/2021): Can it (should it) be assumed that a person seeking access be required to present a CONTACTLESS  credential ( or token) EG contactless PIV , CAC, or other NFC capable device to initiate a biometric verification of iris and or face ?
A: The Gov&rsquo;t defers these approaches to the offerors, and takes no position with this specific question.

Q9 (04/12/2021): The requirement infers a biometric identifier to be used at scale. Can you indicate the Scale of ""N"" ( EG1:N ) where N is the total population at a base for identification.
A: N, the total population at the base, can be range from 50 to 15,000 people. Product Manager Force Protection Systems field systems to both small and large installations &ndash; both CONUS and OCONUS.

Q10 (04/02/2021): Is wearable or mobile credentialing based solutions acceptable under this topic? Or specifically, are you looking for solutions that enhance the performance of biometric systems?

Q8 (04/30/2021): According to the announcement, âThe system would be used 24/7, day and night, and in a variety of weather conditionsâ and âConduct testing of an autonomous system to prove feasibility over extended operating conditionsâ.  Can you define what is meant by extended operating conditions, and how you intend to test to determine suitability?
A: While the overall objective is to integrate the solution into the existing AIE architecture, Phase II states the vendor will demonstrate a prototype system in a realistic environment. Conduct testing of an autonomous system to prove feasibility over extended operating conditions. The Government will provide access to a designated vehicle lane for setup, testing, and demonstration.&nbsp; Therefore, the Government anticipates vendors to provide a fully functioning facial recognition system with the ability to register onsite personnel for use during the test.&nbsp; These installation personnel will use the facial recognition test lane for verification of system performance.&nbsp; No AIE gate arm or traffic light will be used.&nbsp; Full integration will be dependent upon contract action and vendor interface development not addressed in Phase II.

Q9 (04/15/2021): Is there a TPOC assigned to this solicitation that interested parties can correspond with directly?
A: All questions must be submitted through DSIP now that open submission has begun.

Q10 (04/14/2021): 1) The solicitation states that the proposed solution must be ""integrated with the pre-existing Automated Installation Entry (AIE) system.""
What specifically does this integration imply? Physical integration with the existing hardware or infrastructure? A direct physical connection with existing computer systems? Software integration into an existing entry control software solution? Or all of the above?
2) The expected solution is expected to have ""Platform agnostic capability supports 3rd party systems or access control systems."" Are examples of these ""3rd party systems or access control systems"" available? Is the proposing company expected to have instances of these systems for use during development? And what form is this ""support"" intended to take?
3) Is the system expected to have features for detecting or overcoming intentional security bypass measures like facial spoofing or obfuscation?
4) The solution is intended to use ""existing technologies."" Does this imply that proposals that include novel or currently-in-development facial recognition algorithms will be considered non-responsive?
A: 1. While the overall objective is to integrate the solution into the existing AIE architecture, Phase II states the vendor will demonstrate a prototype system in a realistic environment. Conduct testing of an autonomous system to prove feasibility over extended operating conditions. The Government will provide access to a designated vehicle lane for setup, testing, and demonstration.&nbsp; Therefore, the Government anticipates vendors to provide a fully functioning facial recognition system with the ability to register onsite personnel for use during the test.&nbsp; These installation personnel will use the facial recognition test lane for verification of system performance.&nbsp; No AIE gate arm or traffic light will be used.&nbsp; Full integration will be dependent upon contract action and vendor interface development not addressed in Phase II.

2. AIE solutions continuously vet all personnel entering at ACP and share the installation-specific access control decisions with other installations using the DoD-mandated technical components (i.e., IMESA, Continuous Information Management Engine, and Interoperability Layer Service). The facial recognition solution is a single subsystem of the AIE system.&nbsp; It is not required to independently interface with 3rd party systems but adhere to industry and DoD standards allowing AIE to meet its mission.

3. &nbsp;The use of facial recognition at vehicle lanes presents many challenges such as environmental factors and obstructions to the driver&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Vendor responses are expected to address these challenges and their solution&rsquo;s ability to overcome them.

4. No.&nbsp; Facial recognition technology must continue to evolve to meet the tactics and techniques of our adversaries.&nbsp; The analysis supporting the need for a new algorithm, test activity, and completion timelines should be key elements in the submission.

Q11 (04/13/2021): Can you please provide clarification on the following requirement: Size: <= 143mm x 36mm. 

This seems kind of small for an outdoor rated camera system. Does this size requirement refer to the lens, the full enclosure, or something else?
A: <font face=""Calibri"">The camera size is only limited by its placement at the vehicle lane to not obstruct the guard&rsquo;s view of oncoming traffic or create a safety hazard for drivers.</font>

Q12 (04/13/2021): For phase II, what network infrastructure will be available, if any, in addition to the 110v power?

Thanks
A: <font face=""Calibri"">The Government would have to have the software cleared to run on a DoD network, but Phase 1 should focus on the what and the how in the final report. Phase II and Phase III is where the actual Technical work would be done.</font>

Q2 (05/03/2021): In this SBIR, is the term ârankâ used for the ranking of biometric quality for multiple biometric records of the same modality for the same subject? Or is ârankâ used to numerically order the probability of yellow candidate being a match to a probe?
A: <font face=""Tahoma"">I believe this is referring to &ldquo;ranking&rdquo;. We would like a ranking on the quality of the biometrics (think NFIQ scores for fingerprint) per image, we can then look at poorer quality images submitted by a device or user and take action (training, or remove device to upgrade sensor). They yellow candidate is calculated by the matcher, and would not have to be calculated in the SBIR (every vendor would have different yellow rates depending on the matcher and threshold rates).&nbsp; </font>

Q3 (05/03/2021): Under data cleansing techniques, is the purpose of âMissing image analysisâ to determine whether the biometric record contains the image specified for the biometric record (or is it missing)? If not, then for what purpose?
A: <font face=""Tahoma"">We have submission into DoD ABIS that are missing biometrics completely, those records should be flagged and then looked at for deletion. Some transactions could be valid, but have some modality missing, like a face transaction that has no fingerprints or iris. </font>

Q4 (05/03/2021): Under data cleansing techniques, is the purpose of âimage to field type associationâ to determine whether the image represents the biometric specified in the EBTS type? If not, then for what purpose?
A: <font face=""Tahoma"">Yes, we want to make sure that a face is in the Type 10, Fingerprint in Type 14, and so on&hellip;</font>

Q5 (05/03/2021): Under data cleansing techniques, is the purpose of âimage Identificationâ to evaluate an image and determine the type of biometric (e.g., face, iris, finger) or to segment the image data of interest (e.g., a face from a face in the wild image), or both.  If neither, then for what purpose?
A: <font face=""Tahoma"">Image identification could mean what type of biometric image is present (i.e. a fingerprint image is a fingerprint image), but could also identify non biometric image being submitted (example: a cat photo where a human face is expected).</font>

Q6 (05/03/2021): I wanted to verify if each element listed below is required for this Army SBIR Submission?      

Beginning with the DoD 21.1 SBIR BAA, all proposers are required to submit Volume 4: Company Commercialization Report (CCR), Volume 5(a): Contractor Certification Regarding Provision of Prohibited Video Surveillance and Telecommunications Services and Equipment, Volume 5(b): Foreign Ownership or Control Disclosure (Proposers must review Attachment 2: Foreign Ownership or Control Disclosure to determine applicability),and Volume 6: Fraud, Waste and Abuse training.
A: Proposers are required to submit&nbsp;Volume 4: Company Commercialization Report (CCR), Volume 5(a): Contractor Certification Regarding Provision of Prohibited Video Surveillance and Telecommunications Services and Equipment, Volume 5(b): Foreign Ownership or Control Disclosure (Proposers must review Attachment 2: Foreign Ownership or Control Disclosure to determine applicability),and Volume 6: Fraud, Waste and Abuse training.

Q7 (05/03/2021): We would like to include citations for resources supporting our Volume 2 response. Would you prefer to see those as footnotes in Volume 2, or could we use Volume 5 for these references?
A: While this is your proposal and you can ultimately decide how it is laid out, typically citations are referenced in the same document (footnotes) in which it is cited.

Q8 (05/02/2021): a) We are trying to figure out the number of pages and the required content of the technical volume. The main solicitation says ""The content of the Technical Volume will be specified in the ASO.""  Is there a separate ASO? can you provide us the link? 
b) for the number of pages, main solicitation  BAA 21.4  states ""Length: The length of the technical volume will be specified by the corresponding ASO"" but we are not able to find the ASO.
A: Please find the link here:&nbsp;https://beta.sam.gov/opp/0c1bb29f4f084e9e9030196690020ac4/view. The Technical Volume should not exceed 5 pages. Phase I commercialization strategy shall not exceed 2 pages. This should be the last section of the Technical Volume and will not count against the 5-page limit.

Q9 (05/01/2021): Greetings. Is there a template for Technical Volume that needs to be followed. Also What is the page limit for the Technical Volume?
A: Please refer back to the overarching 21.4 BAA (see Appendix A) for what needs to be included in the technical volume. We do not have a template at this time but Appendix A has thorough instructions as to what needs to be included. Phase I commercialization strategy shall not exceed 2 pages. This should be the last section of the Technical Volume and will not count against the 5-page limit.

Q10 (04/27/2021): Could you elaborate on the difference or association of ABIS and BEC?  For the purpose of this SBIR, what aspect of BEC is important to know about (for example, will ABIS be replaced with a new system in the next 12-24 months)?
A: The difference between DoD ABIS and BEC is that the DoD ABIS systems is the current Authoritative Repository for Biometrics in DoD, BEC is the follow on modernization effort that will take DoD ABIS into the Cloud and have more of a micro service architecture and will be called Biometrics Enabling Capability (BEC) 1. BEC1 will inherit a lot of the requirements of the existing ABIS system, but will focus on modernization of capabilities like moving from SMTP and SFTP to web services, bare metal to cloud, and higher availability that does not require the system to be taken off line for monthly maintenance releases.

Q11 (04/27/2021): As part of ABIS cleansing of the current data records (~18M), what is the anticipated volume of ongoing, biometric records - new records, being added to ABIS  each day/week/month?
A: New multimodal records Daily Average last month 9,165, Month 293,536, and yearly 3,540,000

Q12 (04/27/2021): Will the contractor have access to any ABIS data during Phase 1  and Phase 2?  If so, to what level (i.e., test set of representative modalities)?
A: We can provide training data sets around 50,000 &ndash; 100,000 if required. I will need to know to go through the process of requesting the data, so the earlier the better because it takes a few weeks.

Q13 (04/27/2021): What are the typical file formats for modality data found within ABIS?
A: <font face=""Tahoma"">File Format for the entire message is .eft, but biometric images are supposed to be JPG as defined in the ANSI/NIST Standard. Contextual information is just plain text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

Q14 (04/27/2021): Can the Army please provide additional details on the primary types of issues seen in the âyellowâ matches that require human examiners? For example is it a certain types of image quality, distortions, or skewed/rotated images?
A: <font face=""Tahoma"">I&rsquo;m assuming that you are talking about Yellow Resolve it looks like there was a formatting issues. Yellow resolves happen when the biometric matchers cannot make a statistical match/no match result. This can happen for many reasons, but the most common is poor image quality in the submission, which can cover off angle face, poor resolution, improper (non-standard) image size, over rotation of fingerprint images, and segmentation errors for fingerprints.</font>

Q15 (04/27/2021): Does the Army have a preferred modality to focus on (priority of modalities) for Phase I and II focus?
A: Yes, fingerprint is the most important, followed by face, then iris and palm data ( we have very little palm data). Fingerprint deduplication is important but so is segmentation errors and over rotation because those errors makes affect templating and matcher performance.

Q16 (04/27/2021): Our research shows there are 18M records in ABIS. Can you please provide a breakdown of those records (% or #s) across each of the modalities of biometrics, e.g., face, iris, palm ?
A: <font face=""Tahoma"">I don&rsquo;t have the modalities broken down for the entire database &nbsp;but here is a typical months biometric image counts : Face 102,158, Fingerprint 1,949,112 (1 image for each finger, plus 2 slaps), Iris 89,404, and Palm 223</font>",,Information Systems,1,Information Systems,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning,1,Biometrics; modality; face; finger; iris; palm; latent images; authoritative biometric data base,8,Biometrics,No,0,No,,"Resolve biometric data issues in the current authoritative biometrics database, the Department of Defense's Automated Biometric Identification System (DoD ABIS), through the development of a machine learning software application to identify errors and improve data quality, increasing speed and accuracy of responses to match requests.",45,"Resolve biometric data issues in the current authoritative biometrics database, the Department of Defense's Automated Biometric Identification System (DoD ABIS), through the development of a machine learning software application to identify errors and improve data quality, increasing speed and accuracy of responses to match requests.","For the purposes of this SBIR topic, biometrics refers to face, finger, iris, palm, latent images resident in the authoritative biometric data base systems. Cleansing refers to the deduplication of identity records, image (image = all/each modality) identification, image to field type association, image rotation analysis, image quality analysis, image spoofing, missing image analysis, and highest quality identification (per biometric).DoD ABIS, the authoritative data base, is required to accept all encounter submissions from across the DoD for inclusion within the biometric data set. Much of this input is from old and nearing obsolescence, legacy collection systems that do not limit inputs that are incorrect or limit in any meaningful way based on image capture quality. For this reason, the authoritative data base includes a large number of biometric records with errors, missing data, or low-quality images. This poor quality data uses valuable computing resources as well as results in a higher number of ""yellow"" matches which require a human examiner to review the request as well as to manually determine if there is or is not a match in the biometric data within the data base and the request.This issue will remain unresolved until all the legacy collection systems are displaced from the force. For that reason, a long term (3-5 year time horizon) solution is required to first, cleanse the data, and second, to continue to assess all incoming data, in order to rank and associate a data quality score for all images in the data base. As the old systems are removed from use in the field, data quality through the enforcement of collection quality thresholds which can be set on current COTS/GOTS (commercial/government off-the-shelf) collection systems.This will greatly improve system matching results and reduce the number and type of requests that require manual examination by the operations division examination team. This will in return also reduce the examination team's backlog and greatly increase their ability to respond to the smaller number of inquiries that will require manual adjudication by the human examiner.",335,2148,1,No,No,No,,"The objective of this Phase is to design a concept for a set of machine learning tools to rate, rank and associate a data quality score for all images in the data base.

Until the authoritative data base is cleansed of incomplete, incorrect and poor-quality data, human examiners will be required to adjudicate match requests that would otherwise be addressed through the transaction manager and current matching algorithms.

Q2 (05/02/2021): ""Phase I proposals shall not exceed 5 pages. Phase I commercialization strategy shall not exceed 2 pages. "" - We were unable to find the font size,  suggest format of the 5-page technical section and 2-page commercialization section in the BAA. Will you please provide us the URL of the same?
A: Font size should not be<b> </b>smaller than 10-point on standard 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; paper with one-inch margins.

Q3 (04/23/2021): 1.	Are there specific use cases that we should consider for Phase I? What kinds of locations should we focus on (e.g., CONUS/OCONUS, FOB)? Are there specific types of threats (e.g., aerial, ground vehicle, person) that we should focus on in Phase I? 
2.	What types of tracking scenarios and durations are envisioned? E.g., vehicle travelling in and out of ground cover, vehicle travelling through a moderately busy urban environment, a person revisiting a location a week later, person working their way through a crowd? 
3.	Is sensor/platform tasking to improve data collection of interest under this topic, or is the focus primarily on track fusion/re-acquisition? 
4.	What sensing modalities should be considered/prioritized? E.g., EO/IR, HSI, Radar, Seismic, Acoustic? 
5.	What is the typical target resolution (pixels-on-target) under the expected CONOPs? 
6.	Is this capability intended to plug into an existing multi-sensor object detection & tracking architecture, e.g. by providing a track fusion service, or should we plan to provide our own target detection/tracking? 
7.	Is detection of purposely camouflaged objects a requirement? 
8.	Will data be provided under Phase I and/or Phase II? 
9.	Are there any space, weight, power (SWaP) constraints we should consider?
A: &nbsp;Person re-identification (and matching to previously known tracks for that object) is a challenge with current systems. The PM FPS is responsible for both small bases that are forward deployed to force protection duties at large installations.&nbsp; Industry is invited to consider novel approaches, like employing UAS &ndash; and others. The Gov&rsquo;t defers this approach to the offerers.

Industry is invited to be creative and novel in its response.&nbsp; One particular challenge that industry may want to consider is the hand-off in tracking the object of interest between modalities as objects approach, depart, and move around a base and/or installation.&nbsp; Note: The underlying software that is making sense of the environment should account for objects below ground, on the terrain (at ground level), and in the air (under 5000 feet, above ground level).

industry is invited to be creative and novel

One particular challenge that industry may want to consider is the hand-off in tracking the object of interest between modalities as objects approach, depart, and move around a base and/or installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Classified data will not be provided. PM FPS is primarily interested in seeing if Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can coordinate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors applied to coordinated force protection and base defense applications.

Q4 (04/20/2021): What assumptions can be made regarding the current baseline of sensor systems and analytic products?
A: PM FPS will be able to provide architectures of current systems to awardees.

Q5 (04/20/2021): 1.	The solicitation mentions both multiple imaging sensors and, under the Phase II, multiple sensor modalities. Should the sensor modalities statement be interpreted as LiDAR, various cameras (MWIR, RGB-Vis, NIR), radar, etc? Or does variation in sensor modality refer specifically to location (Aerial, ground, tower, etc.)?

2.	What is the concept of operations for the desired technology?
A: Industry is invited to be creative and novel.&nbsp; The expected min/max ranges associated with the data is not known; however, industry is invited to be creative an novel in its response.&nbsp; One particular challenge that industry may want to consider is the hand-off in tracking the object of interest between modalities as objects approach, depart, and move around a base and/or installation.&nbsp; Note: The underlying software that is making sense of the environment should account for objects below ground, on the terrain (at ground level), and in the air (under 5000 feet, above ground level).

Q6 (04/16/2021): Section A.3 Phase I Proposal Instructions of the BAA states, ""Proposers are required to use the Phase I â Volume 3: Cost Proposal Template (Excel Spreadsheet) provided on the DSIP submission site."" I do not see an Excel file available for download. It appears we only need to complete Volume 3 within the submission site.
A: Correct; apologies for the confusion. The Cost Volume will appear directly on DSIP once you begin your submission.

Q7 (04/14/2021): 1. Will this project be classified in Phase II?
A: No. PM FPS is primarily interested in seeing if Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can coordinate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors applied to coordinated force protection and base defense applications.

Q8 (04/13/2021): 1.    The topic calls for the following âConduct a study on current use of analytics and type of sensors used in current systems deployed by FPS;â  Will small businesses selected:
  a.    Be provided access to information on the types of sensors deployed in current systems and to the analytics used in existing FPS deployed systems?
  b.    Be able to interview professionals who install/operate the existing FPS deployed system?


2.    During Phase I is the Army only interested in conducting a desk study on current use of analytics and sensors in current systems, or will the Army give any extra weightage to proposals that aim for early prototype development to demonstrate key principles and capabilities of fusing data from different sensors and modalities?


3.    The topic calls for âcorrelate object detections and tracks from multiple imaging sensors including but not limited to ground, aerial, and overhead imagery and videoâ.  For the purposes of writing this proposal, what assumptions should be made regarding existing capabilities?
  a.    Sensors that are already in use by FPS, i.e. in addition to video cameras
  b.    Technical specifications of these sensors including number of sensors, their resolution, digital/analog operations, number of pixels, bandwidth requirements for connectivity, etc.
  c.    Minimum, maximum, and average spatial diversity of the sensors
  d.    If any sensors have embedded tracking mechanisms
  e.    If any sensors can receive and respond to requests for additional data to improve tracking
  f.    Information available on communications lag between sensor and tracking monitors
  g.    Maximum speed of targets


4.    What is the page limit for the proposal?  Apologies for raising this question, but we were unable to find the response in the published solicitation.
A: Phase I proposals shall not exceed 5 pages. Phase I commercialization strategy shall not exceed 2 pages. This should be the last section of the Technical Volume and will not count against the 5-page limit. Please refer to Appendix A of the BAA 21.4 for detailed instructions on Phase I proposal preparation. You will also need a cover page (not included in 5 page limit). The Cost Template is also not included in this 5 page limit and will appear once you begin your submission in DSIP.

Q9 (04/13/2021): Will any autonomous vehicle testing be required / preferred for Phase I? If so, will it be possible to provide perspective vendors with a UAV/UAS waiver?
A: Gov&rsquo;t defers this approach to the offerors, and takes no position with this specific question.&nbsp; However, industry is invited to consider emerging technologies, like semi-to-fully autonomous vehicles as part of the perimeter security and base defense solution.

Q10 (04/13/2021): What sensor modalities are expected to be included (e.g. SAR, EO/IR, LIDAR, etc.)? What are the expected min/max ranges associated with the data?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The sensor modalities listed in the question are appropriate.&nbsp; However, industry is invited to be creative and novel.&nbsp; The expected min/max ranges associated with the data is not known; however, industry is invited to be creative an novel in its response.&nbsp; One particular challenge that industry may want to consider is the hand-off in tracking the object of interest between modalities as objects approach, depart, and move around a base and/or installation.&nbsp; Note: The underlying software that is making sense of the environment should account for objects below ground, on the terrain (at ground level), and in the air (under 5000 feet, above ground level).

Q11 (04/08/2021): Should Phase I research address presentation of the sensor data or analytical products to the user?
A: We would prefer the latter.

Q12 (04/07/2021): Is Direct to Phase II an option for this topic?
A: No, this is a Phase I topic.

Q13 (04/07/2021): How many companies are expected to be chosen for Phase I for this topic?

The attachments do not appear on the BAA listing for Beta Sam and the ""Template"" shown on DSIP appears to be no more than screen shots for the site itself, not a tech volume template.  Can the government please clarify/ correct the location of these templates?
A: Please refer back to the overarching 21.4 BAA (see Appendix A) for what needs to be included in the technical volume. We do not have a template at this time but Appendix A has thorough instructions as to what needs to be included. The Cost Proposal should be available directly through the DSIP portal once you begin your submission.

Q15 (04/23/2021): I was hoping that you can help provide clarification on the expectations of this topic around the capabilities. Understanding the C5ISR focus, I am interpreting this in a few ways. Is the intent a virtualized network environment for network operators to perform in, or more an entire virtual battlefield with network, cyber warfare, and electronic warfare concepts built into it? Any details on the envisioned end state would help.

2. Currently you only have a ""dot"" simulation capability for IR.  Is the A214-026 topic looking to add distributed IR target signatures?

3. Are you looking to add IR dot signatures in specific IR bands? 

4. What are the surface characteristics of the projection dome?  Is the surface intended to provide diffuse or mirror-like reflections? 

5. Does MTS desire the ability to dynamically change simulator/stimulator output power to simulate threats flying toward/away from the system under test?

6. What frequency ranges and instantaneous bandwidths are required for the radar simulation capability?

7. Is there a requirement to simulate multiple threats from multiple angles simultaneously?
A: 1.&nbsp;The image generated by the 14 projectors is presented on the interior surface of the dome.

2.&nbsp;Ideally, yes.

3.&nbsp;No.&nbsp; The interest is in producing IR signatures for real targets (i.e. vehicles, aircrafts, persons, etc.) such that a system with an IR sensor(s) and aided targeting capabilities would identify as the real thing.

4. It is understood that the current MTS projection screen has its limitations as the material was not designed to be used as a projection surface.&nbsp; The air inflated dome, which doubles as the visual and IR projection surface, is made of Teflon Coated Kevlar and is typically used in radome applications.&nbsp; The broadband reflectivity characteristics of the interior surface are provided below.&nbsp; Alternatives to using the projection screen are welcomed.&nbsp; Additionally, alternative screen technology that would enable better visual and IR projection is also of interest.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Q6 (04/22/2021): Hello,
I am interested in the SBIR topic A214-026 TITLE: Threat/Target Sensor Simulation Technology. I have the following questions I am wondering if you could provide information:
 
1.	Does the topic intend to use MTS dome as the projection screen, or the simulated scene is directly projected to the sensor under test?if the dome is used as a projection screen for IR images - could they provide its reflection spectra - visible and IR? 
2.	For the Infrared simulation, what are the detailed requirements such as pixels resolution,  wavelength range, field of view, frame rate, dynamic range, apparent temperature? 
3.	For the radar simulation, what are the detailed requirements such as target angle, delay, range extent, Doppler, amplitude, glint, polarization?
A: 1. Ideally, yes, but it is understood that the current MTS projection screen has its limitations as the material was not designed to be used as a projection surface.&nbsp; The air inflated dome, which doubles as the visual and IR projection surface, is made of Teflon Coated Kevlar and is typically used in radome applications.&nbsp; The broadband reflectivity characteristics of the interior surface are provided below.&nbsp; Alternatives to using the projection screen are welcomed.&nbsp; Additionally, alternative screen technology that would enable better visual and IR projection is also of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

2.

Q7 (04/22/2021): Hello,
I am interested in the SBIR topic A214-026 TITLE: Threat/Target Sensor Simulation Technology. I have the following questions I am wondering if you could provide information:
 
1.	Does the topic intend to use MTS dome as the projection screen, or the simulated scene is directly projected to the sensor under test?if the dome is used as a projection screen for IR images - could they provide its reflection spectra - visible and IR? 
2.	For the Infrared simulation, what are the detailed requirements such as pixels resolution,  wavelength range, field of view, frame rate, dynamic range, apparent temperature? 
3.	For the radar simulation, what are the detailed requirements such as target angle, delay, range extent, Doppler, amplitude, glint, polarization?
A: 1. Ideally, yes, but it is understood that the current MTS projection screen has its limitations as the material was not designed to be used as a projection surface.&nbsp; The air inflated dome, which doubles as the visual and IR projection surface, is made of Teflon Coated Kevlar and is typically used in radome applications.&nbsp; The broadband reflectivity characteristics of the interior surface are provided below.&nbsp; Alternatives to using the projection screen are welcomed.&nbsp; Additionally, alternative screen technology that would enable better visual and IR projection is also of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Q8 (04/22/2021): How much of a hardware component is expected for the proposed solution?
A: Hardware to generate the threat and target signatures (radar, IR) will be an important part of the solution.&nbsp; Hardware that can be controlled by software to modify the threat signature based on motion, location, and obstacles will provide the ultimate solution.

Q9 (04/22/2021): Is the 'Feasibility Documentation' required for Volume 2 of this proposal and if so what is the page length maximum?

Q12 (04/19/2021): 1) Will the government accept a partial solution?
2) What types of features are the government interested in having created?
A: Yes, an IR only based solution or radar only based solution are acceptable.&nbsp; It is understood that each of these technologies presents different and unique challenges and that getting both in the same solution may not be practical.&nbsp; More importantly is that a proposed solution can be integrated into the overall simulation.

2) What is the minimum desired number of Hartmann Shack sub-apertures / lenslets (e.g., 32x32, 73x45, etc.)?

3) What is the minimum desired HS framerate in Hz?

4) Does the government already have a specific Hartmann Shack sensor hardware configuration in mind for this project?

5) Does the government already have a specific beacon emitter in mind for this project?
A: 1. While the proposed solution does not need to be tied to a specific Hartmann turbulence sensor design, it should be a Shack Hartmann based turbulence sensoras described in the topic.

2. There is no specific requirement on the number of sub-apertures. This should be tied to the requirement to be able to accurately measure Cn2 to an ascending beacon.&nbsp; Although no requirement is given for the beacon ascent rate , it is reasonable to assume it to be greater than or equal to 1 m/sec. The number of independent measurements achieved per second will be a function of the number of sub apertures and the camera frame rate.&nbsp; This is an important aspect of the trades that need to be performed under this SBIR.

3. Ascent rates on the order of or greater than 1 m/sec are desired, without any pauses.

4. Although the SBIR is not specifically tied to it, the government does have an HTS system and will be interested in applying the results from this SBIRto that system.&nbsp;

5. Although it is not a specific requirement, it is expected that a high brightness visible wavelength LED beacon will be used.

The goal of this SBIR grant is to develop a system including a beacon, turbulence sensor and data collection methodology to collect and process dynamic optical turbulence data from the sensor to measure the turbulence with consideration to the rate of movement of the beacon platform.","As modern laser weapon systems are becoming more prevalent, measuring atmospheric turbulence for predicting the laser system effectiveness will be of great concern. Of particular interest is the variation in atmospheric turbulence as a function of height above ground. Among the most proliferated and trusted atmospheric turbulence measurements, is the Hartmann Turbulence Sensor (HTS). This sensor requires an optical source (beacon) to be placed at some distance from the sensor head and for an integrated turbulence measurement to be performed along the path. Consequentially, turbulence measurements with HTS have been restricted to static, near ground paths only. There are numerous challenges to overcome to obtain turbulence measurements as a function of height, which can be achieved by elevating the beacon on a platform (e.g. Unmanned Aircraft System). Some challenges include existing hardware constraints in both the turbulence sensors and beacons. Turbulence sensors typically have very narrow fields of view which requires very accurate pointing. Similarly, beacons are typically limited in beam width to less than 10 degrees and must be accurately and actively pointed at the sensor on the ground to prevent loss of signal. This SBIR grant shall include research on how to implement the entire data collection system and data processing required to accurately reconstruct the vertical Cn2 profile.The proposal for this effort shall include details on how to construct the data collection hardware including mounting a beacon a platform (e.g. UAS) with pointing ability, identifying a turbulence sensor to be used (e.g. Shack Hartmann Wavefront Sensor), and tracking capability for the turbulence sensor. The proposal shall address the necessary data collection rates of the turbulence sensor to measure the turbulence with consideration to the rate of movement of the beacon platform. There are two different data processing functions that should be researched and developed in order to provide the complete solution that is required of this program. The first is the conversion of raw Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) data to atmospheric turbulence parameters such as the Fried coherence length (r0) and the refractive index structure function, Cn2. The second function is the reconstruction of the vertical turbulence profile using the full data set captured over a complete beacon ascent. The SHWFS data processing should consider the following established methods as a minimum; differential image motion (DIMM), difference of differential tilt variance (DDTV), and differential scintillation. Other methods as well as new innovations in this area are encouraged but their performance in comparison to the above listed methods should be well documented. The vertical profile reconstruction problem should consider iterative stepwise solutions as well as more optimized simultaneously solved system solutions in order to overcome the noise amplification problems that are expected with the iterative solutions.",448,3034,1,No,No,No,,"The Phase 1 effort will use wave optics generated (simulated) HTS data to establish the minimum requirements for the HTS and to develop the processing algorithms. The outcome of this work will be to develop, demonstrate, and deliver the processing algorithms that can optimally process the HTS data and reconstruct the vertical turbulence profile. The accuracy limitations and its dependence on HTS design parameters such as frame rate, SHWFS resolution, noise, beacon ascent rate, as well as any other pertinent parameters will be fully defined and described.",The results of the Phase I designs will be utilized to establish the design requirements for an optimized HTS prototype system. This HTS system will be built and then used to collect dynamic HTS data which will be used to further develop and demonstrate the processing methods developed in Phase I.,"High energy DoD laser weapons offer benefits of graduated lethality, rapid deployment to counter time-sensitive targets, and the ability to deliver significant force either at great distance or to nearby threats with high accuracy for minimal collateral damage. Knowledge of the atmospheric turbulence along the shot path is a key limiting factor for lethality and as such it is a critical input for the fire control system.The Phase III effort shall be to design and build a system that could be integrated into an Army's High Energy Laser Weapon System for real time use as part of the fire control system. Military funding for this Phase III effort would be executed by the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Technical Center as part of its Directed Energy research.",1,"Andrei Tokovinin, ""Measurement of seeing and the atmospheric time constant by differential scintillations,"" Appl.

The model will quantify in a variety of different missile debris path configurations the vulnerability models used to reduce risk in WSMR-adjacent populations. This tool is required to handle the modern next generation calculations that are required for airborne hypersonic weapons in order to maintain proper Flight Safety Analysis processes.RAMOT should be a single, comprehensive, government-owned Flight Safety Analysis computing tool that relies heavily on software development and can take full advantage of modern computing power to determine risk levels with high fidelity. Risk analysis for the purposes of Flight Safety management is a time-intensive process which requires the capability to generate, interpret, and analyze large quantities of data. RAMOT requires advanced computational models that can give accurate estimates of vulnerabilities based on physical models rather than engineering estimates. As part of their flight safety analyst duties, operators are required to analyze risk for the missions being conducted on the range for a wide variety of programs involving many different configurations for missile flight debris path. The wide variety of missile types, trajectories, and flight termination systems requires detailed analysis for each mission, where the operator must accurately quantify the risk to both adjacent populations and property. In order to quantify the risk, the operator must be able to determine the vulnerability of things such as building, houses, aircraft, and unsheltered persons. Historically the vulnerability models have been based on empirical data or engineering estimates that can overstate or understate the associated risk. The intent of RAMOT is to provide accurate vulnerability models, more precisely quantify risk, and reduce the uncertainty associated with WSMR's current empirical processes, giving operators more confidence in the analysis.RAMOT is a Flight Safety requirement that should act as a next-generation one-stop-shop tool that supports the entire Flight Safety Analysis process. This process broadly consists of four steps: loading and extracting data, simulating vehicle behavior, trapping of state vectors, and risk analysis. Each step requires the generation or the processing of many (up to tens or hundreds of thousands) of trajectories.",369,2542,1,No,No,No,,"In RAMOT Phase I, a six-month study is proposed for determining the scientific and technical merit and Feasibility.","This phase will further develop the first phase, in which awards shall be made on the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of the Phase II proposal.

Is this the absolute thickness of all components or just the aerodynamic thickness of the antenna protruding from the airframe. That is, will any of the components, such as RF backend hardware be allowed to protrude into a compartment below the surface of the airframe?

 Will the metasurface antenna operate within a provided aircraft radome or should the antenna have it's own engineered radome?

The call requests tri-band operation. Through the careful design and selection of metasurface elements, it is possible to support multiple bands, however, this is an area of current academic research. Will the reviewers entertain proposals that consider one or two bands of operation for the phase I effort?

We are also interested in understanding the general application for the antennas to better tailor our proposal. The call asks to evaluate antenna locations on the side, bottom, and top. Will the antennas be used in satellite communication solutions or in air to ground application (or both?).
A: It could be possible for hardware to reside on the underside of the skin of the airframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be unlikely that there would be a big hole for a box to just drop in though.

It will need its own radome.

A solid proposal with 2 bands is better than 1 or none.&nbsp;&nbsp;We would certainly look at the novel approach that they propose and see how it can support.

Primary use case is for satellite communications.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are use cases for air to ground or air to air communication.

Q2 (04/29/2021): Will the direction of the Satellite be provided?
A: Yes, we would have to provide several look angles for various constellations.

Q3 (04/29/2021): Would a proposal that concentrates on the metamaterial antenna in Phase I with the rotor blade masking covered in a Phase II be acceptable?
A: Yes.&nbsp; The rotor blade masking is nothing really new.&nbsp; We can support the algorithm development there.&nbsp; It is the metamaterials that we really wish to focus on with this SBIR.

Q4 (04/26/2021): Will the direction of the Satellite be provided?
A: Yes, we would have to provide several look angles for various constellations.

Q5 (04/23/2021): 1) Is single-aperture full duplex required?
2) What gain is required?  
3) Is this intended to be a fixed-beam antenna, or to have electronic beamsteering?
4) If electronic beamsteering, is only the antenna (radiator) design required / acceptable, or are full beamsteering electronics required as well?
A: 1. A single aperature, full duplex design is desired.&nbsp; A second aperature would require additional real estate on the rotary wing fleet causing additional integration concerns.

2. Our approach is to not limit concepts/designs and so these values are intended as a guide.&nbsp;<br />
Ku Band:&nbsp; Gain&nbsp;30&nbsp;dBi&nbsp;<br />
K Band:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain 31&nbsp;dBi&nbsp;<br />
Ka Band: Gain 33dBi

3. Electronic beamsteering will give us the most flexibility and would be desired, however if there are other novel approaches that a business can come up with, we would certainly evaluate it.

4. The electronics being centrally located with the aperature would be ideal. That said, a vendor can propose to use an existing beamsteering algorithm and electronic payload and have it elsewhere.&nbsp;

Q6 (04/12/2021): 1.	What gain, polarization, side-lobe level, is required?
2.	What is the physical area available for the antenna system?
A: For flexibility the antenna needs to be able to change polarization (L/R CP, Linear) to support the intended constellation agnostic support. Space, Weight, and Power (SWaP) is a significant concern on Army aircraft.&nbsp; We are interested in novel concepts/approaches that minimize SWaP of the entire system.

Q8 (04/05/2021): Is the subject antenna intended to support communications with the new Starlink satellites?  Thank you.

The SBIR would also characterize the potential gains and tradeoffs of such a metamaterial-based topology.","Army aviation has the need of a broadband antenna with reduced size and weight while obtaining enhanced power efficiency and ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) frequency capability. Such a capability would contribute to the Army's superiority in multiple abilities, to include conducting joint air-ground operations, maintaining manned-unmanned teams, and operating in contested airspace. In addition, a physically low profile is needed for airborne applications to maintain aircraft aerodynamics and minimize surface clutter and interaction with other pre-existing equipment. Airborne platforms have limited surface area for antenna mounting, and it is often non-electrically conductive. These constraints require the antenna(s) to be ""electrically small,"" with a total height less than one quarter of a wavelength at its center frequency. It is envisioned that emerging developments and technology using metamaterials could provide a solution for such an antenna.The focus of this SBIR is to conduct research culminating in the development of a metamaterial-based antenna that will provide the desired performance for aircraft applications. Metamaterials are artificial engineered materials that possess a negative index of refraction for an isotropic medium. Their properties can be tailored to provide anomalous interactions with the electromagnetic field. These electromagnetic interactions include the effect of causing the electromagnetic waves phase and group velocity to have a reversed direction of propagation with the respect to the direction of energy flow, as well as, preventing reflected and scattered radiation return on active antenna surfaces. Utilization of left-handed materials (LHM), such as double negative materials (DNG) and epsilon near-zero permittivity (ENZ) materials enable the antenna size to be reduced while increasing the antenna efficiency and bandwidth. Legacy techniques, such as, utilization of split ring resonators (SRR) and complimentary SRRs (CSRR) in the substrate and superstrate of the PCB based antennas are known to increase the radio frequency (RF) bandwidth and directivity by manipulation of permittivity and permeability in specific frequency bands. Much metamaterial research and work has been competed during the last fifteen years. The challenge presented in this SBIR will be to combine multiple efforts and create a product that can perform in the aviation adverse environment and endure that grueling environment without failure in high operational situations. This also implies that the antenna must survive in extreme environmental conditions, to include heavy rainfall, high heat desert type temperatures, very cold environments covered with ice and snow, and continual abrading due to small particles such as sand. The antenna is expected to interface with a 50 ohm coaxial cable with a suitable high frequency capable connector. If power is required, it will be derived from 28 VDC aircraft power.",426,2951,1,No,No,No,,"The purpose of Phase I is to determine the engineering feasibility of designing and antenna with tri-band performance in portions of Ku, K, and Ka band. An engineering study will be conducted to explore the options and the design space of what is possible from a SWaP and antenna performance perspective. The trade space will include frequency bandwidth, antenna gain, and antenna efficiency versus the antenna height, length, width, and weight. Projected radiation patterns and polarization predictions are also required. The Army needs adequate antenna parameters and characteristics to predict how well the antenna would perform at various aircraft installation points. The antenna should also be capable of transmitting at least 40 Watts in the same bands. The primary objectives of Phase I are:Determine the feasibility of designing and airborne capable antenna Ku, K, and Ka tri-band operation.Develop a preliminary antenna design that would be compatible for the AH-64E (attack helicopter), CH-47F (heavy lift helicopter), UH-60M (medium lift helicopter), and Future Vertical Lift (FVL).Develop a concept of operation showing how the antenna could be utilized in Ku, K, and Ka band radio frequency (RF) scenarios (i.e., link distances and incident angles with respect to the aircraft).Perform an analysis of how the antenna would perform on top, side and bottom installations for AH-64E, CH-47F, UH-60M, and FVL aircraft.

Q19 (04/30/2021): Are the input and output voltage ranges per GCS-PRF-600A and MIL-STD-1275?
A: <p style=""margin-left:48px"">Power interfaces should comply with MIL-PRF-GCS600A and MIL-STD-1275E

Q20 (04/30/2021): What is the reasoning to limit to an 8-bit controller?
Is it possible to incorporate 16-bit or 32-bit controller, if design dictates?
A: That sentence was copied wrong. It is supposed to say &ldquo;The BDC should use the ARINC 600 form factor and be 8 MCU or smaller.&rdquo; There is no restriction on microcontrollers beyond supporting other requirements. The posting has been corrected to reflect this.

Q21 (04/23/2021): Within solicitation the following sentence is included:
 
The BDC should be 8 bit microcontroller (MCU) or smaller.
 
Can you explain this requirement in greater detail?  Presumably this excludes 16 and 32 bit microcontrollers.  Does this have anything to do with firmware: bare-metal logic vs operating system?  Does this limit BDC solution to only a single 8 bit controller?  Does this sentence exclude the use of high-speed FPGA fabric?  Is there any distinction between the application of a microcontroller in various sub-functions of the BDC, such as the communication interface vs the power controller stage?
A: That sentence was copied wrong. It is supposed to say &ldquo;The BDC should use the ARINC 600 form factor and be 8 MCU or smaller.&rdquo; There is no restriction on microcontrollers beyond supporting other requirements. The posting has been corrected to reflect this.

A: All questions must be submitted through DSIP now that open submission has begun.

Q23 (04/15/2021): 1. Can you provide the technical volume template (limited to 5 pages)? It's not in beta.sam.gov, nor in the firm-templates
2. Can you clarify the need for 8 bit MCU? any reason why 16 bit or 32bit MCU is not allowed?
3. Can you clarify the configurability requirement, if any?
4. Can you clarify the integration requirement, if any?
5. Is Liquid Cooling permitted?
6. Is there dimension constraint?
A: I apologize for the confusion. Please refer back to the overarching 21.4 BAA (see Appendix A) for what needs to be included in the technical volume. We do not have a template at this time but Appendix A has thorough instructions as to what needs to be included.

Currently, the HGU-56P helmet retrofit of lining material is capable of delivering threshold impact performance improvement of 20% over current Extended Polystyrene (EPS) foam.","At present, aviation helmets provide minimal impact protection due to weight limitations associated with crash load requirements. For example, if the helmet is too heavy under an otherwise survivable crash landing, the weight of the helmet cannot allow breaking the neck of the aviator. Optimal helmet design requires a balance between the need for protection from trauma and the comfort and practicality of the helmet for the user to ensure the best outcomes. New foam technology used in commercial industry promises superior crash protection with no impact on helmet weight. Improved impact protection to the user in a hard landing or crash scenario is a fundamental component of soldier lethality, one of the six army modernization priorities of the Army which includes the core requirement of communication.Intent of this proposal is to perform retrofit using a new material/design which spreads out impact load and cuts the energy absorbed by the user to reduce instances of brain injury/Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and concussion.

The Army would like to explore the utilization of novel thermal management systems for light to medium/heavy duty applications on current enduring rotorcraft and Future Vertical Lift (FVL) platforms.,"The U.S. Army is interested in identifying novel approaches for improving the thermal management and efficiency for aviation systems. Current thermal management systems are insufficient for future aviation applications due to high weight, lower heat rejection capabilities, and forced air systems predominately implemented on Army rotorcraft based on 1970's technology, which has had incremental improvements since. As advancements in power electronics, energy dense batteries, high-power dense electric machinery, small turbine machinery, and power generation units evolve, the thermal management requirements to operate these technologies efficiently, effectively, and safely is increasingly important for aviation implementation. By taking advantage of newer technologies, techniques, and approaches, the U.S. Army is seeking opportunities to explore advanced thermal management solutions for aviation applications that meet size, weight, performance and cost (SWaP-C) requirements.The following would be accomplished by but not limited to: advanced manufacturing techniques, additive manufacturing, passive/active cooling, fuel cooling applications, innovative heat exchangers and cooling plates, novel rejection techniques and the application of novel materials.Classified proposals are not accepted under the DoD SBIR Program.

Designs may include simulation models of the key enabling technology benefits and risks over current state of the art cooling technologies. Designs shall seek to improve thermal efficiency and thermal cooling capacity while improving or not compromising SWaP-C requirements. Designs may also consider opportunities to modify existing systems, especially those utilized on Army Aviation platforms today, to achieve effective solutions. The Army would like to have an understanding of the areas of improvement of current systems in addition to the trade spaces and technology innovations required for an enhanced thermal management system.A report should be delivered to the Army that documents the design decisions the Army could make when utilizing an innovative thermal management system. If possible, a demo would be desired.","During Phase II, the Army would desire working prototypes with simulated aircraft loads and heat dissipating component. Phase II will leverage component and system level knowledge gained from Phase I and build a prototype that integrates with the aircraft.A laboratory environment would be required to simulate the aircraft architecture. Initial qualification testing and analyses will occur during this phase to reduce risks for meeting Army certification requirements. The Army desires testing performed that would demonstrate the most optimal setup for their thermal management system required for Army rotorcraft.The final deliverable would be a report with testing and design data that would give the Army a path forward.","During Phase III, the Army desires to pursue full qualification of the components and aircraft integration/testing on UH-60 (a medium utility helicopter), AH-64 (an attack helicopter), CH-47 (a heavy-lift helicopter), and/or FVL. Also, it is envisioned that this technology will have applicability to commercial aircraft market.
