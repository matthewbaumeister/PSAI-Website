The U.S. Navy has embraced this model, with its current implementation of FORCEnet, in which the command and control architecture becomes a ""comprehensive network of sensors, analysis tools, and decision aids to support the full array of naval activities, from combat operations to logistics and personnel development.” (VADM Mayo, Feb 2003) While the importance of the ""human in the loop” has been emphasized, there has been little work done to analyze the impact of this architecture on the individual operator. Persistent and pervasive sensors, rapid action requirements, and reduced manning initiatives necessitate the development of methods for transforming information delivery, instilling knowledge and enabling an understanding of military decision-makers operations within this seamless, networked environment. In addition to challenges to the individual operator, the military is currently using ad hoc solutions to tackle the shared awareness issues inherent in distributed command and control – cell phones, two way pagers, text-based chat (e.g. Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Lotus Sametime, etc.) and instant messenger applications have filled in the gaps where tools specifically designed for collaboration are noticeably absent. This lack of formal policy or an empirical understanding of best practices requires remediation. Future military operations will continue to be Joint and Coalition efforts in the 21st century, thus the transformation of data into actionable knowledge and its fusion into a common operational picture is critical for all of our Services and allies. The creation of a ubiquitous Battlespace that will allow and ensure that data becomes information and knowledge remains a significant challenge: we must ensure that 1) data is presented to all manner of war fighters as meaningful, actionable information and thereby becomes internalized as knowledge, and 2) effective collaborative tools exist that facilitate knowledge sharing.",307,2083,1,No,No,No,,"Phase 1 of this effort should involve an analysis of a specific task environment and how it might benefit from recent developments in knowledge management, information science, cognitive science/neuroscience, human factors and basic psychological research.

The need for high-quality monitoring of the medical condition of soldiers recovering from battle-related injuries can significantly delay, and in some cases prevent, their return to independent living. DARPA is interested in the development of innovative, low-cost, non-invasive ""trip-wire” systems capable of monitoring injured and recovering veterans and detecting problems with their recovery. The envisioned health-monitoring system is expected to provide both a safety net that can detect when the soldier needs assistance and a detection/prediction capability that enables the system to advise health care providers of changes in important medical indicators, e.g., decrease in mobility. In terms of technical approach, this implies that simple sensor-only solutions will not be effective. Instead, solutions must integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) or cognitive systems technologies with sensors (or sensor data), to provide a reasoning capability that enables the system to detect and diagnose trends rather than monitor for single data points. To illustrate, a 30% decrease in mobility over a one week period is a trend whereas a body temperature reading of 98F is a single data point. These capabilities are important to all recovering soldiers and are even more important to those who live alone. This research must address the challenges presented by a recovering soldier who is likely to be suffering from multiple injuries and is at the same time generally active. The recovering soldier is also likely to exhibit changing medical and behavioral profiles as he/she heals and becomes more adept at using wheel chairs, prosthetic limbs or other assistive devices. Conversely, in the early stages of using such devices or in the early stages of recovery, the likelihood of new injury or mishap is also greater. DARPA is seeking solutions that will benefit soldiers with a wide variety of impairments who are ready to make a transition back to independent life. Integrated approaches are preferred and should include technologies for in-home sensing, monitoring and diagnosing medical conditions, and communicating summary results and alerts to appropriate medical personnel. Proposed approaches must address reasoning with uncertainty, discriminating between changes that are within normal variation and those indicating a problem, and minimize false alarms. Offerors must describe how the proposed research effort will protect individual’s privacy rights, is cost effective, and does not place additional burden on healthcare professionals and volunteer caregivers (e.g., the person’s family).

As evidenced by the attacks of Sep 11, 2001, as well as the tactics of Iraqi insurgents and other terrorist groups, asymmetric warfare necessitates a change in that paradigm. In the presence of attacks focused on underlying or surrounding infrastructure (for example, the civilian infrastructure and population around a military base), point defense is no longer sufficient. The fundamental principles of military operations are still valid, but the tactics, techniques, and procedures used to apply them to this type of threat must change [1]. Specifically, assessments must address interdependencies and vulnerabilities of very different targets (fixed as well as mobile, permanent as well as temporary) across broad geographic areas and against a wide variety of attack methods. Classical risk assessment methodologies [2, 3] continue to evolve, are widely available, and in most cases are sufficient for assessing risks to a single building or small facility with clearly defined and well understood vulnerabilities. For large installations such as military bases, current assessment methods lack the needed capability of comparing, integrating, and prioritizing vulnerabilities involving multiple infrastructures in a larger geographic area. Any large military installation relies on numerous types of infrastructure, individually and collectively critical to carrying out the installation’s mission. In one specific example, the base has several gas pipelines, fed by a ""town border station” dozens of miles away, interfacing between a transmission pipeline and the local distribution network. Similarly, the base is served by one or more electrical substations, also remote from the base, as well as possessing on-site backup generation, with an accompanying store of diesel fuel sufficient for two to four days’ supply. On the base, there are multiple mission-critical functions, each of which is served from a separate building: base HQ, including strategic command and the main communications nexus; tactical ops, providing logistical support including the current readiness posture; and the data center, providing core computing and networking services. Both on-base and external communication networks are provided by a combination of dedicated T1, fiber optics, and microwave relay. Additional infrastructure includes water supply, for human consumption, sanitation, and cooling (most critically for the data center.) Each of these systems is interdependent with the others. For example, gas-fired heating systems rely on electricity to run the pumps and fans. Each presents different levels of risk, and requires different preparation and expense for a successful attack. The most attractive attacks from the attackers’ point of view are determined not only by the difficulty of the attack, but by their resources and objectives. For example, a terrorist attack focused on generating maximum media coverage might involve coordinated attacks on electrical transmission (at the remote substation), a gas leak just outside the installation boundary subsequently ignited to generate a fuel-air explosion, and disruption of the water supply to hinder fire-fighting efforts, timed to coincide with a large, planned gathering of military personnel. On the other hand, an attack aimed at disrupting the installation’s support of an ongoing mission might target fuel deliveries, or Command, Control and Communications (C3) communications infrastructure, for example through a coordinated cyber attack on computer and networking facilities. DARPA seeks creative new approaches to providing automated vulnerability assessments that are robust, repeatable, and address infrastructure interdependences and evolving threats. When deployed, the solution should require only minimal training of security personnel and have a means to ensure the completeness and validity of the assessed data inputs. The solution should provide a means to capture existing expertise, incorporate the latest global and local intelligence, capture and securely share the knowledge created during assessments, and provide actionable output to enable base operations and security personnel to prioritize and direct security investments, enhance security training, and update policing procedures. Research Challenges: Providing an automated, adaptive vulnerability assessment tool will require innovative solutions to several interrelated problems: • Representing the multiple infrastructures involved in such a way that interrelationships can be reasoned about. These relationships may include physical proximity, functional dependence, or synergy as a ""covering set” (e.g., remove all sources of electrical power.) • Representing the cost, time, resources, and risk involved in specific infrastructure attacks. • Representing and reasoning about the objectives, resources, and capabilities of a potential attacker or attackers, in a form that supports reasoning about what kinds of attacks are most attractive/most likely for a given class of attacker. • Knowledge capture for the process of vulnerability assessment, so that candidate vulnerabilities are generated and analyzed in a systematic, focused, and effective manner. • Knowledge and model updating: the system must be able to incorporate new information, for example regarding infrastructure changes to the installation, or intelligence reports providing new data on attacker capabilities and objectives. The system should also be able to use the results of previous analyses (its own and others’) in subsequent analysis. Relevant Technologies: Potentially relevant technologies include automated reasoning systems (expert systems, proof verifiers, model checkers), dynamic logics and other means of automated scenario generation, heuristic search (for scenario generation), geometric and geographical representation and reasoning, cognitive modeling of the attacker, probabilistic and uncertain reasoning, and learning.",851,6054,1,No,No,No,,Prepare a feasibility study to design an automated system for vulnerability assessment.

Recent developments in enhanced AUV capabilities and distributed planning and control of multi-agent systems offer a unique opportunity to satisfy this need. The basic constraint in undersea surveillance is very limited communication and high rate of false alarms. The use of a network of mobile (on AUVs) and stationary sensors is promising, but search planning and sensor management functions must be distributed and decentralized to minimize communication and maximize robustness to failures. The area of distributed collaborative planning and control of networked systems under communication constraints is an active area of research in control theory. The basic foundations of stochastic control under limited information were laid down by Witsenhausen over 30 years ago, but little progress has been made in solving these problems.

Accurate, detailed 3D models of urban environments are rapidly becoming available using a variety of sources, such as Lasar Radar (LADAR), photogrammetry, stereo vision radar, video, and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models. Concurrent advances in visualization and display technology are required to realize the full value of the newly available 3D models. Key challenges encountered in defense applications include: (1) developing a holistic 3D display of a scene, including building exteriors, interiors, trees, vegetation, signs, wires, and vehicles, from multiple perspectives and orientations; (2) design and development of large format displays that facilitate effective communication of geospatial structures among groups of people; (3) incorporation of dynamic and moving entities within 3D visualizations; and (4) facilitating high-fidelity walk-through of 3D scenes and structures. DARPA seeks novel methods to achieve these goals for high-resolution display of urban scenes, with emphasis placed on versatile, configurable display and visualization systems capable of sustaining dynamic, real-time updates. Approaches should incorporate new display modalities, rather than merely enabling faster rendering of complex scenes.

It can be shown that in many applications these systems are timeline, not power-aperture limited. This is due to scheduling/timeline constraints imposed by the aperture. An example of such a constraint is the inability of current higher-power RF systems to support time-concurrent transmission and reception from the same aperture. Several component technologies must be developed before this type of concurrency is readily available. Current pulsed architectures typically use switches and circulators to provide isolation between transmit and receive ports. Switches are used to isolate transmit and receive circuitry by effectively turning off the receive port while transmitting. These switches preclude simultaneous transmit and receive and hence will not be a part of any STAR technology solution. The circulator, on the other hand, does not preclude STAR, does provides some isolation between transmit and receive ports, and hence worthy of study and development for STAR architectures. DARPA would like to focus development of circulators relevant to STAR architectures at microwave frequencies, most notably X-Band. In particular, DARPA is interested in circulators that provide much better trades into operational and instantaneous bandwidths (better than 15% instantaneous and 30% operational), insertion losses (not to exceed .5dB), power handling capabilities (in excess of a few Watts average), isolation between transmit and receive ports (greater than 40dB), and a form-factor such that it fits comfortably in an X-band lattice (~ ½ inch on a side) along with other transmit / receive circuitry.",253,1724,1,No,No,No,,Develop concepts for high performance circulators meeting or preferably exceeding expectations expressed above.

Susceptibility refers to the ability to avoid detection that leads to a weapons engagement. Recent tradition has broadly equated air vehicle survivability in a hostile environment with detectability. As such, the focus has been on practices and methods to reduce the electro-magnetic signature of the air vehicle below the threshold of detectability. Unquestionably, signature reduction will improve survivability but it is an expensive technique. Vulnerability refers to the ability of an air vehicle to withstand a weapons attack.

These short pulses can contain most of the spectral frequencies that span over several Gigahertz of spectrum. Radio communication systems using Giga-band signals will not only be more efficient in use of the spectrum, but will also be more difficult to detect and jam. The consequences of this simple principle are nothing less than revolutionary. Multi gigabit-per-second radio communications, sensors and processing will enable a new generation of brilliant networks, self-aware wireless devices and secure military solutions. Conventional, narrowband (less than 10% instantaneous bandwidth) technologies have a well-developed set of tools, technologies, and architectures that are used throughout industry. This effort seeks to leverage the design and modeling tools that have been developed for narrowband systems, but for much wider bandwidth signaling paradigms, Giga-band signals. Based on the ability to transmit, receive, and decode very short pulses, the full exploitation of Giga-band technology requires a new set of circuit techniques for implementation at the chip-scale. This topic seeks innovative ideas on the implementation of new circuit techniques and approaches for integrated Giga-band chips. As examples, zero (or near zero) bias pulse amplifiers are needed to fully realize the power savings of Giga-band pulsed radio systems. Another example is the delay element. In most implementations, a Giga-band pulsed radio system will use delay lines in an analogous fashion to the banks of filters that are usually used in narrowband systems. On-chip, efficient, low dispersion delay lines will enable a host of design options, depending on their delay time and precision. A third example is pulse generation techniques.

Smaller scale integrated circuits have already been demonstrated with multi-GHz data rates. The performance of printed wiring board (PWB) technologies that provide chip-to-chip interconnections have increased at very modest rates as compared to the chips. For electrical interconnect technology, the primary limitations to implementing high-speed interconnections are frequency-dependent loss and high power dissipation. Creative silicon interfaces have been developed to compensate for the loss resulting from current passive interconnects. The silicon interfaces add complexity, cost and power to high-speed interfaces sending high frequency signals over current passive electrical interconnects. Next-generation advanced information processing systems, such as those expected to be used in real-time synthetic aperture radar imaging, automatic target recognition, and intensive medical image processing, will require large aggregate computational and communication bandwidths. Since most of these systems are assembled from multiprocessor, memory, and special-purpose digital signal processing chips, the ideal communication bandwidths between them need to be on the order of a Terabit/sec in order to handle the real-time, high-resolution and large images (such as those generated by a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to be processed. Today, using conventional electronic off-chip wiring, the chips inherent speed cannot be fully utilized, and traditional electrical interconnect techniques utilizing conventional material system for example FR4-based Printed Circuit Board (PCB) are a limiting bottleneck in terms of speed, density, wiring length, cross talk and driving power [1] Materials such as alumina, GTEK, etc., that meet these requirements traditionally have been priced much higher than conventional FR4 boards. Optical interconnections are anticipated to alleviate this problem in the off-chip interconnects. However, optical interconnect techniques remain costly, dissipate considerable power, and are still far beyond the present in practical application in most PWB technologies.

Such circuits are vital to the functionality and performance of modern DoD systems. It is essential that those integrated circuits be trustworthy or the performance, functionality, or mission of a system could be compromised.

The long range objective is to develop a new propulsion technology base that can achieve efficiencies above 40% while achieving the environmental cleanliness, power to weight ratios, and low vibration of today’s turbo-machine engines","The Humphrey cycle is a thermodynamic cycle that combines the best features of Otto (internal combustion engine) and Brayton (turbo engine) thermodynamic cycles. The Humphrey cycle includes constant volume combustion (CVC) like that found in a piston-crank or Wankel engine as well as full working gas expansion like that found in a turbo-engine. As a result of greater ideal thermodynamic efficiency, Humphrey cycle based engines promise significant improvements in efficiency and power production. The most commonly suggested implementation of a Humphrey cycle is as a pulse detonated engine1 (PDE) or with the addition of a wave rotor2, 3 pressure exchanger. Although studied for decades, these implementations have proven to have limitations that are preventing their transition from the laboratory. An approximate Humphrey cycle implementation using a piston-crank engine is commonly called a Miller cycle engine. Miller cycle engines are being successfully used in marine engines and special transportation applications; however, Miller engines have the same vibration, weight, fuel restrictions, and complexity issues that limit piston-crank engines in comparison to turbo-shaft engines. This topic principally seeks to stimulated and develop Humphrey cycle engines, other then PDE, Wave Rotor, or Piston-Crank engines, that have the full efficiency promise of the cycle and achieve the high power to weight ratios, low-vibration, environmental cleanliness, and fuel flexibility typical of turbo-engines. It is also open to other propulsion or engine concepts which may provide similar advantages in practical implementation. Since it is imagined that this engine would have wide application to transportation power there are many military and commercial missions that can take advantage of this more efficient and functional engine. The risk associated with this project is the potential difficulty to achieve smooth combustion and continuous operation of this engine across a range of fuel air mixtures and engine speeds. In addition, a successful engine must have the feature of good mechanical balance that will allow low vibration with no major impact to power performance.

Recently these methods have been applied to the study of conformational changes during ion channel gating and to enzyme dynamics during catalysis. Military applications include the development of refined methods for rational drug design and rapid vaccine development for chemical and biological countermeasures. The temporal and spatial resolution of FRET techniques is currently limited by the output intensity of the probes and the ‘spectrum crowding’ that occurs due to the width of individual probe emission spectra. Temporal resolutions on the order of 10-25 milliseconds and spatial resolutions on the order of 1-5 nm is currently considered the state of the art in FRET-based measurement techniques. Increased output intensity will enable improved temporal resolution due to the reduction in time required to collect the requisite number of photons for accurate measurement. A narrowing of the emission spectra will enable an increase in the number of probes that can be measured simultaneously, thus enabling an increase in the number of protein degrees of freedom that can be measured in a single test.

General purpose processors architectures often are ill suited to perform specialized processing or simply can not meet the performance requirements necessary for a DoD application. Custom circuitry that could provide the required performance is prohibitively costly and requires significant development and fabrication time, and as a result is unavailable to provide required processing solutions. As a result, a significant number of DoD applications turn to FPGAs as a computational solution. FPGAs can be uniquely configured to perform specific processing implementations, are commercially available, and do not require custom fabrication times or cost. However, FPGAs have several limitations themselves – lower efficiency than custom implementations, higher power than custom implementations, and difficulty and complexity for programmability. Specifically the difficulty to program and implement FPGA solutions is a key issue to DoD application developers and drive application cost and schedule. While the Polymorphous Computing Architectures (PCA) program and follow on efforts are addressing these issues from a new architectural approach, FPGA solutions will continue to be critical for many DoD applications to provide cheap, near-term, customizable processing solutions. This activity proposes to specifically address the difficulty to program and utilize FPGA implementations. Currently development tools for FPGAs are limited in scope, characterized is hard to use, and requires detailed hardware knowledge of the FPGA. The application and algorithm developer are separated from the implementation as a result, leading to inefficiencies, incorrect implementation, and unacceptable development times. These issues will be addressed by this effort. Development tools and approaches to advance the development and programmability of FPGAs and enable critical DoD application implementations will be identified and evaluated. This SBIR topic will identify, evaluate, and propose further advancements in FPGA application and implementation development tools and approaches and develop these toward a complete development environment that will allow high level, application developers to transition application designs efficiently onto FPGA implementations without requiring detailed hardware knowledge of the implementation or difficult and error-prone intermediate transitions.

The ability to process information with extremely low demands on cognitive and attentional resources would be useful across a huge range of situations and domains. For example, soldiers en route to a mission deployment could brief or rehearse mission-specific information while ""on the march” or in transport. Alternatively, soldiers engaged in complicated navigation, planning and coordination tasks could nevertheless maintain awareness of critical vehicle and mission performance parameters and be able to readily detect when such parameters begin to deviate from expectations and be immediately aware of available courses of action all without losing focus on other, ongoing tasks. Recent advances across multiple fields ranging from augmented cognition technologies to novel display design approaches provide various techniques that could be brought together to create novel, human-focused ELADIS systems. The goal of this research will be to discover and develop techniques to improve the ""bandwidth” of useful information transfer for the expenditure of available attentional resources. Particularly of interest are approaches whose demands on attentional resources are as insignificant as to go unnoticed by the information receiver and/or to produce negligible degradation of other ongoing tasks. ELADISs might operate by being aware of and managing available resources so as to provide training or refreshing information only when sufficient resources may be diverted from other tasks to process it. Additionally, approaches which make use of optimal modalities (or combinations of modalities) and/or more effective information presentation methods and/or effective cognitive preparation for information uptake might serve to reduce the proportion of attentional resources required to process required information. Finally, novel approaches might make it possible to make use of resources in contexts and conditions where they were previously deemed unavailable or insufficient (e.g., extreme fatigue or degraded consciousness states).

Even tools as basic as email and online chat systems have proven to be great force multipliers in a wide range of settings from logistics management to air operations centers. This topic focuses on the next generation of online collaboration – distributed collaboration between human parties and sophisticated software systems or ""intelligent agents.” While generalized software intelligence is still very far away, recent advances have made it possible to create automated systems that perform sophisticated tasks in specialized domains, e.g., weather analysis to support air operations planning. When such domain dependent or specialized intelligent core programs are combined with sophisticated software for communication, information sharing, reasoning about time, dealing with world dynamics, etc., they are called intelligent agents. For this topic, we seek proposals to create intelligent problem solving networks consisting of humans and intelligent agents. Conceptually the idea is to create a problem solving Internet where expertise is shared in a collaborative fashion across a dynamic organization that is formed in response to a given need or request. The goal is to leverage the distributed human expertise to the nth degree by allowing experts to flexibly and dynamically interact with each other and with intelligent agents to solve problems. Conceptually the model is to have a pool of human experts and intelligent agents, all specializing in a particular areas, and then to have outside clients (e.g., commanders) submit work to the pool of experts and have the pool of experts dynamically organize and perform the work or solve the problem. Note that in the long term vision, this pool of experts may not be a dedicated resource of the network, i.e., these human experts may have multiple roles in multiple organizations and participate in a given problem solving session on an as needed / as appropriate basis. Proposed research should focus on the basic human/agent collaborative problem solving issues. Examples include information sharing between humans and agents (low level, intermediate, results, etc.), joint problem solving, joint goals, mixed initiatives, adjustable autonomy, ontology for the specialized domain, distributed autonomous progress tracking, role assignment, capabilities descriptors, etc. Proposers may suggest other novel areas of research. The goal of the work, however, is to create a usable tool in a specialized domain. Proposers may choose the domain, though domains that are militarily relevant are preferred. The domain or candidate domains should be specified in the proposal.

Such technologies are often applied to autonomous software systems rather than robotic systems because limitations in other areas such as computer vision or effector dexterity prevent robotic teamwork in very general or unconstrained settings. Open or unconstrained environments can similarly impede the online planning or coordination algorithms that might be used to control the robots. However, in properly scoped and constrained environments, e.g., robotic soccer, the sensor issues and the planning/control issues are controlled enough to yield reasonable proof of concept results for robotic teamwork. This topic seeks new research in the joint space of sophisticated software control and robotic systems. The challenge is to create a system demonstrating the use of multiple robots with one or more humans on a highly constrained tactical maneuver. The maneuver can be selected by the proposers. One example of such a maneuver is the through-the-door procedure often used by police and soldiers to enter an urban dwelling. This maneuver generally involves multiple parities who work in concert, e.g., one kicks in the door then pulls back so another can enter low and move left, followed by another who enters high and moves right, etc. In this project the teams will consist of robot platforms working with one or more human teammates as a cohesive unit. The robots should be under autonomous control rather than remote / teleoperated. Proposers can make simplifying assumptions when selecting the maneuver and can assume a simplified environment, e.g., no steps leading up to the door. Environmental characteristics can also be simplified, e.g., robot controllers do not need to plan or coordinate in completely unconstrained settings. The human(s) should have an active role in the maneuver. For instance, if one views the team as all sharing the same plan, one step in that plan may involve the human performing some human specific task, e.g., instructing the robots where to stand initially relative to the door or using the (better) human visual system to indicate where on the door the first robot should apply pressure in order to open or break the door. Proposals that focus on interdependent tasks between the human and robots will be preferred, i.e., where the human and robotic platforms must operate as a team on concert. Simplifying assumptions can be made about the physical strength of the robots, e.g., robots do not need to break down the door but may simply apply pressure to open it. A non-realistic scale may be chosen for this project, i.e., smaller robots may be used, to avoid large overhead cost in platform development.

To achieve successful collaboration in the context of a military operation, these autonomous entities (which have their own sets of interests and operating constraints) need to be able to cooperate, coordinate and negotiate effectively. Traditional centralized optimization approaches for solving this class of dynamic resource allocation problems typically decompose what is known as a master problem into subproblems, each of which is optimized subject to a local resource budget assigned by the system. Each subproblem yields a local solution as well as a sensitivity analysis (called dual variables) that is used to modify the local budgets iteratively to improve the solution with respect to global goals. These centralized approaches suffer from several weaknesses in practice: (1) the computational time can scale poorly with the number of iterations and subproblems; (2) entities represented by a given subproblem (e.g., a commercial air carrier participating in a military airlift) may not want to reoptimize over multiple budget scenarios or share information that can aid a competitor; and (3) the solution is fragile to uncertainty in the environmental state, which may require repeating the optimization process (often from scratch) as changes occur over time. DARPA seeks distributed algorithms and negotiation protocols (rules of interaction among entities) for performing dynamic resource and task allocation among autonomous parties that do not share the vulnerabilities of centralized algorithms and have relevance to DoD problems. There has been prior work in dividing goods or resolving conflict among autonomous parties [1, 2, 3] and in designing domain-specific negotiation protocols [5], including DoD applications [4]. However, what is needed is a more general methodology for designing negotiation protocols appropriate for a given operational setting. In addition to specifying how members can interact and the obligations each member has with respect to satisfying the group objective, the methodology should include the system properties (such as efficiency, stability, simplicity and symmetry) associated with a given set of protocols. There also needs to be a complementary infrastructure to perform the negotiation, which may include an auction infrastructure for different bidding mechanisms or a trading infrastructure by which members can propose an exchange of a subset of resources and tasks of another member. Successful completion of this research will greatly facilitate real-time logistics, allowing optimizations to be more robust, more responsive to environmental changes, and better able to leverage the ""best practices” of the individual members without having to integrate those practices into military systems or to share the expertise with commercial competitors.",439,3038,1,No,No,No,,Assess feasibility of proposed approach by developing and evaluating a subset of the negotiation protocols proposed.

For digital links, bias control accuracy is not critical. In contrast, the spurious free dynamic range of an analog fiber optic link is critically dependent on the accuracy of the bias control. For the case of Mach-Zehnder intensity modulators biased at quadrature, bias accuracy of less than 1o is often needed to meet the linearity requirements of wideband surveillance applications. Electronic bias control circuits typically apply a low frequency dither signal to the modulator, and lock onto the quadrature point by minimizing the 2nd harmonic of the dither signal via a feedback loop. The spur free dynamic range (SFDR) of the link is limited by both error in locking onto quadrature, and by intermodulation of the dither signal with signals of interest (which cause in-band spurious signals). As such, it is desirable to minimize the modulation index (< 0.01%) of the dither signal so that the dynamic range of the link is not limited by intermodulation of the dither signal. Finally, in order to maintain the optimal link gain, it is important to minimize the fraction of the optical power diverted from the signal path to the bias control feedback loop. Improvements in lasers, optical modulators, and photodetectors are enabling application of analog fiber optic link technology to a wider range of commercial and military RF systems with critical noise figure and SFDR requirements. The availability of integrated bias control for analog links will accelerate the adoption of RF-over-fiber technology. This topic seeks innovative approaches to optical modulator bias stability, either through intrinsic design or electronic control. Performance goals for the integrated bias control should include bias control error < 1o, an operating temperature range from -45o C to +85o C. It should be expected that the modulator will operate with optical input power between 16 dBm and 22 dBm. A candidate optical modulator with which the bias controller should operate is expected to have an optical insertion loss (including bias control tap loss) < 4 dB, a Vƒà < 4.5 V and a modulation bandwidth from 30 MHz to 18 GHz.

The SiGe infrared sensor systems should be capable of adequately substituting for mid-wavelength infrared (3 - 5 microns) imagers and sensors made from such exotic materials as Indium Antimonide (InSb) or Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe).,"Current infrared imaging systems, missile guidance sensors, and threat detection sensors are made from InSb or HgCdTe materials. Sensor systems based on these materials are expensive because of the difficulties of synthesizing and processing the materials. The HgCdTe materials system, for example, can only be grown on small size substrates. A resulting wafer with device structures on it is then difficult to process into sensors because of the softness of the material; this is a consequence of the relatively weak atomic bond between atoms of Mercury and Tellurium in the compound material. Once fabricated into sensors, the resulting component then must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures for optimal operation. Since signal conditioning and processing electronics cannot be made from the same materials, silicon electronic read-out chips must be hybridized with the InSb or HgCdTe sensor devices, adding to the complexity and cost of the sensor system. The popularity of these exotic infrared materials is due to their high sensitivity to radiation covering the spectral bands from 3 -5 and 8 -12 microns. All blackbodies (warm to hot objects), however, emit large quantities of infrared photons ranging in wavelength from about 0.9 to 12 microns. The quantity of infrared photons in the near-infrared (0.9 – 2 microns) is relatively small compared to what it is at the mid- to long-wave region of his spectrum. It is therefore feasible to extract a weak signature from a warm body by using detectors that operate in the 0.9 – 1.5 micron region. This topic seeks concepts in advanced infrared sensors that are based on SiGe technology, a material which has primarily been used for Bipolar - Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor circuits (BiCMOS) and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) digital chips. SiGe is also known to be a good optical detector with a spectral peak at the infrared wavelength of 1.3 micron, and could therefore be used to detect the scarce photons emitted by warm bodies in the absence of or in lieu of an optimal InSb or HgCdTe detector at the mid-wave band. Concepts proposed for the near-infrared SiGe sensors should seek to exploit the advantages of this material. Such advantages include room-temperature operation, compatibility with mainstream CMOS technology and therefore the potential to include sophisticated signal conditioning and processing electronics on the same chip as the sensor.",383,2430,1,No,No,No,,Conduct feasibility study of an infrared sensor based on SiGe material and its ability to detect photons emitted by a warm or a hot body.

The resonator- waveguide coupling should be adjustable on a timescale of microseconds by an appropriate on-chip MEMS structure.,"Light can be confined by resonant recirculation in toroidal microcavities with very small volumes. An ideal cavity would confine light with very low loss (for a long time) and would have narrow resonant frequencies at precisely defined values, with the number of resonances inversely proportional to the cavity volume (V). Real cavities are described by the cavity Q factor, which is proportional to the confinement time in units of optical period, and the volume V. Since in most microcavities optical trajectories occur near the surface, their performance strongly depends upon interface quality and the degree of surface smoothness. Using combinations of Si and SiO2, materials compatible with silicon microelectronics, microcavities with Q~5 x 107 have been prepared. [1] Many applications of high-Q resonators depend on transfer of optical power between the resonator and an adjacent waveguide, or between pairs of waveguides. For resonant power transfer with high efficiency the resonator-waveguide coupling coefficient must be greater than the intrinsic round-trip loss of the microcavity. An example of such a device would be a low-loss four port resonant optical coupler based on toroidal microcavities with a loaded Q (defined as the overall quality factor of the resonator including coupling to waveguides) greater than 106. [2] In addition to forming narrow band filters such devices offer inherently highly dispersion allowing for sophisticated manipulation of the phase or group delay response.

In most cases the entire sensor image is captured and transmitted with minimal compression to optimize image quality and information content. High frame rate (30 frames per second) imaging applications can easily exceed data rates of 300 megabits per second for uncompressed imagery generated by today’s relatively small megapixel (1K by 1K) sensors. As sensors increase in size and pixel count, the demand for data throughput will continue to outstrip available data transmission capabilities. Recent developments in active pixel sensors (APS) in a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit provide advanced features for on-chip processing of multiple, simultaneous localized regions (foveations) within a single CMOS sensor array. Such a capability could enable a single sensor array to partition its processing load by varying the resolution and frame rate within regions of the array in response to onboard cues or external commands.

Toxic industrial chemicals include well known substances such as ammonia, chlorine, and hydrogen fluoride which are considered to be highly toxic, to lesser known materials such as acrolein and chloroacetaldehyde. The threat from TICS, while not being as lethal as traditional chemical agents, is enhanced due to the vast quantities produced and the ease of access to the materials compared to chemical agents. Additionally, most chemical agent detectors are not configured to detect TICS, thus exposure may not be recognized until significant exposure has occurred. The use of the military in urban areas will likely increase the risk to the warfighter of exposure to TICS used as weapons either through direct exposure or through the introduction of the chemical into the food and/or water sources used by the troops. TICS also pose a risk to the general population due to the proximity of chemical manufacturing and usage facilities to population centers. The goal of this effort is to take advantage of advances in nanofabrication technologies to develop small sensors for TICS that incorporate nanoscale features along with microfluidics to increase sensitivity while reducing reagent and power requirements. Any proposed sensor should be able to detect a wide range of TICS and/or be easily reconfigurable in order to detect additional chemicals. Additionally, proposed sensors should be designed with the following considerations in mind: 1) low power consumption operation, 2) capability for remote operation, including wireless data transmission, and 3) ruggedized construction of small reconfigurable sensors for use in battlefield scenarios such as mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) and/or unmanned ground vehicles (UGV’s).

There is immediate need to address these limitations to achieve a small IR camera that weighs less than 10 grams and possesses state-of-the-art sensitivity that can be integrated directly on Micro Air Vehicle platforms (e.g., DARPA’s Wasp MAV). Weight savings will be achieved through the exploitation of the multifunctional materials concept. For example, by imprinting the structural MAV components with Focal Plane Array (FPA) and readout circuitry to provide more efficient packaging, thermal management, incorporation of novel lens assemblies and communication antennas into the airframe it may be possible to achieve reduced weight, and, therefore, increased endurance [1-3].",157,1071,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a feasibility study on transferring FPA circuits from rigid to flex substrates using die level elements on plastic with more efficient packaging, improved cooling, and incorporation of novel lens assemblies.

Examples of SFF include Stereolithography, 3-D Printing, Fused Deposition and Laminate Object Manufacturing. Many of these processes have been used to manufacture metal component via powder metallurgy. In powder metallurgy large seed grains may be oriented in the ‘green state’ to control crystal texture via secondary grain growth. Since tensor properties of material depend on crystal orientation, it would be useful to control properties spatially within a component to enhance the performance of components. Development of machine capabilities for the spatial control of crystal texture (for each voxel or volume element) provides a method of making things that can’t be manufactured by conventional manufacturing methods. Each proposal must include a Defense relevant challenge problem for manufacture where the spatial control of crystal texture is essential to the enhanced performance. A few examples are given of suitable challenge problems although the proposer may choose any Defense relevant problem. 1. Depleted Uranium (DU) is used as a ballistic penetrator in part because of its self sharpening behavior. Proper orientation of shear planes in another material without self sharpening behavior could be used to change its failure behavior to enhance penetration. 2. Single crystal turbine blades have superior creep rupture properties compared to polycrystalline turbine blades but the manufacturing process is slow and therefore expensive. Proper orientation of seed grains might be used to self assemble single crystal turbine blades complete with internal cooling passages. 3. Magnetic pole pieces can be designed such that magnetic field strength is enhanced by orienting the crystallographic axis with the highest permeability to follow the field lines in the magnet.

These systems are typically static in nature, and predetermined prior to deployment. If mission dynamics or system performance change, these systems are limited to their originally pre-determined mode of operation, resulting in inefficient use of resources and performance penalties at best and catastrophic failure at worst. An example of a potentially inefficient use of resources and system limitations could be illustrated for multi-tasking systems. Efficient pre-set, static utilization of system resources for multiple tasks will be difficult to establish given dynamic mission requirements. Priorities would be fixed and resources explicitly set given pre-mission expectation. These priorities could easily change a mission due to dynamic situations, altered missions, or actual hardware failures. A hardware failure could lead to loss of a high priority activity and loss of a mission despite the availability of other resources capable of performing the mission. A self-aware system could balance resources, efficiencies, and mission priorities to efficiently use system resources to dynamically and effectively meet mission requirements. This SBIR addresses these limitations by pursuing the development of self-aware processing systems that monitor their own condition and state, evaluate that condition and available resources, and respond by re-allocating resources to manage and optimize system performance.

In terms of war-related injuries, TBI is more frequent than amputation. Additionally, over one million civilians are treated for TBI in the United States every year; 5.3 million Americans are living with a TBI-related disability; and 17.9 million Americans have cognitive disabilities. Often, diagnosis may be complicated because of an interaction between TBI and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Even moderate TBI can cause personality changes, as well as serious problems with memory, attention, decision-making, self-awareness, and self-control. Our objective is to develop systems that enhance day-to-day control and effectiveness of people with TBI, providing compensatory functions where needed. These tools may combine a portable computing system with miniature sensors (e.g. small video camera, microphones, GPS) and cognitive software techniques that can make appropriate inferences. Based on the situation, state of the user and the user history, a user will be cued with appropriate information to assist with his actions or decisions in an optimal manner. A range of rehabilitation or restorative techniques to train brain-injured people to improve their ability to interact with real-time, real-world life situations may also be developed. This topic does not address research whose principal purpose is to further our understanding of brain function, but the systems envisioned might also collect data useful to researchers. This effort is enabled by continuing rapid progress in two technology areas. The first is the continued miniaturization of sensing and computing devices such as video cameras, audio recorders, global position systems (GPS) and inertial navigation devices, and computing platforms like personal digital assistants (PDAs). The second is the emergence of computer cognitive techniques for storing, indexing, and retrieving data from these sensors and techniques for interpreting sensor data, inferring additional information about the world, and modeling intentions and internal state. The systems envisioned by this topic span a broad spectrum of possible capabilities and realizations. The system may emphasize to varying degrees the prosthetic augmentation of patient capability, patient rehabilitation, relieving the burden on caregivers, real-time behavioral assessment, or long term measurement of progress. It may interact solely or principally with the patient, or with family, immediate caregivers, therapists, doctors, or researchers. Its realization may involve many different possible components, including different types of hardware (e.g., worn sensors, PDAs, laptops), software (e.g., cognitive software, knowledge bases), and other system-level elements (e.g., internet and other connectivity, database resources, web-based services).

Simulators used for military training have become increasingly realistic due to technological advancements. However, there is variability in the efficacy of these simulators due in large part to the degree to which they captivate and engage users. Furthermore, it isn’t clear how to distinguish those that are more effective from those that are less effective. In terms of education, waning interest in the pursuit of science and technology is weakening the U.S. in the face of growing international competition. Having the ability to generate entertaining video games that teach effectively would address both of these problems and serve a broad range of related interests as well. It is expected that the successful application of science and technology curricula to the video-gaming medium would result in tremendous gains in both learning quantity and efficacy by exploiting the significant time allocation and high content retention associated with the video-gaming medium. Furthermore, it is expected that the successful application of video-gaming to military training curricula would reduce training and improve field performance due to the rapid skill acquisition and other benefits associated with intrinsically-motivated learning (see Deci & Ryan). A system built upon gaming frameworks and novel analytic approaches could be developed to provide learning metrics that could be derived from undirected game play. Such a system could identify highly-effective instructional video games through an innovative statistical analysis of the high-volume game play data expected to accompany a high entertainment quotient. Of particular interest are approaches that encourage game submissions and permit games to compete for learning efficacy. One way to do this would be to develop or adapt a gaming framework (e.g., 3D Gamemaker, StageCast, etc.) that allows both programmers and non-programmers to develop gaming content. The games could be made available for public use and performance incentives (e.g., prizes for high scores) could be offered to promote participation. The framework would then track and analyze incremental learning across multiple players and games. In particular, multiple games would compete within the same topical domain. Using game score as an indicator of domain knowledge, games would be assessed by comparing pre and post-game performances on other games. Thus, the games themselves would provide a robust indicator of each other’s efficacy and associated retention. As new games were introduced and competed in the framework, some games would ""bubble up” as high-impact instructional vehicles, while others would naturally drop out of the fold. Thus, players would be competing with other players for high scores, and games would be competing with other games for learning efficacy. Games that result in fastest learning and highest player retention would be earmarked for pedagogic use. In general, any approaches or combination of approaches that support the stated objective are welcome.",470,3146,1,No,No,No,,"Investigate extensively the existing body of research in psychology and education to determine and support empirically the characteristics of a suitable gaming framework, focusing on motivation, engagement, and instructive value. Identify any existing frameworks that embody those characteristics. Define clearly the methodology and metrics that would be used to assess learning efficacy in Phase II.","Develop a prototype of the game development and assessment framework. Develop instructionally rich, engaging games and then assess game-specific learning efficacy by analyzing players’ performances across those games. Empirically demonstrate that the approach indeed selects for games with the highest learning value as suggested by the Phase I investigation.","The development of video game-based pedagogic tools that are as compelling as video games today could have a wide range of applications in both the federal and private sectors, including primary and secondary education, military training, corporate training, and self-improvement. In all cases, it is expected that learning time would be reduced, skill and content acquisition improved, and overall costs reduced.",1,"Stagecast, available online (2006): http://www.stagecast.com/creator.html; Paul, R.

This technology must examine the semantic structure and dynamic operation of the system, assist users in seeing not only how the system makes decisions, but what decisions it has made for a particular input configuration, and correlate the simulation results with real world data. The technology should support semi-automatic extraction of the meta model from the source code, and comparison and evaluation of the meta model with the designer’s model representation. Metrics assessing the ‘goodness of fit’ of the implementation to the model are required. Validation is the process of determining if the simulation produces results that correlate with real world events. It is usually achieved through calibration of the system and comparing simulation results to known real world data. For large scale simulations, it is impossible to test every input parameter scenario. Moreover, stochastic influences can yield an exponentially large set of alternatives at critical decision points. Tools are required to semi-automate the process of testing a system given its meta model. Working backwards from an output configuration, these tools should determine a test suite that provides the greatest coverage in testing the decision paths through the system and determine what input parameter configurations induce the greatest sensitivity in the output configurations. It is insufficient for a model to just predict a pattern of events or behaviors from its input; it must also explain how it derived this pattern. Validation of a simulation must be in terms of the sequence of decisions (and computations) that it made to arrive at the answer. Often, variations in predictions are dependent on second and third order effects. Output is derived from lengthy, complex chains of inferences and computations. Tools are required to assist users in visualizing these chains and the intermediate states that a system traverses to produce an output and to generate explanations (using meta models) that describe how the system achieved the resulting output configuration. Given real world event data, the tools should be able to ""walk back through” the model to determine what input configurations could generate those results, characterize the differences between the simulation’s results and the real world data, and assess the sensitivity of the simulation to variations in the input data configurations.",383,2534,1,No,No,No,,"The contractor shall develop novel approaches for (1) extracting a meta model from existing simulation code that is expressible in a formal representation to be used in automatically developing test suites, and (2) augmenting existing simulation code to visualize control and decision flow through the simulation.

The Army and Marine Corps are deployed to hundreds of countries around the world, in many cases in small units. These forces deployed at remote locations do not have access to simulation capabilities, either for training or mission planning or rehearsal. The goal is to address this deficit with a ""Simulation Center in a Box"". Responders need to propose a complete system, consisting of compact computing platforms, appropriate display and user input/output (I/O) solutions, communications, and software that can run a validated simulation system (such as the Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) or OneSAF Objective System) to simulate a battalion and an appropriately-sized opposing force that could fit into a case small enough to carry onto a commercial airliner. Operationally, the concept is that the simulation center operator (perhaps a single person) would arrive with the ""simulation center in a box,” set it up in a conference room, mess tent, or other facility, and be ready to conduct training within an hour. This does not include the time necessary to build the training scenario, which could be done in advance. The simulation chosen must support both ""conventional” warfare and the asymmetric warfare that characterizes much of the contemporary operating environment. The simulation must also interact with the battle command systems typically found at ground maneuver battalions: Maneuver Control System (MCS), All Source Analyis System (ASAS), Air Missile Defense Workstation (AMDWS), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), Future Battalion Command Brigade and Below/Blue Force Tracking (FBCB2/BFT), and Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC). (Time needed to reconfigure battle command systems is also not included in the desired ""one hour” setup time, but bidders must show how they would estimate the time needed to do so and how their solution would minimize that time.) Finally, the simulation chosen must minimize the number of operators (""pucksters"") needed to operate the simulation once deployed. While development of the training scenario could be done in advance, the desire is for the ""simulation center in a box” to be capable of beginning training within one hour of arrival. As a result, DARPA envisions that the system will use commercial wireless networking capabilities to link the devices. The study must address the security implications. Besides the primary training function, the ""simulation center in a box” must include support for evaluating the training exercise, including training logs, transcripts, after-action reports, and other appropriate take-away material. In addition, evaluation information should be complete enough to provide feedback to improve the exercise and training scenario itself.

A technology gap exists between this data, usually displayed as raw feeds from each ISR system, and a coherent visual interpretation of the combat situation. The human brain is well adapted to combining and filtering the signals from multiple sensory modalities, and emerging evidence from neuroscience suggests this ability may originate from the hierarchical architecture in the frontal cortex [1]. DARPA is interested in the application of hierarchical architectures to situation awareness, as a means of visualizing the content from multiple, heterogeneous battlefield ISR assets. It is envisioned that Hierarchical Situation Visualization (HSV) technology will process the data from multiple feeds to dynamically route and/or aggregate content to the appropriate staff in the chain of command. For example, HSV use the same sensor data to display events at the tactical level (e.g., platoon moving north) at multiple locations as well as events at an operational level (e.g., company retreating), and strategic level (e.g., enemy consolidating control). HSV will present these interactive operational pictures adapted to the user’s objectives and command responsibilities (e.g., company, battalion, brigade) and be sensitive to low-level surprises that warrant high-level attention. Alternative human computer interaction modalities (e.g., immersive environments, virtual reality, haptics) are of interest for this effort. Proposers are encouraged to employ operationally realistic agent based combat model simulations (e.g., Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF), air warfare simulation model (AWSIM)) for design and development of HSV technology.

Current technologies have advanced the processing power and communications range of devices such that a network may consist of a large number of nodes (possibly hundreds of thousands) deployed over a large area (possibly tens of square miles). Such deployments support operations such as wide-area surveillance, tracking of activity, and the detection and classification of assets. An accurate method of determining each node’s precise location within the network significantly improves the value of the data collected by the sensor network. This capability supports an ad-hoc deployment of nodes (eliminating the need to deploy nodes to precisely known locations) and reduces the need to ""touch” each node once deployed. One approach to localizing a network of sensors makes use of controllable light sources and the image measurements derived from embedded smart camera systems. This approach allows the network to determine the relative positions and orientations of the smart camera nodes as well as the locations of other sensor nodes in the ensemble. This effort would involve the development of methods to estimate the relative position and orientation of a constellation of sensors based on optical measurements.",204,1346,1,No,No,No,,Conduct a feasibility study on optical localization techniques.

The simplest of gauges map physical measurements into human-accessible categories, like ""speed,” ""temperature,” ""RPM”, etc. In more complex sensor-processing, like automatic image analysis, the challenge of converting the many low-level bits of information into just a few user-relevant categories is greater. State-of-the-art systems are typically engineered to effectively solve narrow and relatively rigid instances of this problem in an application -specified fashion. When existing categories are insufficient and need to be extended, refined, or redefined, the situation must first be identified by people, usually end users or our warfighters, and then resolved by engineers in a process that can take months or even years. In adversarial situations, when opponents are actively seeking to modify and disguise the signatures of their equipment, the ability to recognize novel patterns in sensor data and reason about the cause and threat potential can be a decisive advantage. As the number and type of sensors continues to grow, so does the need for adaptive algorithms that can learn the appropriate categories and categorical distinctions required by the end users and applications. This is a feature of higher-order intelligence that is essentially human: people can naturally extend, refine, and adapt their vocabularies with seemingly little cognitive difficulty. It has long been believed (e.g., [1][2][6]) that human-level intelligence such as this can be viewed as the product of an integrated suite of lower-level competencies, many of which embody some information-processing capability generally considered ""intelligent” in its own right. This topic seeks innovative research proposals that will build upon emerging software-integration frameworks and recent advances in cognitive engineering to integrate a variety of state-of-the-art intelligent competencies in ways that directly address the sensor-to-symbol problem. Potentially relevant examples of integration frameworks include service-oriented architectures, grid computing, agent-oriented architectures, and semantic integration. Cognitive architectures have been the focus of DARPA’s Architectures for Cognitive Information Processing (ACIP) program and there are a number of existing architectures that could plausibly serve as a baseline for integrating intelligent competencies in order to produce higher-order intelligence. References [3][4] and [5] each describe very different examples of such architectures. The ideal proposal will seek to build upon existing frameworks to combine a variety of extant capabilities in order to address the fundamental sensor-to-symbol problem in a significant way, while also demonstrating the general-purpose nature of the approach to integration. As a hypothetical example, a thermal-imagery based sensor processing system could be capable of classifying various vehicle signatures. Assuming that it classified Humvees as friendly military vehicles, such a system may be confused by the altered signature presented by Hummers in civilian areas. A symbolic reasoner might be able to first note the discrepancy, then assess the possible explanations, potentially in a dialog with users, and then apply standard machine-learning techniques in an attempt to produce an accurate assessment of a Hummer as a civilian vehicle. If guerilla forces then begin to use Hummers for troop movements, the system might be able to use information about geo-location, the structure of convoys, and common operating knowledge to produce an updated discrimination between the non-threatening use of Hummers and potential adversarial uses. This effort will create a foundation for the construction of robust, user-centric sensor-processing systems that integrate large and diverse sets of advanced information-processing capabilities.",561,4000,1,No,No,No,,"Assess feasibility of proposed technical approach by identifying key technical barriers, evaluating alternative solutions, and developing strategies to mitigate risk.

It will drastically reduce the cost and implementation time of changes in a sensor classification scheme. In an increasingly sensor-laden world, this could create significant flexibility in a wide variety of embedded applications that can not currently be modified or updated without significant costs.

The ability to scan the imaging sensor enables significant reduction in the size of the optics. Furthermore, enhancement to system resolution is possible if the scanner has the capability to zoom in on the target or region of interest. Furthermore, reductions in cooling power requirements of a large FPA (to enhance sensitivity) could be made if one could scan the array. This is important for small platform applications such as, micro-air vehicles, robots, and ""motes” (short for remote sensors that are connected via wireless transceiver.). Currently, scanning and zooming of imaging optics is done with bulky mechanical gimbals or using multiple focal plane arrays and associated optics to cover the wide field of view. These approaches are not only expensive in terms of power, size and weight, but also costly. Future military imaging systems need micro-actuators to perform functions such as tip, tilt, and zoom. This requires moving small mechanical loads such as mirrors or lenses and detector arrays.

A majority of that increase occurred between 1960 and 1980, when the inlet temperature grew at a rate of 55°F per year, yielding an 1100°F increase in turbine temperature during that span. Since that time, temperature increases have asymptoted to <5°F per year. This is of great significance because the inlet temperature for turbine engines directly relates to performance (specific power) and efficiency. Improved turbine blade thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) could increase specific power and reduce fuel and cost-of-ownership by billions of dollars. Current efforts on improving TBCs are based on ceramic spray coatings and advanced cooling of the turbine blades. The current methods focus on micron-scale thin film engineering, while it is clear that layer-by-layer nanoscale deposition of layers to form nano-layer composites may offer significant advantages. In addition, NEMS/MEMS engineered coatings could be engineered for different engine performance needs. The co-development of nano-composite films in addition to NEMS thermal isolation techniques will significantly increase inlet temperature of turbines by reducing thermal conductivity with minimal impact on overall weight of the turbine blade. NEMS/MEMS coatings can enable photon flux control, and can also control phonon flux using nano and micro scale thermal isolation structures.

However, as the needed resolution decreases with each manufacturing generation, new light sources, materials and methods need to be developed. Current research to improve the resolution of optical lithographic techniques have centered on immersion lithography which is limited by the lowest refractive index of the components of the system including the final lens, the immersion fluid, and the photoresist. Improvements above the current state of the art are challenging. In addition, phase shift masks and optical proximity corrections are needed to correct for diffraction effects to further improve the resolution, but these are quite complex and require extended processing time.

Recently the use of a negative index material (a material with negative permittivity and susceptibility) has been shown to exhibit 60 nm half-pitch resolution using 365 nm light without the use of optical correction techniques. These materials focus, rather than diffract, the light due to their negative refraction of light.

It is not feasible to deploy such systems on mobile platforms, such as trucks, tanks, unmanned autonomous vehicles and planes, the dimensions of which are typically smaller than the wavelength of interest, particularly at the low end of the HF band. The objective of this topic is to explore and demonstrate the use of cryogenically cooled superconductive Josephson junction technology (capable of operating at temperatures in the vicinity of 77 K) in the fabrication of physically small antennas with dimensions of the order of several inches or less (excluding the cryogenic enclosure)) that are capable of environmental noise limited reception in the band of interest, that can detect weak signals in the presence of very intense interfering signals, both in band and out of band, with the objective of demonstrating a dynamic range of the order of or greater than 140 dB per Hertz and that can perform direction finding on weak signals to an accuracy of several degrees or less. Previous research activities have demonstrated that environmentally noise limited detection can be achieved using superconducting loop antennas, with areas of several square centimeters, when superconducting amplifiers employing Josephson junctions have been used to detect the signal induced in the loop antenna by the incident radiation. A variety of Josephson junction based amplifier configurations have been examined including single Superconducting Quantum Interference devices (SQUIDs) (a superconducting circuit containing two Josephson junctions), series arrays of SQUIDs, series-parallel arrays of SQUIDs, (commonly known as Superconducting Quantum Interference Filters (SQIF), a superconducting parametric up-converter amplifier employing a large number of SQUID inductively coupled to a superconducting transmission line, and a long Josephson junction (known as a Josephson Fluxon Anti-Fluxon Transistor (JFAT)). All of these configurations for Josephson junction amplifiers exhibit gain and exceptionally low front-end noise over various frequency bands from DC to greater than 20 GHz. However, there has been only very limited research (except for the case of an amplifier employing a single SQUID) on the dynamic range and Spur Free Dynamic Range of these Josephson junction based amplifiers. This latter research is crucial for the use of Josephson junction based amplifiers in dense noise environments. Furthermore, these superconductive loop antenna systems have not been configured for performing direction finding on a very short base line. The ultimate objective is to fabricate and evaluate, as a function of array complexity, various Josephson junction-based amplifier configurations for HF DF applications in dense environments and to down select the configurations which are deemed to be most promising for more detailed evaluation in a simulated operational environment.",478,3191,1,No,No,No,,"The Phase I effort should involve the compilation of the reported characteristics of various Josephson junction-based amplifier configurations (that are capable of operating at temperatures in the vicinity of 77 K), which might be suitable for HF DF applications.

This would establish the proper scaling laws for the amplifier response in terms of gain, noise, single tone dynamic range and Spur Free Dynamic Range. In this Phase, detailed test plans shall be prepared for full evaluation of these devices, both in the laboratory and then in a simulated operational situation at an outdoor test range.","In Phase II, mask sets will be designed and chips fabricated to evaluate and characterize the selected amplifier configuration as a function of complexity to optimize reception sensitivity, gain, single tone dynamic range, and Spur Free Dynamic Range. The devices with the most desirable characteristics shall be mounted on a closed cycle cryogenic refrigerator (capable of providing temperatures near 77 K), thoroughly tested in the laboratory, and, then, at an outdoor test range. In all cases, the performance of the superconductive antenna will be compared to a reference antenna (of the same size) and amplifier combination (using the current conventional, room temperature technologies) and evaluated in a simulated dense noise environment to verify the capability of the superconductive antenna to detect very weak signals in the presence of intense interfering signals, both in band and out of band. A very compact, co-located array of magnetic sensing coils and associated superconductive amplifiers are to be configured and tested to demonstrate and quantify the direction finding capability for extremely small, co-located superconducting antennas.

Edward R. Tufte in particular has documented case studies [1] providing evidence that the ""cognitive style” of modern software such as PowerPoint™ tends to ""reduce the analytic quality of serious presentations of evidence”. Yet the conventions that such software supports are in widespread use, potentially serving as a root cause of systemic underperformance in organizations that depend heavily on the rapid and accurate communication of complex concepts. The consequences of poor idea representation and inaccurate idea transfer are serious in the armed forces as well as diplomatic and commercial realms. Therefore, this solicitation invites proposals for a system that will revolutionize the creation and presentations of briefings to more rapidly and accurately transfer ideas, plans, and high-quality analyses from human mind to human mind. There are many research questions associated with developing the platonic ideal of presentation software such as PowerPoint. Can a user-friendly author’s interface simplify the mechanics of briefing construction? What conventions and abstractions should be embodied in software to help authors refine their thinking and maximize the analytic quality of briefings? What makes a briefing effective and easy to understand, and can information design techniques help to balance the tension between analytic quality and ease of audience understanding? In what form and at what rate should ideas be elaborated for maximum understanding and retention by an audience? What real-time interactions should be supported as the briefing progresses: should the briefer control the audience’s attention or vice-versa? Should briefings even be ""presented”, or should they be considered a novel medium with the nature of an interactive visual essay that is simply ""used” by the audience? What are the differences between briefing a single person and briefing multiple people who must all absorb and act in concert on a complex idea? New answers to such questions will lead to novel system designs. Modern technology including computation, networking, visualization and animation, and perhaps even augmented cognition all provide untapped realms for briefing software and hardware that have a potential to go ""beyond PowerPoint” in surprising and effective ways. Proposers are expected to describe a research project with the potential for dramatically improving upon state of the art approaches for creating and absorbing complex ideas, plans, and high-quality analyses. The novel insights behind the proposed concept (based on information design, cognitive psychology, etc) must be clear. A basis of confidence in the proposed idea should be clear. A plan for evaluating the efficacy of the proposed solution relative to the state of the art (PowerPoint) must be articulated. The evaluation should balance factors such as time-to-create a briefing with factors such as the audience’s ability to accurately absorb and retain the briefing. If possible, the evaluation factors should also assess the extent to which the briefing software improves the analytic quality and intellectual rigor of the briefing author’s ideas. Proposers should strive for generality wherever possible, although it is recognized that in early stages of R&D the system may be most usefully explored in a narrow context (military planning, daily briefings, etc). In addition, proposers should not be overly constrained by the limitations of widely-deployed software and hardware, yet the SBIR project should lead to a practically deployable system within the 3-5 year timeframe.",549,3707,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I must result in a feasibility study of novel concepts in information design that have a potential to be embodied in software and hardware.

The first objective is to develop a meaningful symbology and visual depiction of information operations concepts for the broadest definition of information operations (ranging from psychological operations to network operations). The second objective is to use this symbology to develop a digital information operations picture (DICOP) display system that is analogous to, and integrated, with geographic and kinetic common operation pictures. Great strides have been made in digitizing the battlefield and developing standardized sets of representations for the commander to visualize the battlefield. However, within this domain, certain challenges exist when dealing with different specializations. For example, a red icon means different things to an infantry officer (interpretation: enemy entity; action: destroy) than to a signal officer (interpretation: asset is disabled, action: fix it). The area of information operations is lacking in visualization support. A succinct and information-rich representation of relatively fluid and qualitative concepts is needed to appropriately map out and assess progress during an information operations campaign and to understand how that operation impacts tactical operations and vice versa. Another challenge is that information operations tend to span areas that are not geographically contiguous. Further this representation should be incorporated into the tactical picture to best assess overall impact and progress. For example, it may be important to map out areas of support from local populations vs. areas populated by adversaries, or to visualize social and communication networks that may or may not correspond to geographical features. These types of impacts will require the commander to understand issues and impacts that may be well outside the defined area of responsibility but have significant consequences to the success (or failure) of a mission. The technical challenges in developing a meaningful operating picture of information operations are substantial. Key factors include translating traditionally subjective and qualitative concepts from human psychology, culture, and sociology to quantitative representations that support the military decision making process and can be incorporated into the digital tactical picture.",329,2338,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I must result in a feasibility study of novel concepts in information design that have a potential to be embodied in software and hardware. Proposers should plan to develop a meaningful symbology of information operations to represent key qualitative concepts. Breakthroughs in terrorism, social networking, and behavioral studies may lead the way to best visually represent information. In parallel, proposers should investigate how to visualize and manipulate information operations data in a fieldable software/hardware system.",This stage must result in a proof-of-principle prototype implementation and demonstration and must engage potential customers to increase the likelihood of successful transition. Proposers should plan to identify transition paths that take into account state-of-the-art systems such as Command Post of the Future.,"This technology has potential commercial utility in marketing, advertising, and social networking. With respect to computer network operations there may be analogies to disaster recovery management where the interconnected nature of data, power, and transportation networks must be related to physical disasters such as transformer overloads or hurricanes. Network management applications for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or telecommunication companies are also natural analogues of computer network operations.

Applications include riflescopes, spotter scopes, imaging for missiles, UAV based overhead surveillance, land based surveillance for unattended sensors/motes (remote sensors) and robotics as well as laser pointing and designating. Today this is done by moving bulky lenses mechanically. An alternative is to use fluidic lenses; however the operating range of wavelengths is very limited. Development of a reflective flexible membrane would satisfy the military need to develop an optical zoom and auto-focus capability from visible wavelengths to far IR. This capability promises to have a revolutionary impact on future military optical systems in providing rapid, multiple optical foveation and zoom capability with Wide Field of View (WFOV) with substantially lower weight, volume, and power, and have no moving parts. Several approaches may be devised to produce a reflective membrane which is capable of > 50% flexure and which spans the visible to IR wavelengths (0.4 to 5 ƒÝm) and has an aperture in the 1mm-1cm range. Innovative approaches are sought to be able to achieve coating, embedding or sandwiching of the reflective layer in the flexible membrane. The key issue will be how to avoid the composite reflective membrane from de-lamination, rupturing, or bunching during cycling and thermal excursion in the military temperature range. The optical properties, morphology, and shape of the reflecting surface are also important to maintain low loss as well as not to introduce severe optical aberrations as the surface flexes.

Increased bandwidth is more easily realized at a higher carrier frequency. Further increases are limited by poor propagation through the atmosphere and other transmission media. The relationship between minimum signal bandwidth and sampling rate is classically expressed as bandwidth is less than or equal to 1 / delta-t. The spread in bandwidth may be interpreted as an uncertainty in the energy of a single photon, and the sampling interval may be interpreted as the uncertainty in the timing of that photon. The inverse relationship between these quantities is expressed in the Uncertainty Principle (U.P.): delta-E times delta-t is greater than or equal to h/(2pi). The U.P. applies to a single quantum state, which may entangle multiple photons. With an appropriate detection protocol, delta-E applies to the sum of all N photons in a single entangled state even though the photons may propagate as a group of N low energy photons. These N photons have low-frequency propagation benefits yet achieve the bandwidth (data rate) classically associated with use of photons N times greater in energy. For application in free-space communications, the quantum state used must be robust to typical propagation characteristics such as dispersion and attenuation. The quantum state selected during Phase I should be robust to a radiation pattern that is non-uniformly spread of 4pi steradians and has greater than 10 dB absorption in the transmission medium. The system concept selected during Phase I should be robust to thermal noise from the environment and receiver at 290K. The scope of this R&D does not include development of any hardware components such as entangled sources or detectors. Communications schemes open for study under this analytical effort are not limited by availability or maturity of hardware.

Deployable payloads include surveillance and listening devices, tagging devices and other packages.

For a solar-powered extreme HALE ""stepping-stone” version of this aircraft with multi-month endurance, one key technology need is the ability to reduce the structural mass fraction while maintaining the performance and reliability. At these extreme altitudes (90-100 kft), the potential wing loading will be 0.6-0.7 lbs/sqft and weight budgets for all aspects of the craft will be particularly challenging. Unfortunately for the structural design, it is difficult to evaluate the potential maximum loads given the stochastic nature of the wind and gust environment, during both the launch and recovery phases, as well as during the time on station. These loads lead to the most troubling instability, i.e. buckling. Designing to the 99.99% load in the traditional manner is not an option because the structural mass fraction would become much too large. Therefore, new design approaches will be needed. A number of potential approaches can be envisioned. These include independent, distributed control along the length of the wing to counteract the natural response of a flexible wing structure to pre-load the center section (as was seen with NASA’s Helios).

Unfortunately, the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation used in fiber networks, and consequently the photonic device size, is approximately one hundred times larger than typical electronic components. Increasing the electromagnetic frequency to reduce the wavelength would lead to the need for X-ray waveguides, sources, and switches. The other approach is to stay at optical frequencies but use high index dielectrics to shrink the wavelength by a factor proportional to the index of refraction. Unfortunately the latter approach can only provide a wavelength reduction of five or less. A surface plasmon is a collective oscillation of electrons at the surface of a metal[1]. These surface waves oscillate at optical frequencies and propagate along the surface of the metal. The wavelength of a surface plasmon can be very small and comparable to the dimensions of electronic circuits. In addition, the plasmons are tightly confined to the surface with transverse decay lengths on the order of the skin depth, 10 nm. Plasmonic waveguides[2], while lossy compared with optical fibers, only need to carry information several centimeters across a chip. Thus, plasmonics is expected to be the bridge that links electronics with photonics[3-5]. It has recently been proposed that electromagnetic radiation at optical frequencies can be focused to a spot size of only 5 nm through the use of surface plasmons[6]. This extremely tight confinement of electromagnetic waves provides opportunities to fabricate photonic devices with sizes comparable to state of the art electronic devices. In accompaniment with the small volume will be large field strengths and high intensities but at very low energies. These are the ideal conditions for third order nonlinear optical devices that will have very low switching threshold energies and fast response times. Second order nonlinear optical devices for harmonic generation, etc., will also benefit from the features inherent in plasmonic devices.

THz sources in the 0.1-1.0 THz region, though comparatively weak, have matured dramatically in recent years and are now commercially available. Atmospheric line broadening, attenuation, and fluctuations, however, remain as hurdles. Recently, a new methodology for performing stand-off agent detection has been proposed.[1] This technique overcomes the inherent limitations of atmospheric THz attenuation by exciting the agent cloud with a high power, mode-locked TEA CO2 laser.[2] The technique overcomes the limitations of line broadening because the laser pulses induce a brief terahertz transient absorption or emission, unique to the analyte interrogated, which may be observed with a THz transceiver. The CO2 laser is relatively unattenuated by the atmosphere, dramatically lowering the THz power requirements for the THz transceiver.

In both applications, development of more powerful laser sources (and increasingly sensitive detectors) has been required for practical fieldable systems to be contemplated. Femtosecond laser pulses are commonly generated at UV wavelengths by frequency-converting near infrared (IR) femtosecond pulses from Ti:sapphire lasers using nonlinear optical techniques. The pulse width of a UV laser beam generated in this fashion is comparable to that of the original near IR beam (~100 fs). However, because different chemical and biological processes occur on various sub-nanosecond time scales, it is of interest to probe these systems with laser pulses of adjustable width. Variation of laser pulse width also allows for very predictable changes in peak power delivered to targets such as sensor arrays. Femtosecond pulses are routinely expanded to several tens or hundreds picoseconds for the purpose of chirped pulse amplification; however, in addition to being chirped, the pulses exit such pulse stretchers with very specific pulse widths suitable for specific types of amplification. More flexibility is afforded by dispersion-free pulse shaping schemes wherein a femtosecond pulse of arbitrary shape can be generated using gratings in conjunction with lithographic masks [1], liquid crystal modulators [2-3], acousto-optic modulators [4], and deformable mirrors [5]. Pulse shapers have historically been used primarily to create novel pulses and pulse trains still characterized by sub-picosecond pulse widths, whereas the interest here is keeping the pulse shape simple (for example, square) but adjusting the pulse width over several orders of magnitude. To address potential military applications in the ultraviolet, the pulse expander should at least span the tuning range of a (customer provided) frequency doubled Ti:Sapphire laser (350-450 nm), and preference will be given to solutions that go farther into the UV. The primary requirement of the expander will be to generate a stable, minimally chirped output pulse of adjustable width from 100 fs to at least 1 ns. The expander should be able to accommodate UV pulse fluences from nJ to ~100 uJ energy. Attention should be paid to minimizing the insertion and operational loss of the pulse expander (e.g. by modulating the phase rather than the amplitude of the spectrally dispersed pulse) while minimizing induced pulse-to-pulse width and amplitude variability so that pulse fluence and stability is maintained as much as possible from input through the expander. Finally, the qualitative temporal shape of the pulse should remain approximately square over the pulse width tuning range.

The primary design driver is to minimize mass but often at the expense of time and money. This design driver is maintained throughout the design of the entire spacecraft. A secondary design driver is system reliability. Since spacecrafts are expensive, complex, and nearly impossible to repair once on orbit, system reliability is also important. As a result of these two constraints, every aspect of the system’s design must be carefully considered, analyzed, and tested. The results are a specialized point design for each mission and a long and arduous design process. Currently, the design, integration, and testing of the thermal control system (TCS) requires years to complete and is a leading contributor to satellite development time. The design time for an average small satellite is one to three years. Due to the long design cycle time and the rapid evolution of technology, satellites are obsolete before they are even launched.

Adapt to a wide range of component sizes, locations, heat loads, and operating temperatures. 3. Switch between high conductance and low conductance states as dictated by the components. 4.

Small engines (10 HP and below) which are the focus of this topic have not been as extensively developed and optimized, and present design challenges for high performance Defense applications. Hybrid electric propulsion systems (7) are attractive at power levels of interest in this topic, where the engine can be optimized for ‘cruise conditions’ and battery power can be used for peak power requirements to optimize system performance. Electric power consumption for sensors and communication is also provided by a hybrid electric system. Innovation is required to develop small engines with high performance as described in this topic. There are a large variety of engine types that could in principle be adapted such that they meet topic goals for power density (> 1 HP/lb.), efficiency (>25%) and quiet operation. Each engine type has its own design specific advantages and challenges. Internal combustion (IC) engines are usually simple 2 stroke engines in this power range with exhaust ports instead of valves. Designs for a small 4 or more stroke engine with enhanced performance will need to address the problems associated with valve actuation at high rpm. IC engine may require 4 or more cylinders for reduced acoustic signatures desired and this would increase thermal losses while also increasing friction in the engine. Turboelectric designs at small size scale also present design challenges including stabilizing the combustion and dealing with thermal losses. Rotary engines are also a design option with seal wear and friction being just one problem to overcome. Meeting topic goals may require innovation in both materials of construction as well as design. Higher operating temperatures may be required to increase engine efficiency requiring higher temperature capable materials.

The military utility of helicopters is currently limited by high maintenance costs and vulnerability to small arms fire while landing in hostile territory. The power plant of choice for helicopters is a gas turbine engine due to its high power density. However, the high shaft rpm of a turboprop gas turbine requires a large transmission which may weigh more than the engine due to the much lower rpm rotor which provides lift to the helicopter. If the transmission can be replaced with a motor-generator pair, many of the high maintenance components in the drive train can be eliminated, resulting in reduced operation and support cost comparable to fixed wing aircraft. A hybrid electric drive would also allow the use of a larger number of smaller rotors or electric driven ducted fans, and even the elimination of the tail rotor, which would reduce vulnerability to small arms through redundant systems. One obstacle to hybrid electric motors is the relative low power density of available electric motors. Commercial off the shelf electric motors have been designed for high efficiency, but power densities are low (~0.1 Horse Power per pound, HP/lb). Electric motors developed for aircraft propulsion have power densities between 1 and 2 HP/lb. Power density of electric motors/generators increase with the operating speed and so direct drive generators can have extremely high power densities (greater than 5 HP/lb). The challenging problem for this topic is to design and prototype a 7 HP electric motor with a power density greater than 5 HP/lb, efficiency greater than 95% and an operating RPM of less than 10,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). The electric motor produced would be useful for powering a ducted fan (less than 12 inches in diameter) and capable of producing a high thrust to weight for small vertical takeoff and landing UAVs. These goals are intended to push the state of the art in high energy density electric motors. It is anticipated that innovation in both design and materials will be needed to meet these goals. High energy product magnetic materials will be useful in shrinking the size of the motor. Ring motors may be particularly suitable for ducted fans although novel designs using a central shaft may also be appropriate.",393,2420,1,No,No,No,,Feasibility study to show that the innovative approach in the design of the motor meets or exceeds program goals taking into account the mechanical and electrical aspects of the design.,"Refine the design from phase I and build a prototype ducted fan and electric motor meeting the program goals (7 HP, 8,400 RPM, greater than 5HP/lb, and efficiency greater than 95%).",Electric motors with power densities greater than 5 HP/lb will enable vertical takeoff and landing aircraft with operational and support costs similar to fixed wing aircraft. Commercial applications include short haul air transportation and emergency air vehicles for evacuation of accident victims. The use of the electric motors in lift fans within wings offer the potential for longer range air transport. Higher power density motors also have applications in reducing the weight of consumer products with electric motors such as vacuum cleaners.,1,"Jeffrey J. Berton, Joshua E. Freeh, and Timothy J.

One of the major hurdles to deployment of reliable and functional biological sensor instruments is simplification of rapid, reliable and consistent sample collection and preparation [1, 2]. Several factors make ""in the field” sample collection difficult. First, there is currently no single sample method that is universally applicable to many sample sources. Additionally, in a deployed situation, a sterile working environment is not available, so contaminants are often present in the sample being processed. Finally, sample preparation protocols are often complex and difficult to perform for untrained users. In military situations, deploying scientifically trained personnel to every location that sampling needs to be performed is not possible. The need for a simple, near universal system for biological sample preparation in both military and civilian arenas is clear. This SBIR solicits development of an easy-to-use, deployable, reliable sample preparation method for nucleic acids that rapidly generates a sample ready for use in a wide variety of diagnostic equipment. The sample preparation system should be entirely self-contained, and allow rapid sample preparation from a wide range of input materials. Ultimately, this SBIR seeks to develop a product for sample generation that will enable the end user to perform a minimal procedure to prepare the sample in a sample device that will be directly attached to the biological detector for assaying.",241,1618,1,No,No,No,,Feasibility study of a method of nucleic acid preparation.

Traditionally, radiation protection for these individuals has been virtually non-existent, or consisted of shields created from lead and other heavy, dense metals. More recently, new material substances have been developed to replace lead in this role [1]. These new material substances are most often integrated into garments as protective sheets or layers of polymer that add protective properties to a garment [2]. In all cases, incorporating protective properties into a garment has a negative effect on the wearability or utility of the garment. When lead is incorporated, the garment becomes heavy, retains heat and moisture, and becomes inflexible. When other materials are incorporated as polymer layers, the garments retain heat and moisture, become thicker than normal garments, and tears or holes in the protective layer may not be visible as the garment is multilayered. Additionally, in the case of both new materials and lead, exposure to the radiation-blocking material itself may prove hazardous to the wearer, should the fabric of the garment tear and the wearer become directly exposed to the material. In most cases, the costs of garments integrating the newly developed radiation-blocking materials are very high, making them impractical for widespread use in military, medical, or first-responder settings. Many scenarios of terrorist attack in civilian and military theatres predict the usage of radiation dispersal devices (RDDs), or conventional explosives used as a method for disseminating radioactive material, which is typically described as a ""dirty bomb”. In any scenario involving a dirty bomb or RDD, first-responders and military personnel would likely be exposed to radiation in both the response/rescue stage of the attack, and also in the decontamination stage of the attack aftermath [3]. The currently available and previously described garments are not suitable for the needs of either group in this situation. This SBIR seeks development of novel fabrics or materials useful for radiation shielding in military and civilian settings. The developed fabrics or materials should be equivalent to or better than currently available radiation shielding technologies in areas of radiation attenuation, comfort for wearer, flexibility, and durability. Importantly, developed fabrics or materials must also be cost-effective, to enable widespread military and civilian usage in radioprotective garments.",376,2550,1,No,No,No,,"Determine the feasibility for the development of radiation blocking fabric including developing a cost-effective fabric that is equivalent to or better than current commercially available fabrics (Demron, Xenolite) for radiation attenuation in the Cs-137 emission range.

Demonstrate in Phase II the fabrication and function of complementary TFT circuits constructed primarily from SWCNT materials using printing techniques.,"Printed integrated circuits today are based upon organic materials (polymers and small molecules) that limit the performance and applicability of the resulting circuits. In particular, these organic materials have low carrier mobilities (~10-2 cm2/V/sec in P3HT) and few choices for n-type materials, yielding TFTs useful only in low-speed, low-density applications like displays and Radio Frequency Identification (RFIDs). These materials also suffer generally from substantial performance degradation when exposed to ambient environments. Fabrication is difficult owing to the integration of numerous heterogeneous materials with different fabrication constraints. Fabrication of complementary devices is extremely difficult (and not practiced commercially), greatly increasing the power requirement and complexity of the PIC in a given application. Recent advances in SWCNT materials suggest a means to radically improve PICs by using printed TFTs constructed primarily from SWCNT materials. It is well-established that SWCNTs have electronic structure tied to the chirality of the graphene sheet of which they are comprised. Depending on the chirality, SWCNT can be either semiconducting with extremely high carrier mobilities (>1000 cm2/V/sec) or metallic with very low resistivity (< 1 ¥ì§Ù-cm). These properties are orders of magnitude better than current printed electronic materials and rival those of Si-CMOS devices. Further, it has been shown that the electrical properties on SWCNTs are highly sensitive to chemical functionalization making them attractive transduction elements in a variety of sensing applications. SWCNT are extremely robust in high temperature, high humidity environments and it is reasonable to suppose that the processes for printing SWCNT materials will be compatible with a variety of common printing techniques (commercial dispersions of SWCNT are available). A major difficulty, however, in the fabrication of SWCNT thin film electronics, however, has been the inability to access SWCNT materials with a narrow distribution of chirality and size (and corresponding electronic properties). All SWCNT fabrication processes known today create complex mixtures of materials of different chirality and their separation after fabrication has been difficult. A variety of separation techniques are now in development including a recently published selective etching and centrifugation techniques. Another challenge is the control of majority carrier type and doping within the semiconducting SWCNT. Both n-type and p-type devices are needed to create complementary devices. It has been recently demonstrated that surface functionalization techniques can be used to control the majority carrier type. Further, it is necessary to identify materials and processes to use as gate insulators. As compared to some other efforts to create transistors using SWCNT that emphasize nanometer scale devices that might compete with Si CMOS, this effort emphasizes technologies that will dramatically improve the state of the art in printed electronics and, thereby, open new application opportunities in areas such as distributed, multifunctional sensors, medical diagnostics, structurally embedded/integrated electronics, rapid IC prototyping, and environmentally hardened electronics.",457,3305,1,No,No,No,,"Prepare a feasibility study of printed integrated circuits (PIC) based on thin film transistors (TFT) constructed of semiconducting SWCNT material for the semiconducting channels, metallic SWCNT for the metallic contacts and interconnects, and polymeric gate insulators.

In addition the device must be capable of withstanding exposure to common contaminants such as sand, dust, salt water, and oil. Although there are short distance wireless interface protocols for connecting a wide array of devices the transmission medium is almost exclusively air.

In addition to the losses due to spread, they also experience absorptive losses. The losses experienced when transmitting radio signals through water are significantly increased as compared to the losses in air. The losses are frequency dependent and they increase in direct proportion to the increase in frequency. Underwater communication systems typically employ the VLF or LF bands to minimize the absorptive losses over distance but the use of low frequency severely limits the data transmission bandwidth.

By providing the atomic physics community with more powerful and stable laser sources at the alkali wavelengths, this program seeks to accelerate deployment of atom-based sensors. The recent development of laser cooling and trapping has brought forth a new paradigm in precision metrology. Cold atom-based systems have already demonstrated unprecedented capabilities for timekeeping (2), inertial sensing (3), and magnetometry (4). These first-generation sensors are laboratory-scale and require the care of highly-trained specialists to operate. In order to realize their full potential, atom-based sensors must be brought outside of the benign, controlled laboratory environment. To this end, several DARPA programs seek to miniaturize and ruggedize atom-based sensors for deployment in the field. A key component of cold atom-based sensors is the lasers used for cooling, trapping, and probing the atomic species. Any attempt to build a robust atom sensor necessarily requires a major engineering effort to construct a compact, stable laser system. The use of distributed feedback (DFB) laser diodes provides an excellent approach for achieving the requisite operating conditions.

The waveforms require long dwells over a wide bandwidth affecting the surveillance system’s area coverage rate. To achieve such fine resolutions, these radars often overlap the frequencies being used by other co-band radars, and can even broadcast beyond the portions of the spectrum allocated for radars. As a result, it is often required to notch portions of the radar signal spectrum to avoid interfering with other systems or to avoid being jammed by high-power co-band signals. A consequence of the notching is that the peak range sidelobes and multiplicative noise ratio (MNR) can become very high, and can greatly diminish the quality of the SAR image.

Objects of interest include buildings, structures, functional areas and vehicles.","Existing methods for object classification rely primarily on static information available in single-frame images. However, analysts are highly interested in object functionality or purpose as this can provide a further level of classification. Video, and particularly persistent surveillance video, enables the determination of object type or function that would be difficult or impossible in static images. Many challenges exist in automatic functional classification, such as handling errors in moving object detection and tracking, large intra-class variability in the activity involving static structures, and large amounts of clutter traffic in urban areas. DARPA is seeking to develop automatic methods that take advantage of persistent video to identify the type, functionality, purpose and/or intent of both moving and static objects. The specific type of static objects such as buildings can be determined by characterizing the activity around them, such as dismounts entering and exiting and nearby vehicular traffic. Examples include terrorist safe houses, warehouses and weapon caches. The type and/or purpose of moving objects can be assessed by classifying their behavior, such as material transport vehicles, weapon transport vehicles and couriers. Of particular interest are object classes where dynamic information provides a clear advantage in classification over static imagery analysis, e.g. traditional automatic target recognition. Functional Interpretation of Activities and Objects will add a new dimension of information that is not attainable from traditional single-frame imagery. The purpose of buildings may be derived on city-wide scales, and abnormal buildings may be detected such as terrorist safe houses embedded in residential neighborhoods.

Recently many interesting and highly capable processing architectures have become available. These include the processors from the DARPA PCA program, commercial architectures such as the IBM CELL, stream processors, and Graphics Processing Units (GPU), to name a few. Often these architectures offer unique processing advantages for specific processing functions and areas that can result in significant increases in overall system performance. As an example, DARPA funded a project that explored using GPUs to significantly improve the performance of key kernels in the Army Computer Generated Forces (CGF) simulation application code, OneSAF. The effort demonstrated and transitioned the integration of GPU based line of sight (LOS), region-based visibility, and route-planning algorithms that resulted in a 10-20x overall simulation speed improvement. This example demonstrates that by dramatically improving a highly used specific function of an overall application that the overall system performance can be dramatically improved. DoD application codes of interest include: Simulation – at all levels to battlefield, weather and environmental modeling, automatic target detection and identification, Image processing and rendering, codes, flow models, physical models, quantum chemistry codes, circulation models, molecular dynamics codes, CFD models using overset grids, chip and system emulation. Key code functions that impact application performance such as line-of-sight, collision prediction, target isolation and identification, specific weather and environmental calculations, and other critical functionality that represent key code elements of overall application performance are also of interest. Additional application codes will be considered, particularly those of most relevance to the DoD. This effort will not develop new processing architectures. What this effort will do is selectively apply recently developed processing architectures to specific DoD processing performance challenged functions and applications.

However, combat situations—particularly in urban settings—severely interfere with these communication channels: explosions generate noise louder than the human voice, rooms in buildings interfere with line-of-sight, and so forth. DARPA seeks innovative approaches to the exploitation of the tactile sensory modality for communication of tactical information between soldiers at the squad level. This technology would be capable of receiving signals within a range of approximately 300 feet via devices (e.g., electrotactile or vibrotactile arrays) placed near or on the soldier’s skin. Technology used to send signals to the telehaptic receiver may also be a haptic device (e.g., haptic glove); in any case, approaches that interfere with the conventional soldier postures are discouraged. Proposers must quantify how much information they expect their end-to-end telehaptic communication systems would be able to carry relative to standard military hand signal vocabularies. Proposed research in the initial phase of this effort should focus on ergonomic, psychophysical, and information theoretic design aspects. For example, optimal device placement, size of the haptic communication channel, communication bandwidth requirements, and human attention constraints are all critical design principles to be addressed.

Traditionally, the objective of an NLP system is to organize the content of large text corpora for efficient retrieval and analysis. In this context, the organizational concepts (for, e.g., entities, categories, topics, relations) that NLP systems employ are designed to support retrieval and analysis at the strategic level. In addition, the principal operational concerns for these systems are accuracy (e.g., precision and recall) and scalability to multiple processors for large data volumes. DARPA seeks innovative approaches for text NLP for tactical applications, which have constrained computational resources, accelerated operational timelines, and specific intelligence objectives. Examples of tactical applications for which NLP would provide needed capability include: patrol mission planning, insurgent extraction, hostage rescue, and targeting. In these scenarios, text data from sources such as local newspapers, blogs, and press releases can bring to bear operationally specific and time-sensitive evidence. Further, warfighters may have only minutes (not hours or days) to process the data for key evidence that may result in tactical advantage, so speed along with accuracy is critical. As such, current approaches to NLP may have limited value to tactical military applications. Indeed, even when decoding performance is tractable (such as with Viterbi-based approaches), feature extraction for supervised techniques may itself be expensive, resulting in slow end-to-end performance of these systems. Further, although so-called ""shallow” language processing techniques such as part of speech tagging, chunk parsing, and entity recognition are typically fast, thus suitable for large volume and time-sensitive processing, textual evidence desired by the warfighter may be contextual or relational in nature: rather than extract all mentions of an ""explosive device,” which may result in a very large subset of documents, the warfighter may be looking for explosive devices in a particular region or to be detonated at a particular time. Similarly, the warfighter may seek information about a particular enemy target: instead of all mentions of the target, a narrowed search of any evidence that the target is in a particular region or city may be desired. In such cases, the semantic relations between entities of interest must be extracted. DARPA seeks fast algorithms and techniques for processing evidence from text to provide this tactical benefit. Successful proposals will identify realistic tactical domains and offer innovative NLP approaches that are accurate and scalable to large (>10 GB) datasets, but execute quickly (<15 minutes) only on a single mobile computing platform such as a notebook or ultraportable PC. The objective of this effort is not to reduce algorithm capability to match the processing capabilities of a mobile computing platform, but to develop new algorithms that deliver needed NLP capabilities for applications that by necessity must run on a platform with limited computational resources. Trainable systems that can be ported to multiple languages are of particular interest. Proposed research in the initial phase of this effort should focus on demonstrating, in a rigorously empirical and quantitative fashion, the capability of the offeror’s technical approach. Offerors must identify the tactical applications their approaches are intended to support and design experiments accordingly. Offerors must also clearly indicate the data sources they propose to use for development and testing, the classes/entities/relations/topics on which will they will concentrate, and metrics they will",556,3851,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/74249/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/74249/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,08.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:17:16,,,,,SB082-026_74249,DOD_SBIR_08_P1_C2_SB082-026,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:00.479042+00

Dismounts are difficult to detect and track in aerial video because of few pixels on target, erratic (non-Kalman ""non-linear"" in nature) motion, low frame rates, grouping behaviors and crowded conditions, and extended occlusions in urban areas. Current methods can fail when even one of these factors is present. DARPA is soliciting novel methods for simultaneously tracking multiple dismounts that address these challenges while maintaining reasonable computational complexity. Following decades of research investment, tracking technology is relatively robust for vehicles on open roads with little or no clutter. While advances are being made for semi-urban and urban conditions, it is likely that incremental extensions to existing methods will not solve the difficulties presented by urban conditions, particularly for dismounts. Instead, significant leaps in capability are sought that employ non-traditional techniques such as knowledge-based reasoning, the use of context, and the fusion of video segmentation and tracking. The developed algorithms should be able to detect and track an arbitrary number of dismounts across a range of speeds from a slow walk to a full sprint.

Currently deployed robots such as Packbot have essentially no autonomy and must be directly controlled by operators. For ground robots to become a member of a squad, they need to operate among multiple moving objects (e.g. the human members of the squad), in unstructured environments (e.g. through bushes and trees). In order to coordinate their motion with the rest of the squad, they therefore need to detect and track multiple moving objects in the nearby environment, and predict future trajectories. This detection and tracking component must be robust despite the robot's own motion (possibly very shaky), and despite the objects being often occluded and only partially visible. This SBIR topic is seeking new perception algorithms for analyzing streaming video and/or ladar. To improve the utility and widespread deployment of robots, they must become more automated without compromising the safety of those around them. Existing systems are not capable of reliably detecting and tracking dismounts and other moving objects, particularly using passive sensors such as video. New methods are sought that can detect moving dismounts and other moving objects from video sensors mounted on a moving robot, in real-time and at a sufficient distance such that the robot can stop or change course if collision is imminent. Recently, significant progress has been made in methods for detecting humans in single images [1]. As these methods generally rely on detecting silhouettes, they may suffer poor performance in military scenarios where soldiers wear camouflage uniforms. Processing multiple frames of video may be one way to help [2], but camera motion must be taken into account in the robotic domain. Incorporating scene classification and understanding may be another method for improving detection performance [3]. Accurate tracking is required for moving dismounts near the robot so that path planning can account for predicted trajectories. Tracking is straightforward when dismounts are detected reliably and well-separated from each other, and occlusions are brief. However, in typical conditions groups of dismounts are very common, and occlusions can last for many seconds. Recent advances in tracking have begun to address these issues [4] [5] but have not yet attained the accuracy required for operations, and usually assume a static or distant camera. The proposed methods should be able to track individuals in groups, through occlusions, and through move-stop-move conditions while the camera is moving.",415,2728,1,No,No,No,,Develop initial methods for detecting and tracking moving dismounts and other moving objects from a moving video camera mounted on a robot.

The PP accepts as input (i) a model of the current state of the environment, (ii) the current location of the vehicle in that environment, and (iii) the location of the goal point. As output, the PP produces a path from the current position to the goal point which optimizes an objective function. An example of an objective function is the cumulative cost of path traversal. Current state of the art and why it does not meet current requirements: Many currently deployed autonomous systems use a PP which assumes a static environment. See [1], for example. In many of these systems, the environment is represented as a 2½-D grid with each grid cell labeled with its cost of traversal. There is no explicit representation of a discrete ""object”; hence, it is difficult to encode the future trajectory of a moving object. Furthermore, the vehicle’s current location in the environment is usually dependent on GPS, so that performance degrades rapidly when GPS signals are not available. What research can be drawn on and what is the desired outcome of this SBIR: In order for autonomous systems to operate in militarily relevant, dynamic environments, it is necessary to develop a PP which accounts for moving objects, and plans paths which evade objects which are on a collision course. There has been a lot of work done on developing efficient path planners in the academic community. See [2] and [3], for example. This SBIR topic is focused on designing and developing a PP which will enable an autonomous vehicle with onboard sensors to navigate in militarily relevant environments. In particular, DARPA is seeking a PP with the following characteristics: 1. Uncertainty: The PP must be able to generate good paths even when the relative locations and trajectories of objects are only known approximately. This uncertainty is a result of limitations of the onboard sensors and sensor data processing. For example, camera-based sensors can often estimate range information with errors no better than 5%, and only out to a limited distance. 2. Realistic representation: The PP must operate on a model of the environment which could realistically be inferred using common on-board sensors and sensor processing algorithms. DARPA is not interested in a PP which requires unrealistically accurate or complete knowledge of objects’ relative sizes and/or positions. 3. No GPS: The PP must be able to operate in regions with no GPS coverage. This implies that the PP must be able to operate on representations in relative rather than absolute coordinates. In addition, an important criterion is selecting a path which can easily be executed without GPS. For example, it may be preferable to choose a longer path which stays within view of trackable landmarks, rather than a shorter path which is devoid of such beacons. 4. Efficiency: The PP needs to be able to compute a plan very efficiently. In addition, it needs to be able to adapt an existing plan to take into account a newly discovered object. Such re-planning should not require starting the planning process from scratch each time.",523,3165,1,No,No,No,,"Design an algorithm for planning paths through dynamic, GPS-denied environments, using realistic simulated models of the environment.

The methods should take advantage of feedback and interaction between human and robot, in a relevant visual problem domain such as robotic navigation, transport and interaction within a group of soldiers.","Robots such as Big Dog are becoming increasingly capable of providing basic services to soldiers in the field, such as transport of equipment and supplies on missions in difficult terrain where large vehicles are impractical or undesirable. A major technical barrier preventing the deployment of such assistant robots is the difficulty of programming and training a robot to assume a certain role in a group activity. A robot must know what is happening around it in order to act and react properly to changing circumstances. Currently, however, robots are programmed for very specific tasks in constrained environments, while teaching a robot a new task or behavior requires highly specialized technical knowledge. Furthermore, robots cannot react adequately to the dynamic, unstructured conditions usually found in operational areas because robotic understanding of the surrounding environment and activities is very limited. Overcoming these challenges will require a significant advance in robotic perception and environmental understanding. A robot must have knowledge of human activities that may happen nearby given the current context, and its own role in those activities. It must have representations for its tasks that are consistent with these activity models to enable adaptive reasoning and planning. Additionally, it must do this under the partial and inaccurate information obtained from its sensors. DARPA is seeking new approaches that combine human instruction and computer vision to efficiently and intuitively teach a robot how to build a model of, and subsequently recognize, human activities surrounding it from video cameras mounted on the robot. Statistical learning methods typically require substantial amounts of training data to achieve robustness, but human instruction can be used to compensate for the small training sets that would typically be available for realistic scenarios. The learning and recognition of human behavior, both individuals and groups, in video has advanced considerably in the past few years, but further advances must be made in order to achieve robustness under the difficulties presented by video from a mobile ground robot, such as missing, fragmented and erroneous tracks. The resulting system would enable a robot to safely interact with soldiers so that the robot becomes a significant asset to the group, and is never a liability. Example activities and scenarios of interest include group marching along a path, rapidly responding to an ambush or attack, and a coordinated attack on an enemy position.",388,2565,1,No,No,No,,Develop an initial formulation for using human instruction to significantly improve the efficiency of building a model of group activity and subsequent recognition from robot video data.

Maier and Delcambre (Ref. 2) have done work on superimposing multiple structures onto data without requiring changes to the underlying data. While this helps address the subjectivity of classification schemes by permitting multiple taxonomies or schemas to be used for the same data, the research has focused on formal methods and relational databases. The emergence of web sites that allow users to tag items such as images and URLs with keywords drawn from unconstrained vocabularies is a grass-roots response to users’ desires to organize data according to their own subjective preferences. Similarly, though on a smaller scale, technical journals have included keywords for some time in order to provide readers with very succinct snapshots of articles and to facilitate the discovery of related articles. While in this latter case the keywords are frequently drawn from terms particular to the argot of the targeted community, they are nonetheless not formally constrained. As communities grow around tagged data, the users informally internalize and adopt many of the terms used by other members of the community and a ""user-created bottom-up categorical structure […] with an emergent thesaurus” – that is, a folksonomy (Ref. 3) –emerges. This categorical structure, while captured in the lexicon of the users, lacks both the hierarchical structure that a formal taxonomy would provide and the utility for reasoning that would come from having an ontology that describes the underlying data. However much of this structure is still there and accessible to humans because the tags are words that have intrinsic meaning, synonyms, and associations and the structure is implicit in the language. If computers are to be able to exploit this information it must made explicit. Resources like WordNet (Ref. 4), Propbank (Ref. 5), and FrameNet (Ref. 6) provide information about relationships in the language that can be used to extract and construct an explicit representation however a great deal of work will be required to exploit this in the context of ill-defined communities employing unconstrained tagging vocabularies. This topic seeks proposals to develop a system that identifies and exposes taxonomic and onto logic structure that is latent in the folksonomic tags used in open, publicly available sites such as Google Image Labeler (http://images.google.com/imagelabeler) and demonstrates the ability to perform higher order processing of this data using the induced structure.",407,2685,1,No,No,No,,"Prepare a feasibility study for a system to couple linguistic tools with folksonomically classified data in order to induce and expose additional structure in the folksonomic classification schema.

Integration of hardware and software design is critical [1] if low-power consumption and high probability of detection (Pd) are to be achieved. This is especially true for Active Sensors Networks as the vast majority of low-power wireless sensor networks employ a passive detection modality [2]. Given the rate at which hardware improves, end users are understandably hesitant to invest in software packages which would be obsolete in a short period of time. In order to exploit network gain from a field of wireless active sensors, information must be shared between local groups of sensors, and processed to improve detection performance. Detection of signals within noise for these types of active sensors is a well studied problem. It is also well known that gains can be made by combining information from multiple sensors. Improved detection performance is not limited to Pd, but also encompasses classification, localization and tracking. Reduction of power consumption is obtained by careful balancing of wakeup rates, transmission periods (both communications and detection transmissions), periods of reception (in the multi-static case) and expected target velocities. Software packages that fully exploit a hardware presentation layer for both the sensor and Media Access Control (MAC) physical layers, as well as present a standardized application programming interface (API) to the signal and information processing layer are needed. This topic hopes to develop a software standard which would support current and future wireless active sensor networks, and thereby protect investments in information and signal processing application software. Active sensors can include Acoustic Echo-Location as well as RADAR, or any other active detection medium. Both mono-static and multi-static modalities should be supportable by the middleware, as well as the possibility that the device may or may not support inter-node communication via the detection medium.",322,2177,1,No,No,No,,"Prepare a feasibility study.

These sensors could be used for operator’s surveillance and weapon’s sighting systems, as well as for remote control of robotic platforms.","The need to stream real time video to remote locations has been established by the warfighter as they deploy the tools of the trade which include: sensors for surveillance and operational security and remote controlled robotic platforms. Specifically, in a weapon sighting system, there is the desire to create real time video transmission connectivity with zero latency, and no wires. Then, there is the added dimension of using the same wireless connectivity for surveillance supporting multiple objectives simultaneously. Within the robotics domain, the desire is to maintain low latency real time video to robot platforms for the purposes of steering and targeting through circuitous caves and urban canyons. To meet these operator driven needs, the Phase I tasks will include studying all applicable available Wireless Connectivity technologies to determine the pipe/Bandwidth, otherwise known as Through-put, for achieving real time streaming video in self powered, field-able gear, as well as systems in development. These systems will be screened for their applicability to providing small, low power, light weight, multi-hopping video streaming capabilities. Currently, there is streaming video available for use in vehicles and satellites which has the bandwidth and power to stream real time video via wireless connectivity, but they are bulky and consume too much power. In the field, at the operator’s level, there is no ability to accomplish this desired task, in man-portable, low power, mil-spec equipment, such as weapon sighting systems, real time surveillance sensors or robotic guidance systems. The problem in creating a wireless man-portable connectivity is the integration of 20-40 Gigahertz frequency components, which will provide a low power, high resolution, and high bandwidth link with more than 1Mbps. Blue tooth with its low power, frequency hopping 1MHz band has been shown to stream VHS type (low) quality video, but its limited range eliminates it from consideration for the missions at hand. 802.11 technologies have long shown the ability to stream video of various qualities, but they are power hungry, and lack frequency hopping stealthy-ness. Other technical formats exist which can move real time streaming video in the desired bandwidth/pipe. Up in the Gigahertz spectrum there are multiple solutions which can accommodate the ability to achieve high data rate, streaming video. The technology was developed for use in radar applications (1). The RF connectivity currently being used for wireless connectivity is in the MegaHertz (MHz) band; (i.e., such as FM), does not employ frequency hopping, and as such can be directionally found (DF) which is NOT acceptable for operational deployment. A GHz (Gigahertz) band solution offers the potential to stream real time video, all the while frequency hopping to achieve stealthy-ness and connectivity for wireless streaming video. To the DF equipment, the signature looks like white noise, and cannot be triangulated, which is desired by warfighters. State of the art for this Gigahertz solution is that there are very few companies who have created the chipsets (commercial or otherwise) for use by military operators. Therefore, the goal of this SBIR R&D will be to bring about the detailed use of the Gigahertz wireless connectivity by creating a functional, wireless, real time, multi-hopping streaming video system on a small low power platform.

With current laser engagement training technology, for instance, soldiers do not get to see tracers (theirs or the enemy’s), the strike of the rounds, explosions, or other weapons effects. At combined arms training centers, personnel who speak foreign languages are used to make training for urban operations in those parts of the world more effective. Those foreign-speaking personnel, who are training overhead as they are not part of the training audience, are not easily available. With mixed reality, those training enablers could be used to support training in many geographically distant locations. A handful of real personnel acting as the inhabitants of a small village could be multiplied through the use of mixed reality to look like a fully inhabited village. Mixed reality is not a new concept. Several attempts have been made to build such systems [1, 3, 5, 6, and 7]. These systems typically train only a handful of soldiers, and require extensive and expensive infrastructure. Many of these systems require the user to remain in a fixed location; although, he can look around. Others allow the trainee to be ""untethered,” but work in a small number of rooms, perhaps just one, and require extensive instrumentation and infrastructure [1, 3, and 4]. Often they also require the trainee to wear special equipment to help the system track the location, orientation, and pose of each real actor in the scene. These limitations of current technology make it impractical to train platoons and companies in the real world. One of the key technology gaps that makes mixed reality impractical today is the ability to accurately locate the trainee in the world. If such a system determines the wrong rifle orientation by as little as .091 degrees, a simulated shot would completely miss a man-sized target at 300 meters distance. Being wrong by as little as four centimeters can result in rendered images coming through walls instead of doors. To make implementation practical, such a technology would need the potential to be completely soldier-worn, require no special markers to be worn, and be infrastructure free. ""Infrastructure free” means that there are no external sensors, such as cameras, that must be deployed in the training area; although, it does permit the presence of a communication infrastructure between the soldier-worn systems and a server that provides the synthetic entities and effects to be displayed to the live trainee. The identification of this technology would point the way toward implementation of a practical, infrastructure-free mixed reality system for deployed and home-station training. Another of the key technology gaps that makes mixed reality impractical today is the ability to do real-time depth sensing and occlusion mapping. When viewing a scene in the real world, humans know that one object is in front of another because it partially occludes the other.

It has been demonstrated that units tend to suffer higher casualty rates in their first engagements with the enemy. Several studies exist that document this phenomenon for pilots and aircrews. In air combat over Vietnam, ""forty percent of all pilot losses occurred in their first three engagements. However 90 percent of those who survived three engagements went on to complete a combat tour.” [Scales, pp. 20-21]. A review of existing literature and informal interviews with veterans from Vietnam to Iraq suggests that causes of combat casualties are related to six factors: 1) ability to cope with sensory overload, 2) ability to overcome stress and fear, 3) ability to maintain unit cohesion, 4) confidence in unit leadership, 5) maintaining threat awareness, and 6) understanding the proper use and implications of terrain. Specifically, the factors can chain together when sensory overload and isolation lead to increased stress/fear which in turn can lead to higher casualties. These casualties may be mitigated by unit cohesion, confidence in leadership, awareness of threats and the proper use of terrain. Studies ""show that soldiers with a greater mental aptitude are more self-confident and are better able to deal with ambiguous and confusion situations” [Daddis, p. 23]. Based on his analysis, Daddis asserts that ""incorporating battlefield stimuli—the sights, sounds, and smells of a firefight—into training makes training real… Experiential learning is critical in sensitizing soldiers to the bedlam of combat. Leaders must create unpredictability in their training events yet allow failure among leaders and followers… Creating sensory chaos in training (chaos that often cannot be realized in simulation centers) can only be done by creating sensory chaos during training. Soldiers must train in situations where they can learn how they individually respond to stress and anxiety” [Daddis, p. 26]. After their first combat, among many combat veterans, a kind of depression sets in because ""their first experience of combat had not turned out the way they had imagined it would. They were used to the orderly sham battles of field exercises; the real thing proved more chaotic and much less heroic than they had anticipated, and the mutilation caused by modern weapons came as a shock.” [Kellet, p. 313] Spiszer also asserts that in training soldiers must be exposed to realistic ""sights, sounds, smells and feelings of isolation and fear when they occur” [Spiszer, p. 69]. Bradshaw asserts that all soldiers experience battlefield stress, but that tough training under realistic conditions can reduce battlefield stress [Bradshaw, pp. 20-21]. Researchers have asserted that battlefield stress and fear can lead to higher mental and physical casualties, but this can be mitigated. Describing the Israeli experiences in 1973, Belenky stated that ""the battalion ranked as having the greatest stress (on the basis of preparation, type of battle, tactical and logistic support, and confidence in higher headquarters) had the highest number of physical casualties, the highest number of psychiatric casualties but that Israeli Defense Force soldiers from units with good leadership, good unit cohesion and who had stable personal and family lives were less likely",556,3549,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/74243/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/74243/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,08.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:17:20,,,,,SB082-036_74243,DOD_SBIR_08_P1_C2_SB082-036,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:00.479042+00

The widespread and growing use of inexpensive wireless systems for explosive devices, communication, and surveillance has also created a need to proliferate RF sensor systems. Advances in highly efficient, low-cost antenna systems would facilitate performance and cost improvements in these systems. These systems need to operate in any kind of environment, whether airborne, fixed terrestrial, or mobile. The antenna system performance must support independent operation of its host platform. The receive-only antenna needs to be wideband and truly omni in both amplitude and phase (i.e., no phase irregularities in azimuth and elevation) and be able to receive any of the myriad of communications signals, including military communications systems, cellular systems, WLAN, WiMAX, surveillance and targeting radars, and ultra wide band signals. One of the enabling components of this new concept in monitoring technology is the interface between the sensor receiver and free space; namely the antenna. An antenna for this surveillance platform must not only be small, but it must also be reconfigurable to ensure that maximum efficiency, dynamic mutual coupling tolerance, and coverage area is achievable at all times, for any frequency and in any environment. The development of this new form of wireless technology is extremely challenging and will require orders of magnitude advances in performance in several new RF/electromagnetic/antenna R&D areas. New smart materials that can adaptively control the direction of the radiation over a wide band of frequencies could help make the antenna effectively independent of its surroundings. Intelligent impedance matching circuitry between the antenna output and the wideband receiver can ensure maximum power is delivered to the receiver helping to improve the overall efficiency of the antenna platform and contribute to its independence of the mounting environment over a wide band of frequencies.

Furthermore, fiber-optical technologies can potentially replace their electronic counterparts in accomplishing such critical functions as microwave signal processing in radar communication systems. The broad bandwidth and low transmission losses afforded by the optical fiber coupled with its immunity to electromagnetic interference make it the transmission medium of choice for such applications. However, to be rapidly adopted and deployed in military systems fiber-optical links should operate with low noise figure (NF), coupled with link gain and should allow for large dynamic range operation. Such system level requirements place very demanding performance and reliability specifications on the components that constitute the system, primarily the laser, the modulator, and the photodetector. The laser should be capable of very high-power (> 1W) operation with low relative intensity noise (RIN). The modulator should be able to withstand high optical input powers without sustaining optical damage and be capable of a low Vƒà (~ 1 V) and low optical insertion loss (~ 5 dB) operation. The phototector should be able to withstand several hundreds of mWs of optical power and operate in a linear regime with a high responsivity (~ 0.9 mA/mW). Concurrently meeting all these requirements has proven elusive in state-of-the-art approaches. While significant progress has been made [1], state-of-the-art modulators still suffer from significant optical damage in the presence of large optical powers (~1W), and their optical insertion loss is also high (~ 10 dB). The main reason for the limited success of prior efforts is that there exists a number of trade-offs relating two or more modulator characteristics. Specifically, a lower Vƒàƒnƒn requires a longer electrode. This in turn leads to a longer device that results in a higher electrical and optical insertion loss. Since the maximum length of a LiNbO3chip is limited in practice, folded designs have been considered. Despite some progress achieved recently towards reducing optical loss in multiple-pass modulator structures, it still remains rather high and may defeat the very purpose of lowering Vpi. A high optical loss requires a high optical power at the input which may lead to optical damage. Photodetectors on the other hand saturate at a few hundred mW of optical power and are not capable of linear operation. Hence, there is a need to develop a modulator technology that allows for high-sensitivity (low noise figure with link gain) operation while avoiding optical power damage, high optical insertion loss and photodetector saturation. This SBIR topic focuses on the development of LiNbO3 modulators in order to enable high-sensitivity links (a link gain of 20 to 25 dB coupled with a noise figure in the 3-6 dB range) while avoiding optical power damage, high optical insertion loss and photodetector saturation. A further objective of the SBIR effort is the development of modulator designs that can also provide RF filtering. The proposed approach should be practical and may be implemented with a relatively low-cost, high-yield manufacture process.",503,3312,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a feasibility study on multi-gigahertz opto-electronic modulators that can simultaneously modulate multiple optic signals with a single RF input.

Multiple-frequency sources are divided into broad classes of coherent and incoherent devices, with the former playing a critical role in phased and frequency-agile systems [4]. A jam-proof radar/lidar system exploits fast spectral hopping by using the coherent frequency comb for calibration or waveform synthesis purposes. A common example of incoherent comb is given by a set of independent sources combined by a conventional Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) multiplexer: its spectrum forms a fixed CW wavelength comb. A WDM-multiplexed source is also an impractical construct since it implies unnecessary complexity (a 100-line comb requires 100 precisely stabilized lasers) and no flexibility (the comb spectral density is limited by the WDM multiplexer block). An alternative approach uses a single laser cavity oscillating at multiple frequencies simultaneously. However, the construction of such a device requires the combination of stabilized cavities and a spectrally equalized gain response; the tolerances placed on both are severe since each comb frequency competes for the available gain. Widely used class of coherent comb sources is based on mode-locked lasers: frequency characteristics of the comb are precisely defined by the cavity properties. Unfortunately, this class of sources is fundamentally limited because: a) the source stability (amplitude/temporal jitter) is defined by the stability of the cavity, b) CW operating regime is not possible. In addition, conventional sources are limited to equidistant frequency grid generation; an arbitrarily defined frequency plan (such as progressively offset frequency comb) is yet to be addressed. A different class of comb sources [5], uses a recirculating frequency-shifting element to generate a set of stable, phase-locked frequencies. A single-sideband modulator (SSB) comb generator, used as a frequency-shifting element, translates the seed laser by a precise, RF-defined frequency during each pass within the fiber loop. The internal loop loss is offset by the gain element which, in contrast to Modelocked (ML) sources, does not enable lasing but loss-balancing only. The presence of this gain element is the critical design limitation since: 1) The bandwidth of the system (comb spectral width) depends on the available amplifier bandwidth. 2) The noise characteristic of the amplifier ultimately determines the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the generated comb. Both constraints can be addressed by introducing the parametric (phase-sensitive) gain element instead of conventional (phase-insensitive) amplifier: 1. The amplifier bandwidth can be substantially wider than the gain bandwidth of conventional amplifiers such as Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), Raman or Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOAs), thus providing for high-count harmonic generation. 2. The noise figure (NF) of the parametric gain block can, in principle, be considerably lower than that of a phase-insensitive amplifier by operating the system in phase-locked regime. An optimal system (NF~1) would allow for comb generation with CNR approaching that of original seed tone. More importantly, the parametric gain block can be used in a self-seeded frequency role: an original seed frequency, split by SSB modulator in two tones can be subsequently mixed within the parametric gain block to generate additional frequencies via four-photon mixing. If the practical self-seeding in parametric block can be validated, the next generation of universal comb and clock",529,3662,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/74057/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/74057/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,08.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:17:21,,,,,SB082-040_74057,DOD_SBIR_08_P1_C2_SB082-040,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:00.479042+00

While critical applications [1] in blue-green band await high-power solution, key technical blocks have matured and provide a clear path to construction of a new class of parametric sources. Firstly, high-powered diode lasers have become commercially available due to their use as pump sources for Dioide Pumped Solid State (DPSS) Yttrium Aluminium Garnet (YAG), DPSS Yttrium Vanadate (YVO4), rare-earth doped fiber lasers (Yb, Er, Bi and Th) as well as Raman amplifiers for long-haul telecommunication systems. Competition and other market pressures have continually improved the performance of diode laser pumps such that electrical to optical conversion efficiencies greater than 50% are now routine as are lifetimes of several 10’s of thousands of hours even at powers approaching 100 W per bar. The diversity of applications has also rendered these devices inexpensive and readily available. Secondly, the advent of large mode-area (LMA) fibers now allow for kW class lasers emitting into a single spatial mode. These devices achieve their single mode nature by the use of large mode-area, dual-core fibers where the inner core is in fact multimode at the emission wavelength but coiled to suppress lasing in the higher order modes and so still achieve excellent beam quality. Finally, the use of nonlinear effects (SBS) to ""cleanup” the spatial characteristics of diode pump sources [2, 3, 4] motivated the demonstration of a single-mode Raman fiber laser using a multimode fiber. [5] The work by Baek and Roh convincingly showed that a multimode pump beam in a multimode fiber could be used to produce a single-mode output beam as a result of the physics of the nonlinear conversion process rather than by fiber-coil-induced mode selection. In related but independent work [6], Watts level emission at the sodium D-line for a guide-star application was demonstrated by frequency-doubling the Raman-shifted output from a fiber laser. It is plausible that the recent developments can be unified to produce first practical all-solid-state Watt class source in the blue-green spectral region capable of addressing arbitrary wavelength. A multimode fiber Raman laser development will spatially clean up and simultaneously frequency convert the low-brightness emission of high-powered diode pump lasers into high-brightness light appropriate for efficient nonlinear frequency conversion, via parametric processes, to produce blue-green wavelengths at high efficiency and high power compared to existing technologies.",395,2633,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a study to determine the feasibility of developing a multimode-fiber, multi-Watt, and Blue-Green Raman laser.

Arrays of near infrared (808 or 980 nm) laser diodes are capable of extremely high power (60-100 W). The array is processed as one unit and handled/packaged in a similar manner to individual laser diodes. As the quantum cascade laser is also based on wafer-scale technology, the same array capability exists but has not been fully explored. While power output can generally be increased by increasing the number of emitters, there are two primary obstacles to maintaining efficient power delivery. The first is excess heat generation. Even the best quantum cascade lasers are only ~10% power efficient near room temperature. Packaging many lasers together in one monolithic array scales the heat generation along with the power, and thermal crosstalk will, in general, decrease the overall array performance. The second major problem with laser arrays is beam quality. Given individual emitters with divergent output beams the total array is likely to have divergence that is significantly above the diffraction limit for a large emitting aperture. Thus, when using multiple cavities for high power output, a mechanism for combining individual cavity outputs into a single, high quality beam is required. Several techniques exist for coherent beam combining, including phased arrays and spectral beam combining, but these have not been yet applied to mid-wave or long-wave infrared sources. Mid-wave- (3<lambda<5 micron) and long-wave-infrared (8<lambda<12 micron) semiconductor lasers arrays that emit multi-watt average powers with beam qualities close to the diffraction limit would be highly desirable for compact, remote electro-optic systems. DoD applications include remote chemical sensing, infrared countermeasures and LADAR.

Direct modulation of over 10 Gbit/s has been demonstrated. Unfortunately, due to long carrier lifetimes in traditional interband diode lasers, higher speed modulation typically requires external modulation. For high bandwidth communication, wavelength division multiplexing is typically used, which requires multiple laser sources and detectors to properly transmit large volumes of information. For 1 Tbit/s bandwidth, this requires 100 lasers. Thus, the benefits of having a compact and robust light source are negated by the system scale. Intersubband lasers and detectors interact with light through electron transitions within specially designed quantum wells. The electron lifetime is controlled by electron-phonon interactions, and is thus much shorter than what one would find in a traditional diode laser. For heavy electron mass systems, the carrier lifetime is extremely short, on the order of 150-400 fs for heavy effective mass systems such as the III-Nitrides. Properly utilized in a laser source this could potentially lead to Tbit/s data transmission from a single source. While other intersubband lasers have been developed at longer wavelengths (3-190 ƒÝm), the short wavelength infrared is quite difficult to access as it requires very deep quantum wells. Traditional material systems such as InP or GaAs cannot achieve such deep quantum wells. On the other hand, the GaN/AlN quantum well system can achieve band offsets on the order of 2.1 eV, which is more than enough to realize 1.55 micron wavelength sensitivity. Unfortunately, there are two primary challenges in realizing an electrically pumped III-Nitride intersubband laser. First, the short electron lifetimes make the spontaneous photon emission very inefficient. This makes it extremely difficult to generate photon gain, which makes the threshold current density intrinsically very high. The second problem is related to material growth and crystalline quality. For efficient tunneling transport, required in this type of structure, Very thin (1-3 nm) Al(Ga,In)N layers are required, and interface roughness has a very large effect on the gain profile. At the same time, the choice of substrate is limited, which can lead to further, dislocation-based, degradation of the material quality. In the literature, there has been research to show that intersubband absorption can occur in III-Nitride heterostructures at the required telecom wavelength (1.55 ƒÝm). Single quantum wells have demonstrated intersubband emission in the 2-2.5 ƒÝm wavelength range, and coupled quantum wells have shown clear absorbance signatures at even shorter wavelengths. As of yet, no electrically-pumped device has been demonstrated, but several designs have been postulated.",413,2818,1,No,No,No,,Investigate the design and limiting theoretical and experimental factors involved in producing intersubband emission from III-Nitride quantum wells and coupled quantum wells.,"Demonstrate material characterization, including infrared absorption and/or emission, for a III-Nitride intersubband heterostructure sensitive to wavelengths near 1.55 ƒÝm.

Such a clock distribution network could be used to synchronize many digital/mixed-signal components on multiple PCBs and even between separate instrumentation racks.

This is a very challenging requirement that calls for novel approaches and technical solutions. Utilization of the three-dimensional packaging of the wireless sensor may be one alternative, or the use of new loading materials (such as electromagnetic bandgap structures [7], or the equivalent) may provide a small radiating solution. These techniques could also be applied to the ground-plane to reduce its size and therefore the entire antenna. The use of an accurate three-dimensional full-wave electromagnetic simulation tool that can assist with the proposed investigations into new small antenna technologies is an important aspect of this topic. Once the new radiator technology has been established, there is still the issue associated with reduced efficiency/bandwidth. Even for the modest bandwidth requirements for most communication systems, small antenna technology cannot reach these targets; typically the gain of the power amplifiers or Low Noise Amplifiers are increased to compensate for the reduction in efficiency leading to reduced battery life of the radio. Intelligent impedance matching circuitry (sometimes referred to as non-fosters circuits) between the antenna and the transceiver could ensure the delivery of maximum power between the radiator and the transceiver, helping to improve the overall efficiency of the antenna platform [8].

The lighting industry is a key example. While InGaN is ideally suited for high efficiency lighting alternatives, it will not be able to compete with existing technology until the cost of manufacturing can be realistically measured in pennies-per-unit. Achieving this goal will require alternatives to the standard InGaN epitaxial techniques of MOCVD and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).

Specifically, material of sufficient quality for efficient light emitting diodes or photovoltaic applications is suitable. The proposed technique must be easily scalable such that it would provide quality material at less than half the cost of MOCVD at an equal production level. The preferred cost is less than a tenth that of MOCVD at an equal production level.

To supply power, the DoD must ship fuel to tactical areas. It is common that transporting the fuel requires as much or more energy than the fuel provides. To solve this problem, the DoD has invested substantial resources in developing renewable sources of energy to mitigate the exorbitant cost of transporting fuel. The two most prominent sources for renewable energy are solar and wind energy. The problems with solar energy are: 1) under the best conditions, it is only available for, at most, half of the day; and 2) power requirements, necessitate large-scale (permanent) installations that require substantial amounts of area to deploy. Extracting energy via wind generators also presents challenges; only certain geographic areas can provide the sustained wind speeds required to generate power, and like solar power, large (permanent) land-based turbines require a substantial amount of area. These disadvantages can be eliminated with offshore wind turbines. There are a plethora of maritime locations with high-velocity sustained winds, and the large area required for installation can easily be provided. They are also far less susceptible to attack in the ocean. The current limitation is that offshore wind turbines are permanently installed on the ocean floor and are not designed to ever be easily moved. The proposed SBIR topic is to develop a floating platform that can be relocated and can support a large offshore wind turbine. A large floating offshore wind turbine can support the DoD energy generation requirements in remote locations, or support disaster relief efforts where local power generation has been destroyed and/or the fuel supply has been disrupted. When the DoD no longer needs the power generation capacity, the systems could be removed and transferred to another location. Moreover, floating wind turbines can be installed in water depths that traditional pile-mounted systems, could not accommodate and, in theory, could support much larger wind turbines as well. The problem with floating offshore wind turbine systems is that they are inherently unstable. The turbine and generators, which represent the majority of the system weight, are mounted at the highest point on the structure, creating a high center of mass off the water and making it very difficult to transport and operate in the open ocean. Additionally, traditional, offshore platforms have relied on complex mooring systems in order to maintain stability and position. These mooring systems are permanent and undesirable for the envisioned system which requires mobility. The goal of this project would be to develop a novel offshore platform that would be able to support the wind turbine during transit, and would not use moorings during operation. Concepts could include, but are not limited to, novel hull forms, innovative operational techniques, or variable geometry platforms that could raise and lower the turbine for transit, or using collapsing blades or structures. In order to maintain station, the system should use a combination of active thrusters, variable hull-form geometry, or other innovative techniques. The system must keep position within a 25 ft radius, to avoid collisions, when distributed in a farm configuration. Additionally, the system can be towed at a speed of at least 7 knots, operate in year long intervals with only routine maintenance, in up to 50 mph winds, and survive 70 mph winds and a sea state 9.",553,3521,1,No,No,No,,"Prepare a feasibility study based on first principles and computational modeling to develop an offshore platform that can support a wind turbine and maintain station, without the use of mooring lines.

With highly directional line-of-sight links, developing optical communication networks is problematic. In addition, precise pointing, acquisition and tracking are required, with aerosols and particulates absorbing laser energy at these frequencies. However, at UV frequencies laser energy is scattered more than it is absorbed by the atmosphere. Furthermore, in the UV band from 220-280 nm the Earth’s ozone layer absorbs most UV radiation incident from the sun, so that there is little or no naturally occurring background radiation in this UV band. Here we propose to exploit this natural scattering and lack of background radiation to create an optical bubble of UV light with a diameter of 1-4 km, within which multi-user ad-hoc non-line-of-sight UV communication would be possible. Exploiting this phenomenon requires the development of new, novel multi-user networking strategies, protocols, coding schemes and modulation formats tailored to optical communications requirements. The existence of such a network would enable seamless communication in radio frequency (RF) denied hostile environments. The UV non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications physical layer is quite different from radio frequency (RF). Existing RF signal waveforms and multi-access algorithms are designed for a channel that is described by Gaussian or Rayleigh noise statistics and continuous waveforms. In contrast, optical communications at UV frequencies are described by Poisson statistics, which presents the receivers with signals that are highly variable from bit to bit (fast fading), and are made up of quantized (discontinuous) photon streams. RF networks are based on links with a 1/R2 range dependence on power, whereas UV communications links have a 1/R dependence.

As an example, a MAN-enabled alert system would monitor, correlate, and notify operations and communications professionals of potentially impacted military operations as well as the causal network events that rely on potential or actual degraded systems rather than just indicating the network or system failures. Proposed solutions may require operation at a very high granularity – perhaps at the packet or message level, rather than at the user or application level. They should also be autonomic or semi-autonomic systems that map their mission to the underlying infrastructure in highly dynamic coevolutionary domains where users, networks, and missions change over time. In addition to critical event detection and improving situational awareness, this capability is required prior to developing autonomic defense and management systems. These systems will determine when an event has occurred that impacts DoD missions, then develop potential courses of action that are run through mission impact analysis, so an informed course of action can be selected that minimizes harmful impact to DoD missions. The DoD has developed an overarching concept known as Net-Centric Warfare (NCW), which is the implementation of information age technology and concepts into the U.S. military. The DoD defines NCW as information superiority enabled concept of operations that generates increased combat power by networking sensors, decision makers, and shooters as well as administrative and business processes to achieve shared awareness, increased speed of command, higher tempo of operations, greater lethality, increased survivability, and a degree of self synchronization. In essence, NCW translates information superiority into combat power by effectively linking knowledgeable entities. To facilitate NCW, DoD operators and leaders must understand the relationships that exist between mission and business requirements and the information that supports the mission. Key challenges to MAN include: • There is a lack of basic science on information utility as it pertains to organizational missions and information technology. The result is commercial systems that label entire systems, users, or applications as mission critical at all phases of operations. This results in a gross overestimate of worth and over provisioning of resources to the wrong activity at the wrong time. • Organizational missions and tasks, as well as the information and communications infrastructure are highly dynamic. Not only do missions change over time, but priorities change within phases of missions. Network devices, links, data, applications, configurations, and users are constantly changing. • The DoD operates in a hostile environment (both physically and logically), where opponents are not only seeking to understand what the organization is doing, but also prevent the organization from achieving its goals. This spectrum of hostilities may run from espionage to physical destruction.

Work in this area has recently been reviewed (1, 2). The goal of this topic is to develop innovative multiferroic composites which can be used for heat pumps. Combinations of magnetocaloric and electrocaloric materials offer the potential to design electric field actuated heat pumps and significantly reduce the mass of magnetic refrigerators through elimination of magnets. The strain coupled magnetocaloric and ferroelectric or piezoelectric materials may also enable solid state thermoacoustic stirling engines which would operate at high frequency and therefore have high power density. The magnetocaloric effect is the change in temperature of a magnetic material with a change in magnetic field. Magnetic refrigerators utilize this effect for cooling. An example of research in this area is given in reference 3. A goal of this topic is to use strain (magnetostriction) instead of a change in magnetic field to generate a temperature change. Multiferroics can be used to apply a strain to a magnetic phase using a strain coupled ferroelectric with an applied electric field. Another type of refrigerator is the thermoacoustic Stirling engine (4, 5). Thermoacoustic Stirling cycle coolers (4, 5) use acoustic power to pump heat from low temperature to higher temperature sinks. They typically operate by transferring the adiabatic heat of compression of an acoustic wave in a high pressure helium chamber with a heat-transfer stack. The thermoacoustic refrigeration systems move thermal energy like a bucket brigade along the heat transfer stack. The higher operating frequency of a solid state equivalent of an acoustic refrigerator would enable design of more compact refrigerators/coolers. Another goal of this topic would be to design an all solid state version of the acoustic refrigerator using multiferroic composites. For the purposes of this topic, the design parameters (temperatures of source and sink, and cooling capacity) will be 300 watts pumped between 50 degrees C and 21 degrees C which would be useful cooling for an individual soldier wearing chemical-biological protective gear.

Hence it will become vital that future military wireless systems have the ability to ""look through” transmission signals; i.e., they must be able to receive during transmission. Perhaps the most stressing situation for simultaneous transmit and receive is the ability to receive even during a system’s own transmission of signals. Because on many platforms the space for antennas is limited, there is the need to use the same aperture for both transmit and receive functions. The need to do STAR will have ramifications throughout the surveillance/ communications system design. The design and implementation of transmit-receive (T/R) modules will be particularly challenging for new platforms that require remote installation, along with significant reduction of size, weight and power (SWAP). Photonics have promised to be a key enabling technology for distribution of signals, as well as the active transmission and reception of signals. Some of the key T/R module performance metrics for STAR are bandwidth, receive noise figure and transmit-receive isolation. Since bandwidth greater one decade is often required, there is a need for alternative technologies to a conventional RF circuits to provide isolation and preselection for signal processing. The overall objective of the STAR development is: Bandwidth greater than one decade; receive noise figure less than 6 dB; T/R isolation greater than 40 dB across the bandwidth.",251,1684,1,No,No,No,,"Design a Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR) T/R module utilizing photonic technology with the capability of providing simultaneous transmission and reception of RF signal over a wide bandwidth.Identify a technology development path to achieving these goals within a system application combining radar, passive direction finding and communications in a crowded signal environment.

In addition, SARO involves response to emergencies and support to local communities in providing medical, police, and refugee services. Collaboration between members of the local civilian and military communities is not only mutually beneficial but in many cases necessary for the successful fulfillment of SARO objectives. While the roles and responsibilities of military personnel for various types of SARO are well-defined, the processes for engagement with members of the civilian community have considerably less doctrine associated with them. This presents a ""geosocial” challenge to military leaders seeking support from civilians with the expertise and interests relevant for a particular SARO. DARPA is interested in developing a Geosocial Inference for Stability and Reconstruction Operations (GISARO) system that facilitates the interaction between members of local military and civilian communities based on their location, influence, and interests. GISARO would incorporate geospatial knowledge with information about local customs and social structures to provide decision support for SARO commanders. GISARO would be capable of answering the ""Five W’s and One H” pertaining to the civilian geosocial aspects of a SARO: who to communicate with, what information they need, when to approach them, where to meet them, why their support is vital, and how they may interact with military personnel. GISARO would also hypothesize complex activity workflows composed of civilian and military community members that best accomplish a particular SARO, i.e., the appropriate sequence of social interactions for meeting the SARO objectives. The system would potentially leverage emerging knowledge representation, machine learning and reasoning, geographic information systems, social networking service, semantic web, and collaboration technologies to achieve these technical goals. Proposed research in the initial phase of this effort should focus on demonstrating, in a rigorously empirical and quantitative fashion, the capability of the offeror’s technical approach.

The design and demonstration of innovative high dynamic range, broadband digital receiver systems based on optical analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology is of interest. These ADCs require ultrashort-pulsed optical sources with extremely low timing jitter and low noise, and offer the potential for high dynamic range digitization and broad unambiguous frequency coverage. A variety of high performance signal processing is possible with this approach[1]. These sources may also have applications as wavelength division multiplexed sources integrated with arrays of modulators[2] for very high capacity communications. Recently, a number of techniques have been demonstrated[3] that allow short pulse generation with extremely low timing jitter, under 200 fs. This level of performance has not been achievable with electronic pulse sources. Present optical mode locked laser technology utilizes a large number of optical elements. Recent developments in making photonic integrated circuits[4] suggest that integration of the elements is possible, enabling the demonstration of compact, high performance short pulses sources at low cost. Further, the recent advances in lowering waveguide losses together with the lower losses resulting from monolithic integration should allow the demonstration of lower levels of intensity and phase noise, resulting in improved levels of timing jitter.

True 3-D circuit integration (as opposed to 3D packaging or multi-chip modules) integrates multiple wafer, or die, tiers into a single circuit, which provides greater bandwidth and lower power by eliminating much of the off-chip signaling normally done in 2D IC¡¯s. There has been success, to date, in die-level stacking of edge connected tiers and with through-silicon interconnection of 2 tiers with vias sizes of 1-10 micrometers, but there has been no evidence of achieving through-silicon integration of 3 or more layers near these dimensions. Furthermore, circuit designers have limited CAD and simulation tools with which to explore and design in a 3D topology. CAD technology must also be developed in the areas of 3D layout and routing tools, taking into account exclusion areas (for the vias) and inter-layer timing delays, as well as electro-thermal management and 3D design space exploration for achieving optimal 3D implementations. To date, the state-of-the art 2-tier systems have avoided thermal issues by putting the active logic on a single layer and using the second layer for memory or passives. It would be highly desirable to move beyond this constraint and be able to perform the appropriate analysis to build active logic on any layer for optimum system performance.

To image large visual fields with conventional cameras, imaging parameters, such as viewing direction, need to be varied to relocate the narrow visual field across the scene. Innovative camera designs are needed to achieve the high resolution everywhere, so they provide global views as well as capture local details. The desired design would exploit physical (real-time) processes to acquire seamless, high-acuity, real-time video over a large, contiguous visual field, with high geometric fidelity, common viewpoint, no blind spots, and high color and brightness sensitivity in all directions. Currently available designs, including those using a single sensor with a large field of view, and those using a cluster of multiple sensors without a common viewpoint generally do not meet these needs. For example, current ultra-wide field of view video systems that offer the requisite resolution do so with camera arrays that are neither compact nor lightweight. The required design should allow a cost-performance tradeoff by giving user the option of reducing unit costs in exchange for reduced field of view or reduced image quality. Low cost and compactness are major considerations for acceptability. DARPA seeks a compact, lightweight video camera system that offers extreme angular coverage, such as a hemispherical view (180 degree horizontal x 180 degree vertical) or a quarter sphere view (90 degree H x 90 degree V), while maintaining high resolution, such as 0.4 mrad/pixel or better (1.25 cycles/mrad or better) over the entire field of view without the need to pan the camera to cover the visual field. The video camera system should be free of imagery common artifacts such as skew and smear. The system should be robust, with low/no maintenance operation and low power consumption. The video stream should be no less than 25 frames per second (non-interlaced) and should be capable of performing on-board processing for sensitivity adjustment, noise correction and dynamic equalization at operational video rates. The camera system should meet the following size, weight and power requirements, inclusive of all optics and electronics necessary to produce the desired video output, but exclusive of external packages necessary for environmental protection, electrical connectors for power, control, and video signals, and electronics necessary for power supply and/or power conditioning: – The camera system shall fit within a simple form factor not exceeding 2000 cubic centimeters in volume.. – The camera system shall weigh no more than 0.5 kg. – The camera system shall consume no more than 20 watts electrical power, including buffers or drivers necessary for either digital output or conventional video output.

These large sensors, which cover a wide field of view, fulfill the requirements for many applications, but are especially important in helmet-mounted systems for both ground and pilotage applications. However, the display technology essential to presenting the large amount of information generated by the sensor lags considerably behind the sensor technology. Currently, display technology is limited in field of view, and does not have the integral signal processing to match the capability of large format sensors and to adapt the information to meet user needs. The need to efficiently display a large amount of information to the user is crucial to mission success. Information must be available to detect threats at the periphery of vision, to discern details as needed by the situation, and to perform intricate tasks. Meeting all of these requirements simultaneously requires a significant leap-forward in display and signal processing technology. The display must meld the requirement for full panoramic field of view with the need for an adaptable, high resolution instantaneous field of view. The display must provide high image quality in a light weight package, with the ergonomics required for user acceptance, such as the center of mass optimized for head-mounted applications. The display format must be extended beyond the current state of the art, leading to innovative concepts in Mega-pixel displays with a high visual acuity in the central region and lower resolution in the periphery of the display. Novel signal processing and image reconstruction techniques must be applied to present the user with the essential scene content. The goal is to develop innovative sampling techniques that require only a small percentage of the data to reconstruct high quality scene information. These techniques have been demonstrated in radar and acoustic signal processing, but not implemented in helmet mounted displays. Although signal processing techniques have been demonstrated, there is considerable risk in the implementation of these techniques in display systems. However, the pay-off is large, enabling the user to grasp the large amount of information generated in a panoramic scene. Emerging technologies in compressive sampling, where the information rate may be much smaller than the bandwidth, enables the presentation of only the essential information without loss of scene content. These new techniques can be integrated with wide field of view display components to present information from a wide field of view at minimum power, essential to helmet-mounted systems. The integrated display/processor not only presents information to the user, but also integrates functions to reduce workload, increase the situational awareness and enhance the ability to perform essential tasks. In military display applications, a wide field of view combined with the flexibility to perform multiple functions, and elimination of display artifacts that detract from image quality, are essential to user acceptance of the technology. The display technology must have a fast response time so that the image is free of artifacts due to target movement or head–movement. Frame update rate of at least 60 Hz minimizes image artifacts and blurring. An innovative feature of the display technology should be the flexibility to integrate inputs from external sources as well as the ability to export selected areas to other sensor systems. The physical configuration of the display must conform to the user with an unobtrusive format, conformal with the helmet, fitting similar to a visor, and with the display configured with optimum binocular overlap to provide high resolution and a contiguous view of displayed information. The brightness should be sufficient to present high contrast information, even in high light ambient environments. Also, the physical configuration must be such that illumination from the display is visible only to the user and keeps the system convert. Applications include aviation and ground applications.

The GPS signal is subject to a variety of potential degradations, such as path loss (e.g., foliated or indoor environments), multipath (e.g., urban canyon or in-building), and interference (intentional or unintentional—the weak GPS signal is more vulnerable than other radio links such as the network). There are also a number of situations in which a group of GPS users may operate together in a denied or degraded GPS environment. Using the traditional GPS receiver approach, individual or all users may be denied the ability to navigate in such an environment, even though each user may be intermittently receiving useful satellite signal information. Collectively, the network of GPS users may be able to receive sufficient satellite signals, augmented by intra-network ranging measurements, in order to form a joint position determination. In addition, such a network of receivers represents a spatially diverse distributed aperture which may be capable of obtaining gain and interference mitigation. Additional mitigation is possible if one or more nodes samples the environment with an antenna array. This topic will address distributed GPS position and navigation techniques that mitigate denied or degraded tactical RF environments.

Conventional electro-chemical batteries are often used in powering the sensor electronics including components for wireless communication, and therefore, their finite power capacity has also become a major limitation in deploying them in the battlefield for unattended operations for a long duration. Therefore, it has led to an increasing demand for harvesting electrical energy from ambient vibrations in the surrounding environment using electromechanical transducers based on electromagnetic, electrostatic, or piezoelectric effects. Among them piezoelectric power generators are the most applicable to miniaturized sensors because of their great potential in achieving high power densities using novel nanoscale materials and structures. The current technology is limited to a handful of nanostructures made of piezoelectric materials such as ZnO with potential output power densities of 80 mW/m2. Requirements for future systems may dictate higher power densities beyond these values for powering miniaturized (< 1 mm3) sensors. The goal of this effort is to take advantage of advances in nanofabrication technologies to develop possible advanced materials and/or novel nano structures with efficient mechanical-to-electrical power coupling through the optimization of physical and geometrical configurations to yield power densities with magnitudes several orders of higher than the current technologies. A power harvesting component will be developed that is applicable to a system that would include miniaturized (< 1 mm3) sensors equipped with electronics components for wireless data transmission. Furthermore, the components to be developed should be capable of being used for ruggedized construction for use in battlefield scenarios such as mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV’s) and/or unmanned ground vehicles (UGV’s) in extreme environments.

PBGs can be one-, two-, or three-dimensional in nature, and they are generally endowed with a simple property: near the photonic band edge light becomes highly localized inside one type of layer in one dimension, or near a hole or defect in two or three dimensions, and its amplitude is strongly enhanced as energy is stored inside the device. In many ways this amplification process is reminiscent of a magnifying lens placed in the path of the incoming light, but without the need for the lens. While this property has been applied to the development of delay lines and nonlinear optical parametric amplifiers for wavelength conversion, for example, little or no attention has been devoted to the research and development of linear devices capable of converting the sun’s rays to usable electrical energy. The development of photovoltaics is turning into a key challenge in the field of renewable energy research, attracting the combined attention of optics and electronics communities. Among several power-generation technologies, photovoltaics has the least impact on the environment, and it is probably the most reliable solution for fuel supply and carbon emission problems. The operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell is simple: photons from sunlight reach an absorbing material where electron-hole pairs are generated. Opposite charge carriers can undergo separation, drift or diffusion phenomena, while electrodes provide the flow of the generated-current. While first generation [1] PV cells were made by mono or multi-crystalline silicon p-n junctions, reaching efficiencies of the order of 20%, second generation [2] PV cells are based on thin-film technology. The aim of the latter effort is reduce costs compared to first generation devices, but also to preserve at least the same efficiencies by exploiting low-cost and highly absorbing materials such as CdTe and CuIn(Ga)Se2 (CIGS), for example. Optical and carrier losses in PV cells include: (a) reflections at the top surface of the cell; (b) sub-bandgap losses in the infra-red range, where photons do not have enough energy to raise the electron to the conduction band; (c) thermalization losses due to high energy photons whose extra-energy heats the cell through phonon interactions; (d) effects of electron-hole pairs recombination due to poor material and interface quality. Third-generation [2] PV cells aim to break these limits in order to achieve high efficiency devices, while maintaining low production costs. At present, the approaches of third generation technology include multi-junction PV cells, based on GaInP/GaAs/Ge devices, dye-sensitized and polymer-based PV cells, and concentrators PV. Among third generation techniques, plasmonics represents a promising tool for the design of low-cost, high-efficiency PV cells [3]. More generally, light-matter interactions in the presence of metal nanoparticles, combined with the ability of metal-dielectric structures to support surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) excitations and to enhance the local field in principle enable the possibility of shaping the flow of light in sub-wavelength spaces. It has been demonstrated that properly designed metal-dielectric photonic band gap structures constitute highly transparent electrodes in spite of large amount of metal [4], that can also support SPPs [5]. The optical properties of metals thus provide a new tool in the control and the localization of light within distances well below the light wavelength, thus enabling a host of novel devices.",551,3644,1,No,No,No,,Conduct a feasibility analysis of a photovoltaic cell based on photonic band bap structures.

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has become the signature wound of the War on Terror, accounting for a larger percentage of casualties in the current conflict than in previous ones. A significant portion of these combat-related TBI are ‘closed brain’ injuries, resulting from exposure to blast-related concussive forces that leave little or no external markers of the internal brain injuries. Consequently, these injuries often go undiagnosed until long after the traumatic event, with debilitating and life-threatening symptoms occurring days, weeks or even years following the primary brain injury (1). This ‘secondary damage’ results from biochemical processes that activate within minutes or hours after the primary injury (2,3), underscoring the importance of detecting TBI as soon after primary injury as possible in order to prevent long term damage or even death. While computed axial tomography (CT) scans are considered the ‘gold standard’ for detecting head related injuries, CT scanning technology is difficult to use in the combat environment, given the large infrastructure requirements for operation (power, technicians, physical footprint). An alternative diagnostic method exploits the changes in intracranial dynamics that result from the concussive forces that lead to TBI. Specifically, elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is often the most direct, initial result of concussive force related head injuries (4). Because of the unique neuro-anatomy of the eye, elevated ICP results in dilation of the optic nerve sheath, increasing its diameter (5-7). Ultrasonographic methods, applied directly – and externally – over either or both eyes reliably detect these changes (6-9) and provide a novel and more efficient approach to rapidly identifying deep or bilateral traumatic brain injuries compared to other currently available technologies. The results of this effort will be an ultrasound-based sensor that has sensitivity and specificity for detecting elevated ICP resulting from TBI equivalent to the current CT gold standard with a form factor similar to a standard hand-held personal data assistant. The sensor should function across the wide range of harsh operating environments typical of combat, and should be intuitive and easy to use by medical technicians working under conditions of high stress typical of battlefield environments. Mixed-technology solutions that combine additional detection capabilities with the core ultrasound-based approach to improve either diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, or both are encouraged.",384,2659,1,No,No,No,,Develop preliminary design concept and determine feasibility of an ultrasound-based intracranial pressure detection tool for use in the operational setting. The final report must include system performance metrics and plans for Phase II. This plan should include an approach for developing a calibration procedure to account for variability of cerebral perfusion pressure across individuals. Optimizing per-unit cost will be considered a critical performance metric. Phase II plans should include key component technological milestones and plans for at least one operational test and evaluation. Phase I should also include the processing and submission of all required human subjects use protocols.,"Develop a prototype ultrasound-based sensor technology to detect TBI based on the preliminary design from Phase I. All appropriate engineering testing will be performed, and a critical design review will be performed to finalize the design. Emphasis will be placed upon prototype functionality and accuracy across multiple individuals with diverse baseline and trauma-induced pressure assessments. Phase II deliverables will include: (1) a working prototype of the sensor, including individual calibration capability, (2) drawings and specifications for its construction, and (3) test data on its performance collected in one or more operational settings using human participants. Target TRL: 7","This sensor will have broad application in military as well as commercial settings. Military applications of this technology include enabling medics and corpsmen, as well as non-medically trained military personnel, to direct limited medical resources to those most in need. Commercial applications include providing a similar capability to first responders to conduct on-site triage, reducing or eliminating entirely the need for more costly and time consuming CT scans in a hospital setting. Sensor applications may also extend beyond detecting TBI to diagnosing wounds involving other organs like the liver, kidneys, and abdomen, as well as damage to muscles and tendons.",1,"16 October 2008.; Park E., Bell J.D., Baker A.J.

A key component of this ability is the flexibility, speed, and strength of our hands to manipulate our environment. Replicating this ability in robotic systems will allow many manual tasks to be delegated to robots and free up human resources for more complicated work that machines are unable to perform. Recent trends in robotic development have improved multifingered hand technologies, but experiments performed tend to focus on one aspect of performance and do not address the full range of capabilities of a human hand. These capabilities include dexterity, maneuverability, speed, and precision. The robotic hand/eye prototype system capabilities will be measured by performing the following tasks during Phase II. The goal is to perform all of the tasks to demonstrate a general ability, but completing a subset of the tasks is acceptable for Phase II. Task 1: Type on a Keyboard (Maneuverability) The robotic system will be presented with a standard QWERTY keyboard (usually 101-104 keys). The robotic system will be given an input string of text and commanded to type the text on the keyboard. The goal of the system is to type at the government standard of 40 words per minute [8], based on a 5 minute sample with three or fewer errors. Task 2: Play a Drum (Speed) The robotic system will be presented with a hand drum (10”-16” diameter) and a musical sequence in the Dumbek Rhythm [9,10] format. The rhythms will be played using a variable musical time signature, i.e. 4/4, 6/8 or 12/8. The goal of the system is to play the musical beats with accuracy indistinguishable from a musical recording to the human ear. Task 3: Juggle balls (Dexterity) The robot will be presented with two balls. Its task will be to juggle one or two balls, on demand, with one or two of its hands. The goal is for the system to not drop the ball during 2 minute timed trials. Task 4: Use Hand Tools (Precision) The robot will randomly be presented with either a hammer, a saw, or a pencil. It should hammer a nail into wood, cut a board, or write a sentence on paper according to the tool presented. The robot will complete the task within 2 minutes. Task 5: Thread a needle (Precision) The robot will be presented with a standard needle, thread, and scissors. Its task will be to thread the needle within 1 minute. This task requires a high precision visual sensor system with depth perception. Algorithms should detect the case when the needle fails to thread, then cut the thread, and retry.

Software distribution solutions are also sought to support these new products and their use by the currently underserved DoD supply chain community.,"A number of studies, funded by NSF, DOE and DARPA over the past four years on the importance of high performance computing (HPC) for government, academic and private communities, have highlighted both the benefits and challenges for the end user. A number of these reports were coordinated by the Council on Competitiveness and are available at www.compte.org/hpc These studies highlighted the major barriers to HPC adoption, including budget constraints, lack of access to HPC hardware and software, and lack of access to internal HPC experts to provide this knowledge. Despite the productivity and innovation gains that some major DoD vendors have realized using HPC for advanced modeling and simulation, most of the lower-tier suppliers of subsystems and components for major systems have not made the transition to this technology. The ""desktop-only” shortcuts taken by these defense suppliers have introduced an innovation drag on major DoD systems. The advanced problems that desktop systems cannot solve today represent lost opportunities for these suppliers to power ahead of the global competition. If, over time, these ""desktop-only” firms cannot meet more complex requirements — and meet them at a faster pace — they will place themselves, the defense systems providers who rely on them, and the nation in jeopardy. The focus of this SBIR is to address the challenge of broadening the engagement or use of HPC by tier 2-3 supply chain manufacturers, small business, consulting firms, and emerging independent software vendors. Today these supply chain companies are not benefiting from the use of HPC computing and today’s sophisticated application software to the same degree as the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Increasing the supply of tailored digital analysis computing software applications and improved software accessibility will help reduce the barriers of use. Considerations of the following challenge areas are important; 1. Development of new digital analysis computing software applications that have both commercial and DoD relevance. 2. Development of software applications with domain specific portals to address the need to support the expert domain specialist (e.g. welding engineer) who is not a software or HPC expert. 3. Software application distribution solutions that may host the above-developed software and increase the availability and lower the barriers to use by the underserved DoD supply chain users (e.g tier 2-3). DoD unique requirements such as ITAR controlled software and data also need to be considered.

Currently, the time and cost of integrating heterogeneous data resources is a barrier to superior knowledge of the urban battlespace. New technologies (e.g., machine learning, data model alignment, and data spaces) have potential to enable integration and exploitation of data sources faster and without specialized database expertise. DARPA is interested in developing a Database Translator (DATALATOR) device that semi-automatically integrates heterogeneous battlefield information sources for the urban warfighter. The rapid integration of battlefield data sources will increase operational tempo and improve mission effectiveness. The DATALATOR is envisioned as a standalone appliance that either interfaces with multiple data sources (federated database approach) or stores multiple data sources locally (data warehouse approach) and performs three basic functions. Source Modeling will identify data formats and extract semantic models from diverse data sources. Alignment and Mapping will find semantic correspondence between data entities and relations from diverse sources. Data Transformation will translate multiple source data into integrated views and executes warfighter queries across the diverse sources. The focus of the DATALATOR research will be structured text data sources (e.g., relational databases, XML databases, RDF/OWL databases, and spreadsheets). Research in foreign language translation or sensor/image/video data integration is not considered in scope. Offerors should focus on approaches that address the following issues: 1) Highly automated mapping. The DATALATOR must be usable by relatively untrained personnel. These personnel must be able to influence the behavior of its basic functions without knowledge of the mechanisms employed; that is, using only surface (domain relevant) information. Making use of machine learning techniques to automatically capture patterns and semantics of user actions is relevant here. 2) Bounded mapping effort. DATALATOR integration schemes are to be considered ephemeral. That is, the alignment, mapping, and transformation efforts can be taken to have resource constraints on time and quality of answer produced. Implicit is that the longer a given source is of utility, the more effort may be spent on improving integration quality for that source. 3) Bounded answer scope. The warfighter may only be concerned with answers to a constrained set of questions. DATALATOR will act as a ""savant” providing specific answers. Presumably, it would be simpler to generate mappings that satisfy fewer constraints entailed by a more restricted access to data under the integration scheme. 4) Bounded answer quality. The warfighter may be concerned not with optimal answers but answers that meet certain criteria for adequacy. Therefore the DATALATOR should be able to deliver ""good enough” answers (e.g. an approximate location of an object).",455,3202,1,No,No,No,,"Investigate viability and design approaches for DATALATOR technology.

However, current UAV platforms cannot address the persistent surveillance needs associated with wide area search missions requiring long-endurance monitoring (>6 months) of highly disparate areas of interest spread over large geographic regions. Augmenting UAV sensor payloads with advanced unattended ground sensor (UGS) systems has the potential to enable these missions, especially in difficult environments in which line of sight is limited from overhead assets due to mountainous terrain and foliage. This program will combine the benefits of the long-term, persistent surveillance capabilities of UGS with the high resolution, overhead sensing and target tracking capabilities of today’s advanced UAV platforms. The integrated UAV-UGS system concept would aim to provide the warfighter with the ability to persistently monitor critical, remote areas (i.e. choke points, caves, etc.) in complex clutter using UGS platforms distributed over large geographic regions. A key capability would be the ability to handoff target ID, images and localization information from UGS systems to loitering UAV assets for supporting further target engagement.

In 1843 physicists Ohm and von Helmholtz, using experiments based on pure tones, proposed Fourier spectrum analysis to explain how the ear hears tones with different pitches and established what became known as ""Ohm’s Acoustic Law”. Shortly thereafter, Seebeck saw that the real-world sound environment was composed mostly of impulsive, random signals, not pure tones. So he began to experiment with impulsive wave-shaped signals. He then published his ingenious ""missing fundamental"" experiment, which spectrum theory has yet to explain – but his findings were rejected by Ohm and Helmholtz. Ohm’s Acoustic Law is now known to be not quite true, though contemporary auditory theory continues to rely primarily on Fourier spectrum analysis to explain how the ear hears tones with different pitches. From both fundamental principles and experimental research over some 160 years, Fourier-type theory has demonstrated its inability to explain how the biological ear is able to ""hear everything and listen to anything” even under the most challenging environmental conditions. There has been no useful model yet that can emulate that holy grail of auditory research, the ear’s ability to handle the cocktail party effect.

Batteries of the systems cannot be replaced due to location (enemies region) or due to geographical regions. Future remotely located systems will require energy scavenger technology which gathers energy from the environmental radiation, covering from UV to long wave infrared (LWIR) to operate the system or recharge the batteries when necessary. Photons (e.g. radiation) are a good source of energy for scavenging. Light is available to be harvested from sunlight, lighted buildings and infrared radiation. Remotely located systems with energy scavenging capability can derive enough energy during the day to store or recharge the batteries. At night there are still multiple sources of energy available. There is a small amount of light from night glow that could be made up of starlight and moonlight on clear nights.

Highly linear amplifiers are critical in the RF front-end processing of communication, radar, electronic warfare and other sensor systems. Traditionally, linear amplifiers are designed to trade off improved linearity against higher power dissipation. Therefore, the linear figure of merit (LFOM) of RF amplifiers, which is defined as the ratio of the output third intercept point (OIP3) and the power consumption (PDC), is typically less than ten. Recently, a few revolutionary technical approaches to improve the LFOM have been reported. For example, a novel wideband amplifier design employing ultra-fast transistors in a classical negative feedback topography resulted in ultra high linearity without a power penalty. To improve RF amplifiers at the device level, nanowire-based transistors have recently been predicted to have much higher linearity characteristics than other traditional devices and require much reduced bias voltage as well. This is fundamentally due to the combination of the unique one dimensional (1D) transport properties and the 1D density of states of electrons in the transistor channel. Thus, nanowire-based transistors are potentially promising building blocks for future highly linear RF circuits. To date, nanowire devices and circuits have been reported in different material systems, such as carbon nanotubes, silicon, and compound semiconductors.

Applications include locating and tracking individual targets over a wide field of view and at long range, maintaining track through obscurants and defilade, dealing with multiple targets simultaneously, and navigation, especially for small air and ground vehicles. In each of these applications, the sensor figures-of-merit are related to resolution, signal to noise, detection range and spectral resolution, within the volume and size constraints of the platform. Conventional FPAs are limited in their capability to meet all performance metrics within a small size and weight package. This is primarily due to the use of relatively large size detectors and a limited number of spectral detection bands, with a major deficiencies being the detector configuration and the architecture of the readout integrated circuit. The objective of this program is to develop an innovative sensor architecture that has an adaptable resolution capability, and multi-color spectral sensitivity similar to the human eye, and with on-focal plane processing to optimize the spatial resolution and spectral bands to maximize information extraction from the scene The program addresses a focal plane architecture which is designed to leverage biological analogs and recent progress in flat optics.

Such facilities can be used to conceal threats to the U.S. National Security and illegal activities. Investigations are on-going with several geophysical methods to detect tunnels. These include acoustics, seismics, electromagnetics, gravity gradiometry, and tellurics. Telluric currents are the movement of electric currents in the ground or sea resulting from natural causes as well as human activity. The frequencies applicable to underground imaging can fall below 10kHz. The challenge to operating at such low frequencies is that the energy, either for active illumination as well as receiving, cannot be readily directed under traditional antenna theory. A transmitting antenna system in this frequency domain using standard antenna designs would be sufficiently large as to inhibit operational utility . A dipole at 1 kHz would have an antenna length of 150 km. (For example, see U.S. patent 3,806,944, which describes an aircraft VLF/LF frequency diversity transmitting antenna). A typical receiving antenna at these frequencies is a magnetic loop which is smaller but has low gain and poor directionality and often requires significant loading (For example, see U.S. Patent 6,600,458, which describes an ELF/VLF magnetic loop antenna). Lacking the ability to direct energy, current commercial practice recovers spatial resolution at low frequencies by using measurements at multiple geographic points to decouple the originating underground sources. Operationally, DARPA visualizes the injection of RF energy from an airborne platform to illuminate an underground area of interest. The RF would stimulate telluric currents which would be measured from the same airborne platform. An advanced ELF-VLF antenna system would be used in both transmit and receive modes. DARPA is seeking innovative solutions for advanced antenna design and materials that enable the design and prototyping of a small, directional transmitting-receiving antenna capable of operating in the frequency range form from 1 Hz to 100 kHz. The antenna would have directivity or gain, small size (less than 1 meter in any dimension), high antenna efficiency (considering all losses from transmitter through antenna radiation), narrow beamwidth, highly positive forward to back ratio, and be capable of supporting a nominal 1000 watts input power. Trade-offs between antenna design parameters and the application of new materials and antenna designs should yield acceptable solutions. (For example, see U.S. Patent 6,888,511, which describes an approach to reducing the physical size needed for resonance; U.S. Patent 7,486,242, which describes an antenna consisting of a multilevel structure combined with multilevel and/or space filling ground-plane for microwave antennas; U.S. Patent 6,452,553, which describes an antenna includes at least one element whose physical shape is at least partially defined as a second or higher iteration deterministic fractal; and U.S. Patent 6,958,735, which describes a volumetrically compact and efficient antenna.)",457,3145,1,No,No,No,,"Design a concept for an advanced ELF-VLF antenna system.

To alter the zoom or focus of the system, imaging lenses need to be mechanically translated. Current rifle-scope solutions require manual actuation (Elcan Spectre DR and Leupold CQT Mark IV) are manually actuated requiring that one hand be removed from the rifle, reducing reaction time. In addition, the scope adds significant weight, over 1.3 lbs, to a rifle. Under the DARPA Bio-Optic Synthetic Systems (BOSS) program, a new adaptive polymer lens has been developed to address this problem. In the polymer lens, an elastomeric polymer is deformed to allow for strain induced focal length change mimicking the human eye. Conventional mechanically translated lenses can now be replaced with a stationary reconfigurable optic. The BOSS lenses can be utilized in a rifle scope to allow for electronic zoom actuation at a reduced weight. Due to the chemical structure of the polymers used in the lenses, they often have nonlinear and chromatic properties that are substantially different from conventional glasses. The dispersive properties of the lens can potentially be manipulated to correct for the chromatic aberration of the human eye, allowing for a rifle scope to create a sharper image than possible with conventional low cost optics.

Follow on efforts must manufacture and test the proposed technologies enabling potential space or renewable energy military applications.","Many established and entrepreneurial companies, universities and laboratories are developing photovoltaic cell and electrical energy storage technology. Solar cell efficiencies around 40% has been demonstrated in the laboratory with multiple growth paths to longer term efficiencies of 50% or more. Similarly, energy storage technology (batteries, fuel cells, and other electrical/mechanical devices) has been demonstrated at 100 to 300 watt-hours/kilogram with potential growth paths promising order of magnitude improvements. However, where most of the above are optimized for terrestrial applications, the goal of this solicitation is to leverage private sector investments to develop photovoltaic and energy storage systems engineered and optimized for the space environment, most likely also having terrestrial applications. For photovoltaic cells the objective shall be demonstrating at least 40 to 50 % efficiency using the AMO solar spectrum with solar concentration encouraged. The use of solar cell concentrators is an important approach to reducing cost and weight while generally increasing efficiency. Solar concentration significantly reduces the solar cell area resulting in lower costs and weight, but requiring operation in a high temperature environment. The Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed program is designing arrays optimized for such extreme environments with solar array concentration ratios of 10 to 100X. The cells must survive at least 20 thirty day orbit transfers through the Van Allen radiation belts with minimal radiation degradation. For energy storage the objective shall be demonstrating greater than 500 watt-hour/kilogram storage and able to survive the space environment including radiation and thermal extremes. More generally, the technologies for both solar cells and energy storage should be designed and analyzed for space launch and on-orbit environments, as well as affordability and manufacturability. The offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding of the component technologies, potential applications and associated benefits/liabilities. Component technology descriptions should include the materials, processes, test and manufacturing approach, including how all efficiencies will be measured. The primary application of interest is improved solar electric arrays for military space systems such as the Fast Access Spacecraft Testbed whose goal is demonstrating a 130 W/Kg specific power. Improved cell efficiencies and energy storage promises to dramatically improve such solar arrays with much higher specific powers and operation through eclipse. Enabled capabilities range from dramatically smaller, more survivable and efficient high power systems to extremely rapid orbit transfer using electric propulsion with efficiencies akin to aircraft today. Other applications should also be identified including both potential terrestrial military (land, air and sea) and commercial renewable energy applications. Secondary benefits of the technologies should also be identified. For example, depending on the approach, radiation and thermally tolerant cells especially in concentrator systems may enable highly survivable solar arrays resistant to directed energy or radiation. Amorphous silicon cells exemplify near radiation immunity, but have efficiencies of only 8.5% resulting in huge solar arrays. Materials offering much higher efficiencies and also radiation resistance or thermal annealing properties during operation would be ideal. Similarly, high thermally tolerant concentrator arrays offer the potential for dramatically reduced cell acreage and dramatically improved affordability for terrestrial commercial applications.",500,3686,1,No,No,No,,"Identify potential applications of the proposed technology.

Current reports suggest that the percentage of subjects meeting screening criteria for major depression, generalized anxiety, or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is about 20 percent after duty in Iraq and more than 10 percent after duty in Afghanistan (1), nearly 3 times the estimated prevalence in the general population (2). Although post-onset treatments for stress-related disorders have shown some success (3), these treatments often require long–term care with significant one-on-one interactions between the Warfighter and clinician. Combined with the personal cost, recent estimates indicate that Warfighter psychological stress injuries could cost the nation up to $6 billion (4). Consequently, successful strategies that protect against combat stress reactivity will provide a critical and timely way to reduce the personal, financial and manpower costs associated with long term, or intense, exposure to military combat operations. There is currently no intervention that effectively inoculates Warfighters against the complex stressors of combat operations. Most, if not all, existing treatment approaches are targeted post-symptom onset and do not attempt to prevent the changes in neural function that lead to the formation of stress related disorders. A more effective and safe approach would be to develop methods that inoculate military personnel against combat stress reactivity before they are affected with these disorders – either prior to exposure to the aggravating stimuli or shortly following such exposure (i.e. post-exposure but pre-onset). Since there are likely many factors contributing to the neuropsychological changes underlying stress disorders, a multi-modal approach to providing this combat resilience should be most effective. Consequently, potential solutions would combine neuro-pharmacological approaches that either inoculate against the damaging neural effects of stress pre-traumatic exposure (6) or prevent the harmful changes in neural function post-traumatic exposure (7) with cognitive approaches that emphasize resilience-building interventions like controlled stress exposure (5,8). The results of this effort will be one or more novel intervention(s) that quantifiably reduce the prevalence of combat stress injuries in military personnel. The intervention will be safe, free of short- or long-term health consequences, easily administered prior to, during deployment or immediately following a traumatic event and will significantly reduce stress related disorders across a wide range of operational environments. The intervention will be based on well-defined mechanistic neuroscience principles. Multidisciplinary solutions or solutions that include multimodal approaches are encouraged (e.g. pharmaceutical, bio-behavioral, virtual technology or any combination thereof.).",401,2963,1,No,No,No,,"Prepare a feasibility study on one or more inoculations of stress related disorders for use in the operational setting.

Many problems with far-reaching consequences for our country and national security remain unsolved today even though the conceptual knowledge necessary to solve them is latent in our populace. We can point to several reasons for this. Deep conceptual knowledge of leading-edge science is compartmentalized because many important problems (e.g., unified field theory) are restricted to the purview of a small set of qualified domain specialists. Also, some of these problems or their final resolution must be kept secret for purposes of national security, which significantly limits the scope of potential contributors. Furthermore, the most challenging problems (e.g., global warming, population growth, energy, etc.) are multifaceted, such that solving one facet of the problem (e.g., climate) may create one or more new problems (e.g., economic, societal, etc.). But perhaps the most consequential impediment to solving these problems is that very large groups of distributed people with common goals do not self-organize effectively due to complex logistical and sociological factors. However, the burgeoning popularity of online communities (e.g., Facebook, MySpace, Orkut, Habbo, Friendster, etc) and growing successes of distributed computing projects (e.g., Einstein@Home, Rosetta@home, Malaria Control, SIMAP, etc) raises the question of whether or not these two Internet phenomena can be merged into a problem-solving network that leverages the respective strengths of humans and machines to effectively overcome these barriers to solving complex problems. Such a network would foster synergy by selectively directing collaboration among entities within distinct fields of endeavor while ensuring necessary compartmentalization via problem decomposition and reconstitution. It would ensure multiple constraint satisfaction by ensuring expert contributions that address problems comprehensively from many angles. It would extend the scope of contribution to non-domain experts via sub-problem delegation. And it would extend the scope of contribution to classified initiatives by reformulating problems to remove identifiable, domain-specific problem characteristics that aren’t relevant to generating a solution. Therefore, the goal of this research is to integrate the powerful creative, inductive, and deductive capabilities of myriad human agents via an effective automated organizational system that is robust to bias and supplants a sociological infrastructure with an optimizing delegation system. Such a system would likely have the ability to selectively employ human ""nodes” to a lesser or greater extent depending upon the historical performance of each node in solving particular classes of problems (this is analogous to back -propagation of error in neural network theory). Furthermore, such a system would delegate sub problems to these human agents that could be pieces of a goal problem or meta-tasks relevant to solving the goal problem, such as reformulation, decomposition, reconstitution, generating agent-selection heuristics, or evaluating candidate solutions. Sub problems would be stripped of domain-specific characteristics that are not relevant to their solution.

A key component of this ability is the flexibility, speed, and sensitivity of our hands to manipulate our environment. Replicating this ability in robotic systems will allow many manual tasks to be delegated to robots and free up human resources for more complicated work that machines are unable to perform. Recent trends in robotic development have improved multifingered hand technologies, but the focus tends to be on grasping rather than the sensory and force feedback capabilities of human skin and muscles. In particular, human skin and muscles are capable of determining texture, weight, and estimating object properties based on touching and manipulating an object blindly. Under this program, a prototype robotic hand system, including skin and muscles (actuators), will be developed. This system should be measured by its performance on object recognition tasks in which the robot will be presented with several objects that vary in their physical characteristics, e.g. a block of wood, a brick, a stuffed animal, and a feather, and asked to select the appropriate object from the set using its skin and muscles to make the determination, without any visual cues. The robotic skin and muscle system should have similar size, weight, and flexibility characteristics as a human hand and arm system, and include a five finger assembly which fits into a standard large work glove. Sensitivity regions should cover as much of the hand as possible. The fingers should include multiple joints to be able to grasp and hold aloft different objects. The hardware design for the robotic hand and arm system should contain a simple socket interface with a minimum number of connections to accommodate a versatile set of mobility platforms. The software control algorithms should include a simple, understandable, well documented software development kit (SDK) for programming the hand and eye system. This SDK will allow experienced software programmers to quickly prototype applications to control the robot, and ease its commercial and military adoption.",336,2139,1,No,No,No,,"Design a robotic hand system, focusing on the skin and muscles for tactile and force feedback information to be relayed to a central processor, and focusing on physical components, sensor system, and software design.

Advances in anti-satellite technologies have highlighted the vulnerability of these critical links [1]—existing satellites have little or no defensive capabilities, and are controlled largely through slow, ground-based operations centers that cannot react quickly to rapidly-evolving situations. On-board autonomy will be a critical element in any future satellite defense capability—space systems must meet tight response times to detect and respond to threats and opportunities. A key autonomy function will be the ability to plan and execute defensive actions in real-time, avoiding or defeating threats as they occur. However, developing a comprehensive planning and execution system is very difficult due to the complexity of spacecraft systems and their environment, the range of threats and opportunities, the small timescales involved, the limited onboard computational resources, and the potential harm which can result if incorrect actions are performed. Space applications are particularly complicated by inherently non-renewable resources such as fuel and one-shot devices. Autonomy systems must be verifiably correct and timely, so that their operations can be trusted with critical decision-making [4]. To date, autonomous systems that have flown in space have been highly customized to individual missions, have focused largely on science objectives [2] and maintenance [3], not defense, and have little of the verifiable, high-speed planning and response capabilities required [5,6]. This topic seeks to develop and demonstrate a robust, reliable, verifiable approach to on-board satellite autonomy, emphasizing technologies to perform response planning and action execution.

Coalition operations will require the ability for diverse command teams to work together and coordinate across differences in doctrine, training, and standard operating procedures. To function effectively in this diverse rapidly changing environment, tomorrow’s command centers must be collaborative—able to communicate effectively in order to adapt their behavior appropriately as a mission unfolds. Technology is needed to automatically and unobtrusively obtain data to compute measures of effective collaborative performance. Data will be used to compute leading indicators of command center performance—providing the command team with real time awareness of whether their collaboration is succeeding or failing, and indicating when, where, and how they should change their collaborative behavior to improve their effectiveness. Technology for automated sensing of collaborative performance may come from any of several research areas. For example, natural language processing technology can analyze communications data from text messages, chat, and transcribed verbal communications to identify communication patterns that are associated with effective team performance (Gorman et al., 2003). Digital sensors worn like ID badges can serve as ""sociometers” (Pentland, 2008) that analyze location, physical proximity, tone of voice, and other factors that may be associated with effective collaboration. Psychophysiological and neurophysiological data have the potential to reveal patterns in individual cognitive processing that are associated with effective collaboration (Schmorrow and Kruse, 2004). Proposers need not be limited by this list, but must make the case as to how their proposed senor technology will detect patterns in human performance that are associated with effective collaboration among a diverse distributed command team.

In addition, targeting capabilities need to be established such that the foveated zoom can be arbitrarily and rapidly directed to anywhere in the 360° scene.","Increasing demands on the soldier for situational awareness require optical imaging techniques to gather information over large fields of view. An urgent need is emerging for future military optical imaging systems to be able to perform foveation on a scene, i.e. there is a need to be able rapidly zoom into one and in some cases multiple areas of a scene simultaneously without losing overall contextual information. This is especially true in urban areas where at least 360° × 20° coverage is required. The current state of the art foveation schemes are becoming vastly inadequate in meeting current and future size, weight, and power requirements, because they either utilize gimbals (moving lenses mechanically) and/or incorporate multiple cameras. Any single imager Wide Field of View (WFOV) foveation device that incorporates gimbals is very expensive in terms of power, weight, size, and speed, and most importantly, suffers from situational awareness issues (cannot see the whole scene and a foveated image at the same time). Multiple camera solutions are problematic in that size, power and cost scale directly with the number of imagers and high resolution data is captured at all times even in areas of low interest, which greatly increases the computational overhead. In order to meet the requirements for practical use in a military environment, the proposed device will need to achieve the following specifications: • Field of view: 360° × 20° (or greater) • Foveated image acquisition time: < 100 ms with 30 ms desired • Foveated image resolution: 50% MTF @ 400 lp/mm • Magnification of 10X of the foveated portion of image There are numerous approaches which may be developed to achieve the desired specifications for a next generation 360 degree foveated imaging system.

This enables high speed, high directivity portable links. Applications of interest to the military include: - High directivity, wideband links with enhanced immunity to electronic countermeasures which can be used from either stationary or moving platforms. - Compact, hand held or helmet mounted and binocular systems for wideband transmission of ultra high resolution surveillance data - High precision/high selectivity sensor networks (man-to-man, man-to-equipment, equipment-to-equipment) - Combined optical/millimeter wave (MMW) diversity technique for high availability LOS free space links - High resolution scanning and targeting Existing commercial MMW implementations use small form factor, mid- power MMW generators based on solid-state IMPATT and/or GUNN diodes in high precision resonant cavities. These cavities essentially make them non-tunable, difficult to modulate and create serious challenges for high density integration of component chains on integrated circuits using VLSI techniques. This leads to higher cost and larger physical footprints. These systems currently operate at 1.25 Gbps over distances around 100 m to 1 km at fixed frequencies in the 94 GHz and 72 GHz bands; and 10 m to 50 m in the 60 GHz band. Some R&D systems have begun to demonstrate data throughput up to 10 Gbps attempting to reach distances up to 500 m. Future portable/mobile military MMW equipment may have to become multifunctional and be able to utilize frequency bands in an agile, flexible manner. This may be due to growing network congestion or more likely to enable agile switching between applications optimized in diverse frequency bands. For example, the large range of atmospheric attenuation over the millimeter wave bands allows an agile user to flip between higher attenuation short range applications or lower attenuation, longer range applications like rapid deployment of high speed access links. Also, more widespread application of cognitive radio techniques has frequency agility as a prerequisite. Techniques for small footprint portable MMW transmitter that will enable broad tunability over the frequency range of 30 GHz-120 GHz with a path to extend the range to 300 GHz are desired. The transmission distance for the low attenuation bands should be >1km with a path to achieving 5km. The net MMW transmit power should be >+10 dBm with a path to >30 dBm. Antenna gains of ~50 dBi are required. Data rates up to 10 Gbps are targeted.",396,2599,1,No,No,No,,"Design of a widely tunable 30-120 GHz MMW generator which also has >10dBm output power.

Modern biological agents are effective in very low doses; thus, there is a growing need for bio-sensors with an excellent combination of sensitivity, probability of correct detection, and low false positive rate. Additionally, the need for portable rapid detection systems in many applications requires that these sensors have superior size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. One promising approach to developing sensors with improved detection and SWaP characteristics is by exploiting integrated chip-scale sensors. This topic seeks novel approaches to developing integrated chip-scale sensors to detect and classify bio-agents with superior detection and SWaP performance. There is a wide variety of potential pathogens and classes of pathogens that may be considered – with each threat potentially having unique or specific means for sensing and metrics for evaluation and processing. Proposals for any well-motivated threat detection environments will be considered, including water- and air-borne pathogens, as well as those that are detectible in human products. Consequently, this topic is not specific to any particular type of threat, but rather is open to any well-motivated combination of threat and assay approach that utilizes integrated chip-scale technology to achieve dramatic performance enhancements in speed and portability. Proposals should therefore first identify bio-agent threat types where the proposed integrated chip-scale sensor technology can be applied. Proposals should then present a novel bio-sensor design that can out-perform current state-of-the-art sensors in detection and SWaP characteristics for the bio-agent threat type of interest. Performance metrics for the new sensor technology should be proposed that are specific to the threat and that exceed the current state-of-the-art. In an effort to guide proposals to this topic, below is an example set of a proposed bio-agent threat and detection metrics. This set is meant to be illustrative only – proposals should present their own metrics specific to the bio-agent threats they address: Sensitivity of better than 10 pM; Scalability to achieve parallel detection throughput > 100,000; Detection specificity better than 0.9 @ low throughput (~10) and better than 0.995 at high throughput (~10,000); Speed of operation ~ 1-100 msec at high concentrations of analyte; Volume of analyte, < 1 nl; operation of the sensor microsystem with false positives rate better than 1/week @ 1000 samples/week; ability to operate with dynamic monitoring @ sampling rate better than 100 samples/sec; Sensor power consumption < 100 mW, volume < 50 inch¬3 and weight < 5 pounds for high throughput operation.",416,2836,1,No,No,No,,"Complete a conceptual design and demonstrate feasibility of biosensor system for biological threat agent detection.

Applications include machine vision, solar blind imaging, and in chemical and biological applications for detection of surface residues and biological agents. In these applications the generation of high quality images, with characteristics comparable to commercial imaging technology will enhance the utilization of ultraviolet imaging. This program leverages recent advances in UV sensitive material and detector technology, and focuses on UV imaging focal plane array technology through optimization of the detector design and development of design concepts for the integration of UV detector arrays with state of the art read-out electronics for imaging. The high resolution inherent in UV imaging can be enhanced through development of an array technology with small size detectors, an enabling component for megapixel imaging arrays. Pixel size on the order of five microns is the desired goal.

Jet propulsion in unmanned aerial vehicles poses simultaneous challenges of low consumption and fast thrust response. Real-time monitoring and control of such combustion process requires1 near-instantaneous acquisition of its spectral signatures. Similar bursty and explosive processes, while lasting very short time, generate high information volume that needs to be captured in real time. An advanced jet turbine operating at 120,000 rpm generates wideband spectral signature over hundreds of nanometers range; cycle-resolved monitoring of comparable turbine can be performed by narrow-linewidth, continuously tunable source and a single detector device. The combination of very fast, continuously tunable source and high-speed detector is capable of spectral information rates exceeding those of the conventional spectrometers by at least an order of magnitude2. Spatially resolved techniques such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), provide real-time analysis in medical, manufacturing and sensing applications and critically depend on the performance of continuously tunable source3: OCT resolution is a direct function of source tuning speed and source linewidth. Advanced source3 relies on mechanical scanning and is capable of millisecond-scale tuning over 70nm, while maintaining the linewidth of 15GHz. While the source represents significant improvement over the past technology, the micrometer resolution barrier still remains. More importantly, new devices must be devised in order to address packaging and power consumption compatible with SWAP parameters expected from the field or ultraportable units. The new tuning technology must offer high figure of merit that combines large tuning speed, narrow linewidth and wide spectral range. The new development must overcome the basic obstacle set by interdependence of source linewidth and achievable tuning speed: while the source tuning must be slower than the cavity lifetime, its linewidth is inversely proportional to the cavity lifetime. Any new development thus must overcome this technological barrier to provide source that simultaneously possesses fast tuning speed and narrow linewidth over practically useful spectral range. Recent demonstration of tuning and linewidth-impairing mechanisms have demonstrated new path towards the construction of fast tunable sources. However, significant practical challenges remain on path to deployable technology: Effective tuning range decoupling from linewidth and scan speed in practical source design; Practically useful power output scaling that is independent on tuning speed, source linewidth or operational spectral range. If the practical design successfully decouples the tuning range, speed and linewidth, the resulting device would provide unfettered access to real-time acquisition of fast and explosive processes and provide in-vivo insight into biological microsystems for the first time.

Although these threats are being addressed by the initiation of new sensor development programs, which employ sensitive detection methods and sophisticated analysis capabilities, the result is that such instruments are large and require the participation of experts for their function and analytical output. In addition, these instruments can only be deployed selectively because of their cost and supporting requirements. There is a need for inexpensive sensors capable of acquiring, analyzing, and rapidly determining the presence of such threats with reasonable certainty of making the correct identification. The choices at present, such as instruments based upon gas chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses are costly and bulky – making ordinary deployment impractical. There is the potential for developing portable hand-held devices exploiting alternative technologies, such as optical scanning and other spectral decomposition methods, which offer opportunities for a cost-effective method for analysis of chemical and biological threats, with reasonably low false-alarm rates. However, novel data processing algorithms will need to be developed for rapid identification of the chemicals and their ongoing reactions - even in low concentrations. These algorithms should analyze plumes in terms of shape, particle size, concentration, fluorescence and other physical and chemical parameters, increasing the probability of detection and decreasing the false alarm rate. In addition, scanning technology and its accompanying image processing techniques must be modified and miniaturized for hand-held deployment.

The ultimate target for barrier performance is a water transmission rate of 1 x 10-6 g/m2/day which can survive a 5% film strain.,"Extremely low gas permeability barriers are needed to prevent diffusion through polymer substrates. For example, the failure of flexible organic electronic devices occurs because O2 and H2O can easily permeate through polymeric packaging materials. These oxidants degrade the light-emitting organics and lead to oxidation of the metal cathode. To reduce permeation of O2 and H2O, inorganic materials have been used to coat the polymer packaging materials to provide a diffusion barrier. Unfortunately, single inorganic films deposited using vacuum-based deposition techniques do not provide an adequate gas diffusion barrier for many applications. At thicknesses above 20 nm the films are stiff and rigid. Below 20 nm, these films allow high transmission rates of oxidants. Typical H2O transmission rates of ~0.05 g/m2/day are observed for single thin films of silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3), which are due to pinholes, particles, and defects innate to the random nature of line-of-sight deposition techniques. In contrast, maximum allowable H2O transmission rates of ~ 1 x 10-6 g/m2/day are required to achieve an OLED lifetime of 10,000 hours. A possible new approach to barrier layer fabrication is Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). Pinhole-free Al2O3 ALD films have been demonstrated and preliminary data suggests Al2O3/Polymer multi-layer barriers with layer thicknesses of <20 nm fabricated by ALD should display unprecedented performance as flexible gas diffusion barriers. The successful development of these new hybrid Al2O3/Polymer multi-layers would disrupt current technology and enable flexible gas diffusion barriers on polymer substrates. Further, ALD is a non-line-of-sight technique for depositing conformal thin films, which will enable entirely new packaging capabilities. One of the primary considerations in developing this technology will be the cost to produce the barrier. A target cost of less than $1/ft2 for barrier fabrication has been set by the display industry .This goal is not feasible with conventional ALD batch processing. Higher throughput – for example roll-to-roll – ALD deposition technology needs to be developed to significantly reduce the cost of barrier fabrication.",323,2210,1,No,No,No,,"Using ALD or similar revolutionary approach (sputtering will not be deemed revolutionary), produce barrier films on polymer substrates which can survive a 2% substrate strain while providing a transmission rate of at most 1 x 10-3 g/m2/day water.

These interactions are most effective when done in settings where the instructor-to-student ratio is small (2). In the Department of Defense, where training is an ongoing priority for all service-members, maintaining a low student to human instructor ratio is costly. Many attempts have been made to reduce this cost by replacing human instructors with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), which are meant to provide customized instruction independent of human instructors (3). However, current ITSs significantly lag human instructor capability when considered in terms of their ability to consistently demonstrate equivalent learning improvements (4). This disparity between human instructors and ITSs may lie in the degree to which human instructors are able to foster the affective dimension of learning. Affect (5) refers to the attitudes that students have towards learning – e.g. motivation, interest & engagement. Mounting evidence suggests that increased levels of student affect when interacting with human instructors has a significant, positive, impact on the rate with which material is learned (6) as well as the effectiveness of this learning (7). This effect is independent of the level of previous training on the subject material a student may have. Simply put, effective human instructors are able to monitor student affect and tailor their teaching methods to maintain high levels of affect (8); currently, ITSs are not enabled to do this (9). This suggests that one way to improve the overall effectiveness of ITSs is to enable them to characterize student affect and craft instructional content and delivery based on this assessment. Significant research has been done linking facial expressions to different affective states and to exploit these relationships to guide machine responses accordingly (10). The goal of this SBIR is to develop a system that significantly expands these findings to characterize student affective state using a much wider range of such behaviors (eg facial expressions, gestures, tonal inflections) (11,12), to guide an ITS in crafting appropriate instruction based on this assessment. The resulting technology must be platform independent, calibratable to different individuals and transparent to the user.",347,2334,1,No,No,No,,"Develop preliminary design concept and determine technological feasibility of a technology that will enable effective intelligent tutoring by noninvasively detecting a student’s affective state. The final report must include system and user performance metrics and plans for Phase II. Specifically the final report must include: a) a discussion of the different types of behaviors that will be captured to inform this technology, linking them to affective state; b) the tradeoffs and weightings between these behaviors and affective states; c) one or more approaches for developing a calibration procedure to account for variability of different individuals; and, d) an architecture for developing a closed loop, platform independent, system. Optimizing per-unit cost will be considered a critical performance metric. Phase II plans should include preliminary design plans, key component technological milestones and plans for at least one operational test and evaluation. Phase I should also include the processing and submission of all required human subjects use protocols.","Develop a prototype closed loop system based on the preliminary design from Phase I. All appropriate engineering testing will be performed, and a critical design review will be performed to finalize the design. Emphasis will be placed upon prototype functionality and accuracy and the ability to calibrate to individual affective state. Phase II deliverables will include: (1) a working prototype of the technology, including calibration capability, (2) drawings and specifications for its construction, and (3) test data on its performance collected in one or more operational settings.","There are both military and commercial applications for this technology, which will significantly improve the quality of ITS-based training. Target military applications include those whose training relies heavily on computer based training (CBT), or distance learning (DL) approaches, to supplement live instructor based training. It is estimated that within the DoD, if these and similar training technologies could reduce the time to deliver specialized skill training to just half of all personnel by 30%, the resulting cost savings would approach $500M/yr. One key to ensuring this reduction in training time is to enable these systems to more effectively tailor instructional content to individual student needs by assessing student affect. Commercially, there is a large training and education sector currently working to provide computer based training tools to the K-12 student demographic. Incorporating this technology will help make this training more effective by enabling these tools to tailor instructional content to the individual student. As well, the grade school and high school tutoring and standardized exam preparation market heavily relies on computer based training and provides another market for this technology. Finally, non-training applications for this tool include gaming, entertainment and medical rehabilitation – domains in which the ability to gauge users’ affect and tailor content accordingly will lead to more pleasant, engaging and successful experiences.

TBI results from two components, the fast acting primary injury, which includes the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and/or torn, and the slower acting secondary injury, which includes a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma culminating in substantial nerve cell death (2). These secondary processes can become irreversible in as little as 90 minutes resulting in permanent degraded physical performance and impaired cognitive function (3, 4). They dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury (5) and account for the greatest number of chronic TBI cases and TBI deaths (6). The use of therapeutic hypothermia in reducing brain damage following stroke has been well documented (7). Human stroke patients, animal stroke models as well as human aneurysm patients have shown dramatic neuroprotection with moderate degrees of cortical cooling (8, 9). Recent findings suggest that applying this cooling approach to reduce the consequences of secondary injury following TBI will significantly improve the long-term outcome for both cognitive and motor skills (10, 11). While this TBI-related approach is still in its infancy and not yet ready for implementation in combat settings, significant advances have been made in the core technologies underlying this approach (12). The goal of Therapeutic Hypothermia for Treating TBI is to deliver a combat-deployable cooling technology that will extend the golden hour of patient survivability and increase the chances for full recovery once the Warfighter begins receiving advanced medical treatment. Key challenges with using hypothermia to improve wounded warrior survivability following TBI, which are to be addressed in this topic, include: • Developing a closed loop regulatable cooling technology: To help regulate the cooling and to ensure that the treatment itself does not introduce additional damage, novel coolant, coolant delivery technologies and fine resolution real-time feedback metrics and controls must be developed to assist in real-time regulation of the cooling application in a closed loop arrangement. • Determining ideal cooling regimens: There is a tradeoff between absolute cooling temperature, rate at which cooling temperature is attained, time at cooling temperature, location(s) at which cooling is applied and degree of injury progression, which differ across individuals and injury.

The video streams from these aircraft are used to improve situational awareness by ground forces, target recognition and tracking, and, potentially, on-the-fly 3D scene model generation. While the demand for video increases, the size and payload capacity of small UAVs places stringent limitations on system components – including camera hardware, image processors and communications equipment. Unfortunately, the quality of the UAV video is often compromised by motion blur, particularly on smaller, less stable aircraft where payload limitations make precision gimbals impractical. The resulting video makes it difficult to accurately detect and track objects of interest, and lacks the feature detail necessary for deriving meaningful target information. Furthermore, transmitting video to the ground can be bandwidth intensive depending on the image resolution, size and frame rate. These limitations can be mitigated to some extent by stabilization techniques to reduce motion artifacts, compression algorithms to reduce bandwidth and post processing to provide sharper images. But, much better approaches are needed to circumvent these limitations, while at the same time reducing the size/weight/power requirements of the payload. Consequently, technologies are sought that will provide significant improvements in the quality and content of video (reduced motion blur, super-resolution and increased dynamic range) obtained from small UAVs, with an ultimate goal of producing 3D scene models in real time. Possible novel approaches include, but are not limited to : electronically steerable field of view (FOV) optics, high frame rate imagers, high-speed processing and new computationally efficient algorithms. Solutions must be consistent with the very low payload capacity and low power availability of small UAVs such as the Raven and Scan Eagle.",286,1996,1,No,No,No,,"Develop approaches to dramatically reduce the effects of motion blur due to platform instability in small UAV video, while minimizing the transmission bandwidth.

Each of these elements poses its own unique requirements, making more challenging the already difficult tasks of developing strategic, operational, and tactical plans. In particular, the goals of stability and civil support require planners to factor in the cultural and political dynamics of complex societies, forces with which the planners themselves are often only marginally familiar. Domestic political divisions in multi-cultural nation states combine with influences from neighboring nations and trans-national actors to produce dynamics that are difficult to understand, let alone predict. Creating paths to stability in such environments is challenging when the cultural forces and regional actors are familiar and well understood. For military decision makers responsible for developing long and short term plans without the benefit of such insights, it is clear that tools are needed. This topic seeks novel technologies that can be brought to bear upon the problem of analyzing the dynamics of a complex society and gaining insights into the potential effects of policies, plans, and courses of actions in such environments. DARPA is interested in developing tools that can assist military planners and decision makers at any echelon by providing them with the kind of insights that high-level leaders currently have access to via human experts. A wide variety of technical approaches and solutions are envisioned and would be in scope, from networking technologies that can effectively put planners in touch with available experts; to modeling and simulation technologies that allow ""what if” analysis; to innovative information storage and retrieval techniques for acquiring and applying lessons learned. What is essential is that the proposed technology provides a means for a reasonably intelligent non-expert to easily and effectively gain relevant expert-level insight into the potential behavior of a complex, dynamic society. Inasmuch as this topic is focused upon providing advanced understanding to a non-expert, proposals should address practicality issues. Data-driven approaches need to address the availability of data and balance the difficulty of acquiring and inputting data against the value of the output. Similarly, modeling approaches need to address ease-of-use issues, as well as explain how models will be validated. Regardless of the technical approach, offerors need to make a compelling case that, once matured, the proposed technology can be made available to and used by non-specialists with the sort of abilities one would expect to find in senior enlisted men and military staff officers.",418,2835,1,No,No,No,,Establish technical feasibility of proposed approach.

While there are ongoing efforts to integrate various data sources [2, 3, 4], establish graphics standards [5, 6] for overlaying and registering the data onto 2 and 3-D maps, and invoke data analytics [7, 8], comparatively little effort has been assigned to determining how to automatically adapt the display of visual information in a way that is optimized to the user and the types of data that must be displayed. As the military begins to follow the commercial proliferation of handheld devices, and its goal to digitize the battlefield and make every soldier a sensor [9], this problem becomes more acute – the value of visualization is lost if it is too crowded, not relevant, or streams too slowly for the end-user’s device. Thus, an automatic or supervised semi-automatic method is needed to visualize or display the most relevant data in the most effective way for the user, independent of his device or connection. While there is a large body of work on methods for visualizing patterns in data [10], most are not easily adapted to resource-constrained users. Thus, new adaptive visualization technologies are needed that draw on understanding of human perception, visualization, and data overlay techniques [11], etc., such that cognitively and operationally effective geospatial visualizations can be determined on-the-fly, and conveyed to a variety of end-user devices [12]. Inroads in the commercial sector [13] have begun to address this in the display of traffic and map information in handheld devices [14, 15], but this does not take into account the user or his circumstances. This task requires the development of software that ingests standard geospatially tagged data and adapts the output for device-independent visualization. The software should use open standards both for communication and display, and be interoperable syntactically, and semantically. It should also allow the user to mark up or tag data that is visualized on the device. In order to demonstrate adaptability, results should be able to be automatically visualized on at least two different devices with bandwidth connectivity and resolution capabilities that vary on the order of 10x (e.g., a PDA and a laptop). Visualizations should be compatible with an open standard map display. Data input and display should include event or object icons [16], such as Battle Command graphics [17] (e.g., FBCB2 or similar tracks with standard input format – can be simulated at 1s update), and at least two of the following: streaming H.264 video with metadata, textual input (or its’ representation) that has a geospatial component (e.g., logistics and supply information), geospatially tagged text documents or reports, and imagery compressed in MISB standard formats [18]. Testing in Phase II should include interim evaluation by intelligence experts to guide development.",476,3035,1,No,No,No,,"Investigate viability and design approaches for automatic visualization technology. Demonstrate the feasibility of adaptive visualization of data registered to a 2D and/or 3D geospatial display using input types and output display devices listed in the description. Demonstrations can be specific to these cases and not fully automatic, but the results must be generalize-able and support automation. Focus on demonstrating, in a rigorously empirical and quantitative fashion, the capability of the technical approach.","Develop a prototype that demonstrates the efficacy of automatic and adaptive visualization technology based on Phase I results, data, and analysis. Evaluate the performance of the prototype through experimentation on operationally relevant data. All items shall be referenced to or overlaid on the geospatial representation.

Current path-planning systems model, analyze, and account for such critical parameters as terrain, travel time and distance, as well as some categories of potential threats, including terrain-based line-of-sight determination. However, some of the most important path-planning considerations for hostile or uncertain territory are knowledge intensive and too fluid for current systems to model robustly. Examples include identifying terrain or locations that the enemy is likely to use for ambushes, times of day and areas where city streets are most congested, neighborhoods or districts with significant hostile unrest, and dangerous bottlenecks in the patrol area. The effort required to construct and maintain useful predictive models for regional, tactically dependent factors such as these is prohibitive. Worse, the results are brittle, especially as adversaries rapidly adapt to changing tactics, techniques, and procedures. This topic seeks innovative approaches to acquiring and maintaining knowledge that can enable route planners to take considerations like these into account, extending the ability of automatic planners to produce safe and efficient routes well beyond the state-of-the-art. With the ever-growing emphasis on monitoring and collection of data from the battlefield, this topic seeks innovative solutions to improve operational performance in path-planning systems. Solutions that can generate and maintain knowledge without requiring significant human intervention are of particular interest, including creative approaches to automated information gathering, distillation, and presentation. The goal is to find minimally-intrusive techniques for making user experiences transferrable, so that new staff will have access to previously-acquired knowledge that is unavailable in current systems. We seek to leverage the strengths of information systems at gathering, retaining, filtering, and prioritizing large amounts of data to enhance human decision-making. This topic does not seek yet another solution to the general path-planning problem. Rather, it seeks to extend the set of environmental issues that affect choices made by existing planners to include those that, while important and potentially decisive, are beyond the state-of-the-art because it is too costly to acquire and maintain the relevant information We are particularly interested in minimally intrusive methods that can take guidance from a user who is familiar with the situation on the ground, and that use that information in appropriate future contexts. Successful efforts will enable automatic path-planning systems to remember what has happened recently and to create improved plans by relying on direct experience and the experiences of other units. Progress along these lines can be tracked in several dimensions: the number and scope of environmental considerations that can be added to the system; the ease-of-use (or lack of intrusion) for the user providing the environmental data; and the ability of the system to produce improved routes using this information.",451,3162,1,No,No,No,,"Proof-of-principle demonstration that identifies the nature, source, and significance of the new information provided, and the benefits to be realized from this extension.

Operation at high photocurrents improves the dynamic range and noise figure of the underlying analog photonic links. As a result, significant efforts have been devoted in the past to increase the power handling of photodiodes, denoted by their 1-dB compression point. However, the amplitude linearity of a photodiode, defined by its third-order output intercept point (OIP3), may significantly degrade as its 1-dB compression point is reached. Thus, it is desirable to simultaneously achieve highly linear and high power photodiode operation. Further, it is necessary to minimize the phase non-linearity of the photodiode, expressed as power-to-phase conversion factor (PPC), in order to minimize the excess phase noise and timing jitter in microwave photonic systems. The objective of this research is to develop innovative photodetection modules that constitute significant advances in power handling, amplitude linearity, and phase linearity over the state-of-the-art for 2 – 20 GHz bandwidth applications. This topic envisions that these enhancements will leverage radio frequency (RF) power combining the output from an array of high-power photodiodes. For example, ignoring the excess insertion loss in the RF power combiner, a four-element array of photodiodes should effectively lead to a two-fold increase in 1-dB compression photocurrent and a 6-dB improvement in OIP3 over a single photodiode. However, practical concerns, such as excess insertion loss and broadband impedance matching, will lead to a limited (optimal) array size. As a result, enhancement in the performance of a single photodiode is also likely to be needed. Monolithic integration of photodiode arrays with RF power combiners may be required for enhanced performance, manufacturability, and reduced module form factor. Concurrent design of photodiodes and combiners may further enhance module performance.",307,2168,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a study to identify and quantify main sources of photodiode nonlinearity.

Establish communication and processing architectures to enable a navigation system to work flexibly, with a variety of sensors and sensor combinations, and to simplify the robust addition or subtraction of sensors. Develop alternate navigation algorithms, as appropriate, to improve performance with various aiding sensors.","There is a growing need for low cost, robust, and seamless navigation solutions for military users, on a variety of platforms and in a variety of GPS denied areas, such as urban canyons, dense forests, inside buildings and underground. One of the primary barriers to flexibility in navigation systems is the high integration cost, both initially and whenever changes or upgrades are required. As lower cost inertial systems become available, enabled in part by MEMS developments, the ability to create inexpensive and flexible multi-sensor navigation systems depends on lowering the complexity of integrating additional aiding sensors. The intent of this effort is to provide an abstraction layer to enable a navigation algorithm or filter to work with a variety of sensors and sensor combinations, and to simplify the robust addition of sensors to (or subtraction from) a navigation system. Potential aiding sensors include, but are not limited to: LADARs, laser rangers, Doppler sensors, video sensors, cameras (including camera phones), magnetic sensors, semantic information, and various RF signals. Most aiding sensors provide measures, either directly or after processing, of range and/or its time derivatives, measures of angle and/or its time derivatives, or relative measures of these quantities. A specific challenge to the development of an abstraction layer lies in the range of data that comes from such sensors. The data rate can range from 10,000 Hz, depending on the sensor and the application. Additional challenges lie in the noise levels of the disparate data and the integration of the measurements into the model to show the dependence between the measurement and the states. Additionally, the system will need to provide a navigation performance of 3 m 3D rms for many indoor navigation applications, or less than 6 m 3D rms for GPS- like navigation applications. The focus of this SBIR is on the need for a simplified interface to ease the integration of additional aiding sensors. This effort should include a combination of the following: the development of different or parallel navigation filters, the abstraction of sensor-specific processing algorithms, the development of processing approaches/architectures to segregate what processing is done where (e.g., in the navigator, in the sensor itself, or in both). Interaction with geospatial or other databases is encouraged.

Follow on efforts must model and simulate, manufacture and test the proposed technologies.","In the past few decades, EP has been applied to progressively more spacecraft and more missions. The electrical energy used in the engine of spacecraft is most often derived from solar panels; however, spacecraft that use solar powered EP have a low thrust to weight ratio, limiting the acceleration rates and increasing the time required for orbit transfers. Even small changes in thrust to weight and thrust to power can significantly increase the speed of orbit transfers. The goal of this solicitation is to develop a means of increasing the thrust to power ratio and reducing the weight of EP systems while maintaining a high specific impulse. Revolutionary concepts are encouraged; however, as a minimum the proposed thrusters must provide higher thrust to power across the spectrum of specific impulse operating points while prolonging the operational lifetime of the thruster. Specific objectives are a thruster specific mass of less than 3 Kg/kW while either demonstrating a thrust to power ratio of over 100:1 at a specific impulse of over 1,000 sec, or over 40:1 at 4,000 sec. For all approaches, the ability to throttle the thruster is highly desirable with performance interpolated between these extremes. The minimum lifetime of the proposed electric thruster shall be at least 20,000 hours with a goal of exceeding 50,000 hours at nominal operating conditions.

Develop a process to passivate the internal surface of copper MCC’s to prevent chemical and electro-chemical corrosion of the copper when the MCC is operated with filtered water as the coolant.,"Modern, high-power laser-diodes (LD) generate thermal-power densities approaching average values of 103W/cm2. The most common method to remove the waste heat is a copper micro-channel heat-exchanger with water as the working fluid[1]. Copper has a high value of thermal conductivity and a high value of electrical conductivity whereas ""The best liquid coolant is deionized water because of its thermophysical properties.”[2]. However, copper chemically corrodes when exposed to water and the passage of electrical current through the water during LD operation results in electro-chemical corrosion[1,3]. The copper surface is typically plated with a film of nickel to prevent the corrosion of the copper and the nickel is subsequently plated with a film of gold to prevent oxidation of the nickel[4]. Ni/Au-plated copper micro-channel cooler have been found to corrode under operation for two reasons. 1. The heat-exchangers are formed from multiple layers of photo-etched copper which are diffusion bonded to produce the high-surface area micro-channels required to transfer the heat efficiently from the LD into the water and, 2. The micro-channel heat-exchanger is plated after the formation of the channels. The uneven, non-planar surfaces lead to non-uniform electric fields that interfere with the metal plating process. There are pin-holes in the Ni/Au films that allow local corrosion of the copper. There is also local mechanical erosion of the Ni/Au films by the high velocity stream of water during operation of the heat-exchanger that also allows local corrosion of the copper. This erosion may be enhanced by small particulates in the water. What is desired is a conformal, pin-hole free, thin-film(s) to passivate non-planar surfaces of copper against chemical and electro-chemical corrosion as well as mechanical erosion by high –velocity streams of water in the presence of an electrical current.",288,1912,1,No,No,No,,"Develop and demonstrate a passivation process that will result in a pin-hole free protective coating that will enhance the useful lifetime of MCCs to survive when > 5X108 coulombs/cm2 of charge is injected into the LD.

Of growing interest is the non-medical use of one- and two-photon confocal laser scanning microscopy [3,4] to diagnose the excitation and relaxation dynamics of various sub-micron structures such as semiconductor quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles used for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Because structural variations tremendously affect the optical characteristics, the ability to resolve luminescence or scattered light at the sub-micron level is of critical importance to ascertain how the performance varies from structure to structure. Broadband optics are required to collect emitted or scattered light throughout the visible and ultraviolet (200-800 nm) regions, with particular emphasis on the ultraviolet region because of the relative dearth of low-dispersion focusing and beamsplitting optics here. Minimal spectral and temporal dispersion is required so that ultrafast (< 1 ps) dynamics can be measured without external compensating optics.

Direct military end-user feedback will be used to guide further development from an initial instantiation of the application.,"Many military handhelds are today characterized by tight integration of the hardware with a single application. This results in stove-piped systems that provide limited functionality and are difficult to update or enhance. The goal of this topic is to develop, evaluate, and improve militarily relevant applications (apps) for handheld devices. Innovations are sought in apps for the tactical battlefield as well as for other military missions and tasks. The apps proposed will maximize the use of state-of-the-art commercial technology and provide new innovative functionality for various military domains. Examples may include (but are not limited to) apps for language translation, training, command and control, blue-force tracking, reporting, mission-planning, ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance), real-time collaboration, geo-spatial visualization, analysis, and logistics. The apps should target the Android platform for initial design and implementation. Particular attention must be paid to security, ease-of-use, as well as to any server infrastructure required. Some of the apps will function largely without network access (except for occasional synchronization or updates), while other apps will require more consistent network connectivity. However, strong emphasis is placed on the capability to run with minimal bandwidth consumption and on application robustness in spite of frequent network disconnection. A proposed effort may also focus on demonstrating middleware or utilities that would enable and/or be shared across multiple handheld apps. The experience garnered from the development of TIGR (Tactical Ground Reporting System) [1,2] has demonstrated that the key to rapid and effective application development is incorporation of direct feedback from users. The intent is to have a pool of military users that will ""beta-test” the apps developed under this effort and provide feedback that guide subsequent improvement and enhanced functionality. An ‘apps store’ like repository will be created that will allow test users to download apps on demand. Appropriate feedback and detailed usage collection mechanism will be put in place. The software developed as part of this effort is intended to be widely distributed to warfighter communities. The Government will require delivery of source code for code review and for the purpose of certification to operate on tactical platforms. If the proposed plan is to incorporate any company-owned IP, the proposals should include costing for widespread use (e.g. DOD-wide enterprise or per-seat licensing). This costing should also include a firm cost offer for a two-year license that the government may or may not choose to exercise at its discretion.

The design tools developed with this SBIR will enable the simplification of the complex IC design process as well as help lower the design and fabrication costs for the low volume, high performance ASICs that the DoD desires. This simplification in design should not sacrifice performance metrics such as speed, power and efficiencies of the ICs.

This makes sense from the standpoint of minimizing development costs for each stand-alone system, but it forces significant exploitation software re-work to handle sensor and mission variants. Also, this approach to ISR system development makes interoperability difficult and limits the potential for multi-sensor integration, the result being that we currently have a limited capability for multi-INT exploitation and few tools for automatically combining data from and cross-cueing between multiple sources. Finally, our ISR systems typically are set up to process data in a linear way: the sensor produces data, automated exploitation algorithms operate on the data to produce an output, and human-machine interfaces are used to enable humans to understand the outputs, produce products, make decisions, and issue follow-on tasking. But there is generally no effort to more fully integrate the machine and human processing together to take advantages of the strengths of each, particularly the ability of humans to use context to resolve alternative hypotheses or improve estimates, the ability of machines to prioritize opportunities for humans to provide that feedback, and the ability of machines to use that feedback to modify previous, current, and future processed results. Emerging techniques and improving capabilities for real-time control and high-volume data transport between sensor platforms and ground systems make it possible now to more fully integrate humans and machines in the tasking, processing, and control of all ISR assets and achieve multi-sensor exploitation. The ultimate goal for future multi-sensor/multi-platform ISR is full automation and control of sensors, sensor processing, and exploitation optimized to satisfy prioritized ISR requirements across an entire theater.

These processes not only add considerable fabrication cost, but also induce rough etching surfaces to the polymer photonic devices, thus causing a significant amount of scattering loss. Recently, we have witnessed escalating progress of various lithography-free fabrication methods for nanoscale structures with high precision on a wide variety of materials, such as microcontact printing (or soft lithography) [1], nano-imprint lithography (NIL) [2], scanning-probe-based techniques (e.g., atomic force microscope lithography) [3], and dip-pen lithography [4]. These technologies have proven to be successful in replicating feature sizes around hundreds of nanometers, but they will face great challenges for micrometer scale because of ""Proximity Effect”[5]. For example, nanoimprint lithography creates the desired features by displacing polymer materials. This could lead to systematic effects over long distances. A large, dense array with protrusions will displace significantly more polymer than an isolated protrusion. Additionally, there are several other serious drawbacks upon these fabrication methods such as overlay, defects and template wearing. During the last decades, people have tried molding methods for the fabrication of both active [6] and passive polymer photonic devices within the tri-services including the DARPA MORPH program [7-10]. Of these methods, soft molds using PDMS and hard molds based on silicon has been used to create polymer devices with typical feature size of several micro-meters. Yet the concerns of mold durability, and the capability of transferring patterns into both rigid and flexible substrates are still not completely released. Thus it is highly desirable to develop a low cost, flexible, lithography free fabrication technology for high throughput reproduction of polymer photonic devices that can further advance the manufacturing of polymer integrated photonics with feature size from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers.",296,2133,1,No,No,No,,"Design a lithography free fabrication method with at least one device implementation with a demonstration of a polymer photonic device.

Demonstrate scalability and repeatability of the innovative fabrication tool for polymer photonic devices. Industrial production of commercial polymer photonic devices with the fabrication tools should be conducted. The target device is a 40 GHz differential phase shift keying modulator which is used in coherent telecommunications (commercial application). The commercial transition plan is the most likely because it combines the high optical power of a photonic polymer system with the advantage of lower cost and higher volume that lithography-less manufacturing can provide. Transition plan includes successful license acquisition by transceiver manufacturer then transfer to telecommunications equipment manufacturer then deployment to telecommunications service providers.",1,"X.Y.

Industrial applications include metal cutting, welding, and marking. Scientific applications include inducing laser-guide stars for astronomy, gravitational wave detection, laser cooling and trapping, and laser-based particle accelerators. Defense applications include laser-based weapons, laser-induced spark, and lidar. The small size and high optical-to-optical efficiency of fiber lasers and amplifiers also makes them promising components for scalable high-power laser systems employing spectral or coherent beam combination [1], but the output power and energy from individual fiber lasers and amplifiers have yet to reach their full potential. The main limitations for scaling fiber lasers and amplifiers to higher power and higher energy are 1) nonlinear optical effects within both the active gain fibers and the passive delivery fibers, 2) spatial and spectral brightness of the optical pump source, and 3) physical limitations such as thermal failure at splices or defects [2, 3]. However, the limitations due to nonlinear effects and pump brightness place conflicting constraints on fiber design. For efficient beam combining, fiber lasers and amplifiers must have a narrow spectral bandwidth, but these narrow-band systems are the most susceptible to stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), which is a nonlinear process that can scatter significant power backwards into the sensitive front end of the laser system. Several techniques have been used to suppress SBS, but the most common is to utilize short fibers with large cores to reduce the interaction length and lower the Brillouin gain. Conversely, double-clad fibers require significant length to transfer the pump light from the cladding to the doped core. The cladding-core coupling can be increased (to enable shorter gain fibers) by decreasing the cladding diameter, but smaller cladding size necessitates pump lasers with higher spatial brightness. In addition, for higher efficiency the pump lasers’ spectra must be narrowed and stabilized to match the gain fiber’s absorption peak; the peak for Yb-doped silica is at 976 nm and has a width of ~7 nm. Currently, all state-of-the-art fiber lasers and amplifiers are limited by pump brightness [4]. State-of-the-art diode laser pumps are limited to about 100 W from 100 µm/0.22 NA (numerical aperture) delivery fibers and about 300 W from 200 µm/0.22 NA delivery fibers [5]. DARPA seeks innovative approaches to realizing a wavelength-stabilized, narrow output spectrum, multi-kW fiber-coupled diode laser system with brightness that is at least ten times higher than the current state of the art for pumping high-power fiber laser amplifiers.

Many soldiers do not wear their issued earplugs for fear of loss of situational awareness. Additionally, one set of traditional earplugs cannot protect against various acoustic threats which range from lower intensity tank noise to the higher intensity noise from gunshots and roadside bomb explosions. State of the art technology offers active ear protection solutions which contain digital processors that block out damaging sound waves and still allow users to hear everyday noises. These solutions however, are not adaptable and are prohibitively expensive for wide-spread deployment. The goal of this solicitation is to develop a low cost, passive ear protection device to be worn as an earplug or headset that will allow the Soldier to maintain situational awareness but filter out harmful noise threats. Newly developed acoustic meta-materials may be leveraged to address this problem. Meta-materials are composite systems whose bulk properties are derived from the geometric structure rather than the chemical constituents of the material. Recently, significant progress has been made in acoustic metamaterial crystal design to create band gaps which can be used for sound attenuation. DARPA seeks to further the research to utilize system nonlinearities to provide passively tunable systems that can be manufactured using scalable materials including polymers and metals. Acoustic meta-material responses will be explored which can (1) selectively attenuate the noise amplitude at various frequencies and/or (2) filter harmful noise levels while allowing everyday conversation. In addition to nonlinear acoustic meta-materials, other passive solutions will be considered.",260,1788,1,No,No,No,,Investigate the technical approaches for either (1) A frequency selective acoustic filter for hearing protection with > 12 dB attenuation at frequencies > 3 kHz and 115 dBA) with > 25 dB attenuation and lower intensities (<65 dBA) with < 1 dB attenuation.

Impact will include soldier hearing protection systems and occupational safety devices for civilian applications ranging from airline and highway technicians to policemen. Applications include not only ear protection devices, but the materials can also be adapted to sound barriers for both industrial and residential areas.

Tools and techniques are sought that produce, analyze, document, and validate radio waveform software required to implement communications networks. This effort enables standardized, interoperable waveforms and protocols across multiple processor families.","Existing defense wireless communication networks consist of many radios utilizing many different physical layer waveforms and protocols to build robust special purpose networks. The time required to develop and validate the robust operation of wireless communication waveforms and protocols greatly exceeds the development time for the radio hardware – often taking 4 to 5 years for the radio software to meet requirements for robustness and functionality. The proliferation of waveform designs for specific purposes running on specific radio hardware platforms leads to severe cost issues in development of the waveforms and protocols, and also results in costly logistic maintenance of the waveform software over the lifetime of the radio hardware. DARPA seeks to create a completely new systems level approach to software development for use in radio products. The program develops, demonstrates and validates tools to address these problems by enabling the communication engineer to define the communication properties of the waveform, protocol, network, and radio hardware and then simulate the expected performance of his defined waveform(s). The innovative tools translate the waveform specifications directly into hardware design, software design, firmware design, specification documents, regression tests, performance validation tests, and automated software production. This enables the communication engineer to directly synthesize and validate the software for the product, rather than requiring a long hand coded software development cycle. DARPA also seeks to create appropriate software functionality for real time management of highly adaptive radio networks. This effort supports development of an innovative Radio Environment (RE) database that would automatically provide a radio network real time information about the local spectrum environment, including emitter locations, waveforms in use, frequencies in use, signal strengths, interference conditions, available spectrum, spectrum brokers, access protocols, local spectrum utilization policies and network services. This database would be assembled through aggregation of spectrum activity reports from adaptive radio nodes within the service area, as well as through apriori information from local regulatory authorities. The results of this effort are expected to produce tool families that dramatically simplify the end to end development process of next generation radios, and the software that runs on these radios. It clearly documents the final software, resulting in bit for bit unambiguous specifications, and far more efficient development and validation processes. The resulting improvement in cycle time will then enable much more rapid development of new products and new applications for defense and commercial communications products.",394,2825,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the approaches for languages, architectural components, and proof of concept that shows the expected development process that will be used by the communications engineer when using these tools.

This includes offering standardizing documents to organizations such as Institute of Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Wireless Innovation Forum, and International Telecommunication Union (ITU) that can establish standards for the defense communications industry, and subsequently for the commercial communications industry. The feasibility should show that the resulting system will be practical, efficient, and integrate with traditional tools such as compilers, standard operating systems (OS), board support packages, and typical field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) development tools of multiple vendors. Examples of the functions of tools that this effort should address for communications software include: • protocol & network requirements analysis, specification, development, simulation & performance validation, requirements traceability • automated software / firmware design of standard radio waveforms and protocols • partitioning of software / firmware amongst multiple processors • porting software across multiple processor types and/or FPGA types • dynamic range analysis, optimizing fixed point implementations • produce accurate, complete & final design documentation of waveforms, protocols, partitioning of functions to processors • regression test and validate performance requirements of waveform and protocol, provide bit exact test databases at various points in the signal chain • validate implementation losses match theory • validate encoding /decoding bit fields, error correcting codes, interleavers • validate real time performance, memory leakage, interrupt service drivers, deadlock conditions • validate messages passed between multiple processor architectures • real time applications and services offered through the wireless network(s) Phase I deliverables will include a quarterly technical and financial report of the status of the effort and progress toward accomplishment of research requirements. Phase I requires a final report that describes technical accomplishments, as well as technical and program plan for Phase II activities. The Phase II description will include technical metrics and a risk assessment appropriate for the Phase II proposed effort.","Develop a prototype of the essential architectural components sufficiently to add clear visibility that the resulting system can transition into a viable development tool suite. Demonstrate, and validate a significant number of the architectural components sufficiently to add clear visibility that resulting network services and applications available through the wireless networks can transition to provide valued services to radio nodes and networks within its operable region. This can include the ability to assist in spectrum negotiation transactions, and delivery of local spectrum regulatory compliance policies and rules, and the ability to define compliant waveforms and protocols to local subscribers. It may also provide access information regarding available network services. Testing with a military systems integrator is highly desirable and would provide a large incentive for further development after the end of Phase II. This phase has a target Transition Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 while demonstrating the potential of progressing to TRL 6 during Phase III. It is expected that the prototype deliverables of this phase will be utilized in a DARPA communication program effort as well as transition to a military Programs of Record. In addition, there are multiple commercial applications that will be able to utilize the results of this effort for commercial and government entities. Phase II deliverables will include quarterly technical and financial reports of the status of the effort and progress toward accomplishment of research requirements. Phase II will also require a final report that includes technical accomplishments, metrics of performance as well as technical and program plan for Phase III activities. The Phase III description will include technical metrics and a risk assessment appropriate for the Phase III proposed effort.","Advance the tool suite to a full scale implementation of requisite functions to achieve the stated objectives and bring the tool to the level of an Alpha test, then a Beta test product demonstration of its capabilities, and finally transition to a maintained software product business. In addition, advance the Radio Environment database or other network services to a full scale implementation of all requisite functions to achieve the stated objectives and bring the database system to the level of an Alpha test, and then a Beta test product demonstration of its capabilities. The resulting product or suite of products should achieve many of the objectives listed in previous phases. This resulting product portfolio is expected to result in a capability that can have profound effect on radio communications product development and deployment by dramatically reducing product development and deployment cycle times for defense and commercial radio product developers. In the defense community there are many companies that develop communication radios, including DARPA and the JTRS JPEO. In the commercial field, there are fewer producers but the product volume is much higher, approaching $1T/yr. The ability to accelerate the software product development process for these industries has enormous defense and commercial value.

Over the last several years, a new class of small swarming tactical boat has emerged that cannot be adequately engaged using these traditional tactical signatures due to its small size, speed, and maneuverability. DARPA is seeking a small munition (should fit inside an ""A Size” sonobuoy footprint -36 inches long and 4.5 inches in diameter) that is capable of operating on or near the ocean surface and is capable of targeting small tactical craft on the basis of their acoustic signatures. In order to be tactically effective, this munition should be able to operate at very high speeds (>100 knots) in sea states 4 as well as operate at higher speeds in calm water. Such a munition will provide the U.S. Navy with the ability to effectively engage this new class of swarming boat and thus protect naval vessels from swarm attacks. This munition will have the ability to pursue targets that are initially a maximum of 4 nautical miles from the munition launch point and transit to the target vicinity using a combination of internal navigation and external reference such as GPS and vectors provided by other systems. The munition must have the ability to acoustically sense the presence of a group of high speed small boat(s) and then acoustically single out and engage an individual boat from the group. The proposed solution should represent integrated combinations of advance hull forms, high energy propulsion, and hydrodynamic controls that are capable of achieving a combination of very high speed and good sea keeping characteristics on the surface of the water. The munition may leave the surface of the water for short periods and/or skip over waves or penetrate through waves during transit to the target. In addition, the payload carrying capability (transport factor) of the munition should be considered as important design criteria. For the purposes of this topic, a ""surface munition” is defined as one that displaces water at rest, operates with near continuous contact with the surface of the water, and for which the interface of the vehicle with the sea surface is a major design driver. The munition may leave (above or below) the surface of the water during its transit to the target; however, the final engagement must be on the surface. Although provisions for the weight and volume of an explosive warhead must be considered in the design, this Topic does not include the development of the warhead.",428,2584,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the conceptual hull form, propulsion and control design of the proposed solution.

For the open sea test, the speeds and ranges will be less than those required for the Phase III development effort. This phase will end with a TRL 5 prototype demonstration at scaled speed in representative sea-states.",A successful Phase II demonstration could lead to the inclusion of the munition in existing and developmental programs such as the USN’s current Shipboard Protection System (SPS) or DARPA’s Very High Speed Vessel (VHSV) program. A Phase III effort could include the fabrication of several full-scale prototype munitions capable of full speed (100kt +) operations in sea state 4 and the capability to transit the full 4 nautical mile tactical range and pursue highly maneuvering small boats.

State of the art methods still cannot attain clinical grade sensitivity and specificity while having portability, long-term storage capability (e.g., for protein based immunoassays) and minimum sample preparation. In addition, challenges still exist for sample collection without trained medical personnel that minimize loss of analytes. Proposals may address all or one of the following aspects described below: 1) sample collection, 2) highly specific and stable recognition molecules, 3) reagent storage. All proposed methods should enable low/no power operation, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-waved analysis, and good manufacturing practice (GMP) procedures. 1) Typically, blood is the biological sample of choice for diagnostics. Minimally invasive collection often relies on a finger prick and capillary collection. Since a small volume is collected, any loss of analyte in transfer from collector to transducer decreases probability of detection. Therefore, innovative methods for minimally-invasive, simple to operate, high efficiency sample collection are needed, such as highly non-fouling surfaces or efficient concentration methods. Proposals should address the patient interface, sample collection, and sample delivery to the analysis device. Collection methods that increase the sample volumes that may be collected in a CLIA-waved device are encouraged. 2) Development of long-term, stable, reagents is also critical for deployment of analysis devices for point-of-care diagnostics. We seek proposals that exploit recent innovations in high-performance stable molecular recognition elements (e.g., aptamers, pseudo-knots, hairpins, DNA-enzymes) together with labeling scheme internal to the recognition element while exhibiting high stability and signal strength. These molecular structures can be stored for long periods and undergo highly specific conformational changes upon binding of the target analyte, reducing the confounding variable of non-specific adsorption to the transducer, ubiquitous in complex biological matrices. Any transduction scheme is acceptable (e.g., optical, electrical, mechanical magnetic). The requirement of any proposed approach is that the signal change be specifically associated with the conformation change (increasing specificity) and that it can be used with a low power system and with negligible degradation over time (e.g., for optical approaches a pair of gold nanoparticles whose spectral properties change upon binding can have 6 orders of magnitude greater signal strength at the same optical power and detection efficiency vs. organic fluorophores and even larger differential stability). 3) For reagent storage, fluids of interest are those required for commonly used sample preparation methods (lysis, protein purification, nucleic acid purification) and sensing/assay methods (e.g., immunoassays, nucleic acid amplification and/or detection, small molecule detection). Dried reagent storage may be included. Proposals should address methods for dispensing or release of the stored reagents for use in the analysis device. Bioanalysis frequently requires dispensing of reagents at different times and or locations on a device. Therefore, proposals should describe the ability of dispensing methods to address such needs. Storage formats/devices should be compatible with miniaturized analysis devices. Total storage volume will be dependent on analysis to be run. Proposers are encouraged to describe the potential volume-based design variations.",496,3660,1,No,No,No,,"1) Develop approaches for blood sample collection methods and quantitative recovery of the critical analytes from the sample collector using standard laboratory assays. The proposer should choose a clinically relevant analyte of interest that is currently challenging to recover due to its low concentration in blood (e.g., aM-pM), and demonstrate an increased recovery of this analyte in an appropriate volume as compared to standard collection methods, such as the capillary (using the same collection volume, or a CLIA-waiver compatible larger volume). 2) Demonstrate highly-specific detection of the target analyte with the recognition element in the presence of other ""background"" molecules that non-specifically adsorb to the surface of the transducer. Quantification of clinically relevant concentration of an analyte in the presence of serum must be demonstrated. The selected target molecules of choice (protein, nucleic acids), should be DoD relevant and not limited to trivial examples such as biotin-streptavidin or BSA. Molecules of interest would include cortisol, toxins, nucleic acids and various proteins. 3) Develop innovative approaches for reagent storage and/or dispersing methods. They should be DoD relevant (see 2 above) and demonstrate progress to suggest feasibility of storage for> 1 month at a variety of temperatures (~20-37 degree C).","1) Validate feasibility of the method developed in Phase I with a practical protocol that can be used by untrained personnel within a relevant time frame for sample collection and delivery needs for point of care diagnostics (~ 10-20 minutes). Provide a detailed plan for integrating the proposed methods for processing and sample analysis post collection, with other requisite technologies for a point of care diagnostic device. Demonstrate quantification of 2 or more analytes in whole blood previously not quantifiable with existing CLIA-waived collection methods. 2) Demonstrate quantification of 2 or more biomarkers in whole blood over 6 orders of magnitude in concentration with clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. 3) Design, develop and demonstrate a complete reagent storage unit/device for reagent release/dispensing using standard assays or analyses on the reagents that have been stored at multiple temperatures for at least 1 month in the designed storage packaging/device. Demonstration of integration/compatibility with micro analysis devices is encouraged. Six (6) months storage should be initiated within the two-year performance period and testing plans developed. The stored reagents should be able to quantify at least 2 biomarkers in whole blood with standard analytical techniques and should be compared with fresh reagents to demonstrate equivalent clinical performance (limit of detection, sensitivity, specificity).","The technology to be developed is applicable to deployable medical diagnostics.

We are now entering a post-antibiotic era where alternative strategies need to be investigated to discover inhibitors of bacterial virulence rather than bacterial growth. This strategy will exert mild evolutionary pressure on bacteria and subsequently lower probability of resistance. The discovery of new virulence factors of bacteria is key to the understanding of pathogenesis and to the identification of new targets for therapeutics, vaccines and drugs. This is true for known pathogens as well as emerging and genetically modified organisms. With the emergence of the genomic era, the field of bacterial pathogenesis has advanced rapidly over the last two decades. Microbial genomic investigations have identified traditional virulence factors for many pathogens. However, genomic investigations can only identify factors of known virulence importance and are dependent on whole genome analysis. For many organisms, the exact mechanisms of pathogenesis still remain a mystery. Thus new methods and platforms for the rapid identification of virulence factors using post-genomic technologies are needed. Virulence factors comprise a broad range of bacterial components from proteins and peptides to polysaccharides. Many of these function in bacterial adherence, colonization, interaction with host immune factors and invasion of the host mucosal surface - among others. They may be attached to the surface of the pathogen or released into the extracellular environment. Current studies in the identification of virulence mechanisms can be slow and tedious. The development of rapid, preferably high throughput methods for the identification of potential virulence factors would significantly speed the pace of discovery and the development of new treatment options. An innovative solution that will rapidly identify mechanisms of virulence for pathogenic bacteria is requested. The ideal system would be one that isolates and identifies virulence factors without bias with consideration that such factors often directly interact with the host or host environment. The solution will identify lead candidate factors across a wide range of functions (i.e., bacterial adherence, host immune interaction, resistance to host effects, etc). It will utilize state-of-the-art methods in a rapid and cost effective manner and will result in a detailed characterization of each candidate virulence factor that can be used for follow-on validation and development.

For the purpose of this topic, we define insider threat as malevolent (or possibly inadvertent) actions by an already trusted person in a secure environment with access to sensitive information and information systems and sources.","Information systems security and counter-intelligence personnel are drowning in ever expanding oceans of observational data from heterogeneous sources and sensors from which they must extract indicators of increasingly sophisticated malicious insider behavior. They are currently only able to use this data reactively – they can use the data to help investigate and resolve suspicions they develop by more traditional means. A major goal of this topic is to enable investigators to use the data proactively as a basis for developing suspicions and to observe precursors to malicious behavior and potentially stop it before it occurs. The fundamental challenge is one of finding a poorly understood, subtle, or hidden signal (indicators of malicious behavior) buried in enormous amounts of noise (observational data of no immediate relevance) under the constraint that the measures of significance are themselves moving targets (based on dynamic context) that must be continually monitored and updated. A significant part of that challenge is detecting deceptive behavior that is characteristic of malicious intent. The first step in meeting this challenge is to create a scalable, distributed infrastructure to securely collect, store, access, process, and correlate relevant data from heterogeneous sources over extended periods of time. The next step is to determine whether an individual or group of individuals is exhibiting anomalous behavior that is also malicious. However, this analysis is very heavily dependent on the context of the individual, groups of individuals and any data involved. Furthermore, context (e.g., location, time, roles and relations) is dynamic and so must be continually inferred, managed and applied automatically. In both the real and virtual world, it is very difficult to do anything without leaving some evidence behind. Attempts to conceal or remove evidence generally create new evidence that, if detected, could be a strong indication of the perpetrator’s intent. Looking for such evidence could potentially be easier than recognizing explicit attacks. Forensic-like techniques can be used to find clues, gather and evaluate evidence and combine them deductively. Security is often difficult because the defenses must be perfect, while the attacker needs to find only one flaw. An emphasis on forensics could reverse the burden by requiring the attacker and his tools to be perfect, while the defender needs only a few clues to recognize an intrusion is underway. Techniques of interest to this topic include, but are not limited to, techniques to (a) derive information about the relationship between deductions, the likely intent of inferred actions, and suggestions about what evidence might mean and (b) dynamically forecast context-dependent behaviors – both malicious and non-malicious. Also of interest are on-line and off-line algorithms for feature extraction and detection in enormous graphs (as in billions of nodes) as well as hybrid engines where deduction and feature detection mutually inform one another and novel host based sensors. Sensors developed for this topic might have, but are not limited to, the following characteristics: • Unobtrusive and host-based in order to capture the comprehensive range of human interaction with computer endpoints, to include all keystroke activity, communication vectors, application usage, processes and use of removable media. • Provide unambiguous and irrefutable attribution of all computer end-user activity and context to discern malicious and benign intent as well as detect concealment techniques. • Enable researchers to apply tailored, policy-based rule sets against the computer endpoints and seamlessly reconfigure them to ensure the quality and integrity of data collected and to dynamically test and evaluate new hypotheses. These granular controls are critical in helping an organization employ a risk management model to prioritize audit of the highest risk behaviors, individuals and assets in the enterprise and eliminate false positives to ensure the analyst is not overwhelmed by a ""data dump” of information.

We are seeking to increase range, velocities and intercept rates that conventional powder guns cannot achieve. Acceleration of projectiles to velocities greater than 2 km/s is required to extend the capability of modern kinetic weapons to intercept high-velocity offensive weapons as well as provide long range fire support. Conventional, chemically driven cannons reach a (practical) fundamental limit at ~ 1 km/s to 1.5 km/s due to the adiabatic flame temperature (sound speed) of conventional explosives. Higher projectile velocities cannot be achieved without the use of auxiliary heating. Currently the Navy is pursuing an electro-magnetic gun concept. This SBIR is intended to investigate alternatives to EM launch more suitable to transportable fire basing systems. In addition to providing increased range, safety and intercept these high velocity projectiles will be insensitive material (IM) compliant by using kinetic energy rather than high explosives. This will reduce the significant logistics requirements for resupply, storage and handling of hazardous materials when dealing with conventional powder guns.

Narratives related to experiences do not necessarily have to be veridical representations of history. A good example of channeling emotion and memories related to combat experiences into storytelling is Joe Haldeman’s, ""Forever War” published in 1974 and winning both the Hugo and Nebula Awards in which Haldeman translates experiences and feelings related to the Vietnam War into a Science Fiction theme. Graphic novels/sequential art have rich traditions of high-quality artwork and rich storytelling related to combat experiences as exemplified in the 1951 series, ""Frontline Combat” and the 1966 series, ""Blazing Combat”. Considered political in their day for their stark portrayals of war, both are now considered hallmarks of the genre both stylistically and in the emotionality of their content. Likewise the recent work of Garry Trudeau has chronicled the road to recovery following combat injuries with both humor and sensitivity. The current effort is aimed at providing authoring toolkits to allow Service members and Veterans to relate their own stories via a graphic novel/sequential art format of equally high quality. The goal is to create web-based software with a simple interface that assists in both storytelling and graphical content creation that can relate experiences either directly or metaphorically. While providing simple-to-use authoring tools, the results should have the look and feel of a professional product and provide the flexibility of telling a wide range of stories. For example, content creation could relate to modern combat, historical combat, science fiction, or fantasy. But, the authoring tools MUST allow the user to draw from a library of artwork, icons, and other templates to assist them in telling a story related to combat experiences. The software tools must assist the user at every opportunity to tell a story and the end result should be a professional looking narrative comparable to the best graphic novels/sequential art. The tool should also include pre-prepared examples of full-stories that can be used for inspiration and guidance. Innovation is key to this program and software must be designed to inspire, encourage, and guide users in the development of their own storylines and to guide them to additional resources if they are interested in exploring and/or obtaining personalized support and services. Proposals MUST reflect team expertise in developing professional narrative, especially web comics and/or graphic novels/sequential art. Preference will be given to teams who demonstrate expertise in content development, military expertise, and psychological health. One of the goals of this program is to determine the best way to use these narratives tools. Can they be a stand-alone resource? Can they be used as an aid to formal therapy? Is this approach safe and effective? Therefore, teams must be well-rounded. Innovation in the program is seen in the areas of user-interface design, flexibility of tool to tell a wide-range of stories, and the quality of the artwork and storytelling produced by the tool.

For the purpose of this topic, fidelity means degree of similarity between synthetic and real data. In particular, applications developed with high fidelity synthetic data must work on corresponding real data.","In recent years, interest in social networks has dramatically increased. Massive amounts of social network data are being collected for military, government and commercial purposes. Much of this data is most naturally represented as rich graph structures, with many types of links connecting sets of entities in the graph where links and entities can have multiple attributes. The availability of a wide range of social network data to the research community is essential for progress in the analysis of such data. Experience to date has shown that the development and evaluation of social applications can produce very different results depending on the social graphs used. However, in contrast to the need, there are only a small number of measurement-generated graphs available whose continued distribution and experimental use faces two significant challenges. First, owners of datasets are increasingly concerned about inadvertently revealing private information with their anonymized datasets. Recent work shows that malicious parties can recover information from anonymized graphs using various de-anonymization attacks. Given recent privacy compromises, these concerns act as a strong disincentive against sharing graph datasets. Second, the limited number of available graphs is insufficient to generate meaningful experimental results. Ideally, researchers would like to experiment with multiple real graphs with a wide variety of characteristics to produce statistically confident results. While the use of synthetic data has its own challenges, it offers great opportunities. A user can flexibly control and rapidly and economically generate data sets with desired characteristics, size and quality (e.g., as measured by error characteristics). Such data can be published, and thus allows other researchers to repeat experiments and compare algorithms. Synthetic data can’t replace real data, but it can significantly lower the barriers to entry into research requiring such data and provide the type of experimental control necessary to help establish a solid scientific foundation for such research. DARPA is interested in ""first principles” methods for generating high fidelity synthetic social networks that are based on integrating various real world data sets and using appropriate social and behavioral theories to infer the relational networks. These networks are labeled, dynamic and exhibit variability that reflects particular features of the entities and their relations being modeled. The key problem that proposals must address is that of creating a statistical/probabilistic description of a network which demonstrably captures its essential components relative to a given network analytical function. An additional complication concerning networks of interest to DARPA is that they are dynamic. Analytic functions of central importance rely on the ability to do and evaluate change detection. Network descriptions must, therefore, explicitly take temporal variation into account (e.g., using Markov Chains). Creating rigorous techniques for characterizing and validating the fidelity of the synthetic data is equally important.",450,3155,1,No,No,No,,"Consider the following social network analytical functions: 1. Determine the number of users in specific subpopulations, e.g., in age ranges, locations, etc. 2. Determine the patterns of interaction and friendship, and which subpopulations are interacting? What is the amount and frequency of interaction? When is it occurring (time of day, day of week, month of year)? 3. Determine whether the graph of interactions can be partitioned with small cuts? E.g., are there few links between users from different departments in an organization? Can the graph structure be characterized into collections of sub-graph types and do the sub-graphs have identifiable properties? 4. Determine whether the interaction patterns change/grow over time? How is the distribution of interaction between subpopulations shifting over time? • Task 1: For each of these functions, create a statistical/probabilistic time-varying description of a network which demonstrably captures its essential components relative to the function. • Task 2: Use the results of Task 1 to design and implement algorithms for generating corresponding high fidelity synthetic graph data. Devise techniques to rigorously characterize and validate the fidelity of the data. Describe the real graph data sets that will be used for prototype development and testing. Note that the data sets used are the sole responsibility of the performers – the government will not supply any data.","Extend the work of Phase I to the following network analytical functions: 5. Determine what can be learnt about the use of applications (such as games) in the network? E.g., how does their popularity spread over time and is this correlated with friendship links? 6.

Dried blood spot (DBS) samples are increasingly used in non-clinical drug development, newborn screening and therapeutic drug monitoring, and have demonstrated utility for blood sample transport from remote locations, simple stable storage and subsequent diagnostic analysis. Similarly, analyses have been demonstrated from other dried biological specimens, such as urine. Proposals are sought that will enhance the applicability of DBS samples and other dried biological specimen samples (e.g. urine, saliva, cerumen, feces) for DoD-relevant clinical analyses. Proposals may address all or one of the following aspects described below: 1) enhanced recovery of analytes, 2) improved materials for dried specimen cards, 3) automated processing of dried specimen samples—particularly if elements of integrated sample preparation are necessary to preserve the recovery of integrity of a given class of biomarker for later detection. Note that this research, especially the Phase I investigations, does not require use of patient-identified or disease-specific samples. Research could be performed using existing/exempt/synthetic samples, as appropriate for the proposed research and the performing institution. Proposers are encouraged to consider methods and technologies compatible with Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-waived analysis, good laboratory practices (GLP), and good manufacturing practice (GMP) procedures. 1) Typically, blood is the biological sample of choice for diagnostics, collected invasively in milliliter volumes, and requiring temperature controlled storage conditions. DBS are a convenient method for blood microliter volume sample collection, shipping and environmentally permissive storage. Since a very small blood volume is collected, any loss of analyte during elution from the DBS card decreases probability of detection, decreasing the sensitivity of the analysis. Therefore, enhanced recovery methods would improve detection probabilities. In addition, other biological samples (urine, saliva, cerumen, feces) are available in larger volumes and/or may easier to collect. Clinical utility of such samples also depends on the analyte integrity and concentration available for detection. Therefore, proposals are sought that address enhanced recovery of clinically relevant analytes from dried specimens. Proposal may address one or more clinical specimen type. Proposals should address sample integrity and quantitative recovery of proteins, lipids, sugars, nucleic acids, and small molecules, and aim to minimize recovery volumes and processing steps. Elution methods that comply with GLP and could be incorporated in a CLIA-waived device or analyzed in a CLIA-certified laboratory are encouraged. 2) Improvements in dried biological specimen absorptive platform materials may also optimize performance. Advances such as new materials or modification of existing materials for improved performance may be proposed. Efforts should address quantifiable improvements to be demonstrated with the new materials, such as shortened drying time, enhanced analyte stability/recovery (nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, sugars, and/or small molecules), or processing ease. Absolute dryness is not required; however, concentration of sample to a small volume that facilitates transport without cold storage or degradation is essential. Cost, shelf-life, and good manufacturing practice (GMP) procedures should be considered. 3) Dried biological specimen processing typically requires numerous manual sample preparation/processing steps. Technologies for automated processing of dried samples would reduce the level of operator skill required for analysis. Proposals should detail the methods to be used in the automated device and may address one or more biological specimen type. Quantitative recovery of proteins, lipids, sugars, nucleic acids, and small molecules is critical, and may be performed from separate dried specimen samples. Sample preparation methods must be compatible with standard post-processing analysis methods such as mass spectrometry, PCR assays, and immunoassays. Direct interface with analysis devices is encouraged. Device applicability to single patient and multi-patient sample processing should be described. Devices with potential for CLIA-waived or CLIA-moderate complexity compliance are encouraged.",625,4659,1,No,No,No,,"1) Initiate development of approaches for enhanced recovery of critical analytes from dried or preserved biological samples and demonstrate quantitative results using standard laboratory assays. The proposer should choose clinically relevant analytes that are currently challenging to recover due to low concentration in the specimen(s) (e.g., aM-pM) or degradation over time, and demonstrate an increased recovery of these analytes as compared to conventional methods. Proposers are also encouraged to demonstrate analyte recovery sufficient for analysis using partial dried specimen samples. 2) Initiate development of new materials. Demonstrate preliminary quantitative performance improvements using new materials for dried biological specimen absorptive platforms. Improvements may include decreased drying time, enhanced collection capability, enhanced analyte stability/recovery, or more facile processing of the dried or preserved sample. 3) Initiate development of automated sample processing technology of dried or preserved biological samples for purification of proteins, lipids, sugars nucleic acids, and/or small molecules. Consideration of integrated elements of sample preparation, if necessary to preserve integrity or stability, are encouraged.

Quantify performance of proposed algorithms with respect to figures of interest such as network size, desired throughput, etc.","The reliance on networks of all kinds is pervasive throughout the Department of Defense (DoD). Of particular and growing importance is the use of networks of distributed, low size, weight and power (SWAP) sensors of limited range that can, by acting cooperatively, provide widearea capability. The informative power of this capability is often directly dependent on the relative quality of communications, both intraand internetwork, that are available to the constituent nodes. Consequently, communication capacity emerges as a vital component of the networked system, and thus its integrity must be ensured. Encryption is typically employed to ensure communication security, but many cryptographic techniques rely on static configurations (e.g., the ability to ensure secure key distribution) to achieve the desired level of protection. Conversely, public key algorithms (PKAs) can be used in dynamic settings. However, standard implementations such as RSA or those based on discretelogarithms are computationally intensive and have not been designed for use in low SWAP environments. DARPA is interested in research and development into new classes of PKAs that are particularly well suited for low SWAP network settings.

SWIR FPAs are sensitive from the visible to short wave infrared with spectral band cutoff at 1.7um, where there is a large ambient signal level due to ""night glow.” In addition to sensitivity advantages, SWIR imaging adds the capability for covert illumination outside the spectral range of conventional low light level devices; the capability to detect hidden and camouflaged targets; and sensitivity to battlefield lasers and target designators. Widespread military application of these significant system performance advantages requires high quality SWIR FPAs affordable for general use in military systems. Recent improvements in SWIR detector and FPA technology have led to sensors with considerable system advantages. The dark current of shortwave sensitive material, indium gallium arsenide, has been substantially reduced, enhancing the signal-to-noise and increasing the operating temperature, ultimately with the potential for room temperature operation. Likewise, the noise of the readout integrated circuit has been reduced without sacrifice of dynamic range. Transition of these substantial performance improvements into affordable systems will establish digital low light level imaging for military systems. Successful transition of SWIR FPAs can be facilitated by a substantial reduction in the cost of SWIR imaging sensors. New sensor configurations and innovative system designs are needed to capitalize on the recent advances in material and device technology and establish an affordable SWIR camera technology. In current manufacturing approaches, SWIR FPAs are individual packaged and integrated with optics. A wafer scale approach for die packaging and optics integration would significantly reduce sensor cost. New sensor concepts are also needed to achieve large format arrays, providing large field of view, with high resolution focused on critical areas of interest in the scene.

Department of Defense (DoD) related applications including robust, synchronous optical networks, millimeter-wave radar, synthetic aperture and multi-static imaging, and precision time keeping require pure 10 GHz reference tones with low phase noise. Quartz crystal oscillators are pervasive in current systems due to their portability and reliability, but suffer from poor phase noise characteristics, making them unsuitable for many applications of interest [1]. Current commercial rack-mount state-of-the-art ultra-low noise oscillators are based on sapphire oscillators [2]. Lower phase noise oscillators close to a 10 GHz carrier frequency have recently been developed in a laboratory environment. These oscillators, based on optical frequency combs, have 10,000 times less phase noise close-to-carrier compared to any available commercial oscillator [3]. Such oscillators will prove invaluable in future military systems by, for example, enabling high bandwidth robust communication systems and improved resolution bistatic radar [4]. The advantage of laboratory-based frequency combs is derived from the division of stable optical to microwave frequencies produced by the frequency comb. However, several improvements are required to create a robust, portable system, including improving the phase noise at large carrier offsets ( > 10 kHz), and the miniaturization of the system to a rack mount device. To this end, several components must be improved and miniaturized with the final goal of low phase noise from 1 Hz to 1 MHz, and integration into a deployable oscillator system. Possible work includes, but is not limited to: comb miniaturization, development of acceleration-insensitive frequency-selective components, development of high linearity and high power photodiodes, development of 10 GHz repetition rate miniature frequency combs, and optimization and innovation to maintain performance in a rack mountable device. As an example of such work, consider photo-detector technology. At large frequency offsets (> 10 kHz) phase stability is limited by photocurrent shot noise due to detector saturation [3]. To reach the state-of-the-art level of 180 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, one would need to develop high linearity and high power photodiodes. Alternatively, one could make an array of independently-illuminated diodes which are monolithically integrated with an on-chip coherent power combiner to overcome the shot noise limit [5].",366,2583,1,No,No,No,,"Identify key components and technologies and define their contribution to the improvement and/or miniaturization of frequency comb based 10 GHz microwave oscillators.

Practitioners under extreme stress are routinely asked to enter unfamiliar situations in cultures alien to their own and conduct activities, adjudicate arguments, and facilitate life altering decisions. Enabling these complex social interactions affords improved performance (e.g., fewer misunderstandings, increased efficiency, better decisions). However, in order to train or provide feedback to individuals about their social interactions, one must first have an understandable way to capture and represent those interactions. Manual, ethnographic techniques provide significant insights, but are not scalable. Automated techniques involving wearable sensors and video processing show significant promise. However, these methods assume that all parties involved in an interaction are instrumented in a way that allows for subsequent data analysis. In many realistic situations, it is only possible to instrument one party in an interaction. For instance, emergency department staff involved in an on-the-job assessment could be instrumented while their patients could not. This limits the environments in which these technologies can be actively used to training and experimental venues, which lose real-world contextual cues critical in social interactions. This topic seeks innovative algorithmic approaches to ""filling in the gaps"" in social interactions when data collection systematically misses one party in bi-lateral and multi­-lateral social encounters.

The majority of these agents have been neutralized by bacterial selection and development of transmissible resistance, while the rest are prone to the same issues and may ultimately meet a similar fate. Ironically, the widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture and medicine has led to the emergence of ""super strains"" that are resistant to medical intervention. Acquired resistance compromises our ability to fight emergent bacterial threats in injured warfighters and our military treatment facilities. For burn patients in particular, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (ABC) is a common cause of nosocomial infection, causing severe morbidity as well as longer hospital stays. Typically, antimicrobial resistant infections require a hospital stay three times as long and are in excess of four times as expensive. Therefore, new and innovative methods to control bacterial infection in the military health system are of critical importance. Although broad spectrum antibiotics using a small molecule-based approach has been the historic solution, the time and money required to develop and obtain regulatory approval of new small molecule antibiotics has stifled production. For example, from 1983-1987 sixteen new antibacterial agents received FDA approval, while from 2003-2007 only four new agents were approved. Furthermore, many current and future small molecule agents would have limited applicability to engineered biological threats. Recent advances in nanomaterials, genome sequencing, nucleotide synthesis, and bioinformatics could converge in nanotherapeutics with tailored sequence, specificity, and function that can overcome earlier challenges. Collectively, these core technologies could permit the development of an innovative pharmaceutical platform composed of nanoparticles with tethered small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucelotides whose sequence and objective can be reprogrammed ""on-the-fly"" to inhibit multiple targets within multiple classes of pathogens. This topic is focused on the development of a revolutionary rapidly adaptable nanotherapeutic platform effective against evolving and engineered pathogens. The biocompatible materials used to fabricate the nanoparticle should optimize cellular targeting, intracellular concentration, target sequence affinity, resistance to nuclease, and knockdown of target genes. The platform should leverage state-of-the-art genomic sequencing and oligonucleotide synthesis technologies to permit rapid programmability against evolving biologic threats. Proposers should highlight the role of bioinformatics in the platform development and therapeutic design with an emphasis on using this information to: characterize pathogens that cannot be cultured; compare samples against a growing library of known pathogens; improve effectiveness of the recommended siRNA oligonucleotides; limit host transcriptome overlap and side effects; and potentially make recommendations on compassionate use in cases of life threatening pandemic infection.

Therapeutic interventions are sought that will be efficacious against a range of human pathogens of interest to the DoD.,"The combined threat of the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant bacteria and a diminishing antibiotic pipeline places our warfighters at risk not only from health care associated and community acquired infections, but also from pandemics, emerging infectious pathogens and the intentional use of resistant pathogens for bioterrorism. One of the major routes by which bacterial pathogens become resistant to antibiotics and more virulent is through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), which allows for genetic material transfer in the form of extrachromosomal plasmids from one cell to another. This phenomenon is capable of transferring resistance and/or virulence genes to normally antibiotic susceptible and avirulent bacteria. This creates a severe risk to front line antibiotic treatments, illustrated by the recent occurrence of isolates from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) that contain vancomycin resistance genes (in plasmid form) transferred from vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Likewise, G9241, a benign form of Bacillus cerus has acquired a B. anthracis virulence plasmid, demonstrating transfer of virulence plasmids by HGT. One way to reverse the resistance of emerging or engineered bacteria created by HGT may be to specifically target the plasmids being transferred between the cells, rather than using methods to directly kill the cells. This idea is known as Plasmid Curing. Proposals are sought that will develop novel plasmid curing therapeutics against plasmid encoded antibiotic resistant and highly virulent pathogens. Studies working with ESKAPE bacteria (Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and bacteria that produce Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) enzymes (Enterobacter and Escherichia coli)) are encouraged. The therapeutic should be clinically relevant and therefore shown to be non-toxic to humans and appropriate regulatory approval that would be needed in bringing forth such a therapeutic in the drug development pipeline should be considered.

In addition, these therapeutics can be used as a medical countermeasure against any pathogen that may strike the general population. Phase III and IND approval would lead to appropriate clinical trials to gain FDA approval that may be funded through additional government and/or private funding sources. This SBIR Topic addresses the biomedical key technology area identified in the Defense Technology Area Plan from February 2003. Specifically drug resistant microbes are a significant current and future threat to US military personnel deployed overseas. Military personnel suffer significant life and limb threatening injuries and survive or resuscitated only to face months of hospitalization and multiple surgeries trying to combat extensively antibiotic resistant microbial pathogens. In the current military medical system we encounter microbes that are not responsive to any known antibiotics. In addition, naturally emergent or purposely engineered extensively antibiotic resistant microbes pose a significant threat to military operational activities. Most antibiotic resistance and many virulence genes are carried on portable and easily transferable circles of DNA called plasmids that live inside bacteria. Research and development under our topic will identify innovative ways of “curing” plasmids, that is, to directly attack the plasmids instead of the bacteria. Although high risk, if successful this approach could open a new way of countering biological threats.",1,Infect Immun. 2011 Aug;79(8):3012-9.

State-of-the-art high-resolution magnetometers, Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQuIDs), are frequently found in medical devices for magnetoencephalography (MEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can operate at the nT/Hz^1/2 level but are limited to micron resolution, require cryogenic environments, and consume high power. An attractive means of boosting the sensitivity and resolution of modern magnetometers in a room temperature, low power and rugged device, is to employ optically-addressed ensembles of NV centers in diamond. As well as supplanting SQUIDS in medical applications, such magnetometers, with sub-micron spatial resolution, could be used in the non-destructive imaging of integrated circuits for the presence of malicious circuits. NV centers are atom-like defects in diamond that are highly sensitive to magnetic fields despite being embedded in the solid state. In fact, operation at the pT/Hz^1/2 level has been demonstrated and it is expected that nm-scale resolution can be achieved [1-4]. This approach is particularly exciting for biological and neuroscience applications because it works under ambient conditions (room temperature and pressure) without significantly affecting the operation. Furthermore, ensemble NV magnetometry offers a large field-of-view, a robust, solid state system and low noise optical preparation and detection. Because sensitivity scales as the square root of the number of NV centers [5], ensembles are essential to achieving high-sensitivity over a broad area. While impressive results have been obtained in the laboratory, significant development is necessary to construct a robust packaged imaging system with high-NV density and sufficiently narrow inhomogeneous broadening, reduced background noise and efficient collection efficiency. Methods of achieving the critical properties of a magnetic imager could include, but are not limited to, an improved collection efficiency with solid-immersion lenses [6], side collection schemes or anti-reflection coatings; reduced background noise with IR absorption spectroscopy [2] in a low finesse resonant cavity or obtaining high resolution with STED spectroscopy [7].",334,2433,1,No,No,No,,"Design a robust packaged magnetic field imaging system with an ensemble of NV centers in diamond.

At the same time, enabling the capability to self-collect a biospecimen could provide a means to more confidently diagnose or track disease at its earliest stages, provide an ability to better expand clinical trials into remote settings, and increase the diversity of population cohorts needed for biomarker research. For example, blood biospecimens are the biofluid of choice for most diagnostic applications but require trained phlebotomists to collect and process the biofluid. Simultaneously, there has been a push towards the miniaturization of detection technologies (eg. ""lab-on-a-chip” and ""nano-bio” technologies), but there has been a disconnect between sample acquisition and downstream analysis in a manner that allows for the detection of low abundance analytes. Aggressive low volume scaling through finger-stick or lancet components affords clear advantages for sample preparation, reagent usage, thermal load, manipulation, and reaction kinetics, but there is nevertheless the challenge of dealing with ""the law of small numbers”, or Poisson’s Law, which indicates that for small biospecimen volumes there may be no targets available for amplification or detection. In other words, diagnostic instruments may be developed that are small, portable, and require only a few drops of blood, but if the target analyte is not present in the small volume, the test could be susceptible to false negatives or not provide sufficient statistical confidence to provide clinical guidance. Additionally, biospecimens other than blood, such as sweat, interstitial fluids, or tears may have the potential to be a powerful natural repository of clinically relevant biomarkers but there lack the technologies for self-collection and concentration. Technologies that offer the simplicity of a finger stick device (as an example) with the capability to collect larger biospecimen volumes or weights would overcome a diagnostic hurdle that limits widespread diagnostic testing outside of traditional clinical settings such as a clinic or hospital. Therefore, proposals are sought that address large volume (eg. >100 ìL for blood) or weight biospecimen collection via a device that is simple to operate and minimally invasive. Proposers are encouraged to consider methods and technologies compatible with clinical workflows, good laboratory practices (GLP), and good manufacturing practice (GMP) procedures.",382,2633,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate feasibility of methods or technologies for large volume or weight collection. Proposers must address both the volume/weight of biospecimen collected, as well as address how device operation is conducted under conditions of minimal invasiveness and ease-of-use.

Collection devices may be designed to hold the collected biospecimen within the device or to dispense the biospecimen into an instrument or alternate storage device. Proposers should demonstrate initial designs and collection volumes/weights, and project Phase II collection volume/weight capabilities. Proposals that demonstrate universal compatibility for downstream analysis under a wide dynamic range of analytes are preferred. Of interest are quantitative metrics measured with a variety of protein, nucleic acid, metabolic and/or other analytes relevant to human biology. Phase I efforts should justify the applicability to settings such as home use, and consideration of FDA regulations is encouraged.","Phase II efforts should quantify collected biospecimen volume/weight and address reproducibility of the collection volume/weight with different prototypes under similar and different conditions. Detection of a panel of well-characterized, low abundance biomarkers should be demonstrated from collected samples using standard laboratory practices. Of interest are quantitative metrics measured with a variety of protein, nucleic acid, metabolite and/or other analytes relevant to human biology. Phase II efforts should evaluate the device effectiveness and reproducibility when operated by untrained users. Additional interests include demonstrations that the proposed technology is developed to include standardization/normalization of the biospecimen to reference analyte concentrations across collections, with sensitivities that can address sample variability. Manufacturing designs and costs should be considered for all components of the device. Compatibility of the collection device with downstream biospecimen storage devices and/or analysis technologies should be considered. Device potential for FDA clearance as a blood collection device for home use or physician office settings should be described.","The technology to be developed would enable blood collection outside of a major clinical facility and therefore would have significant impact on the clinical diagnostic market. There is a significant commercial market for medical diagnostics and home-use physician-office based diagnostic testing is a growing element of this market. The developed technology would allow collection of sufficient sample in such settings, enable clinically valid diagnostic testing and biomarker research. Potential commercial customers include diagnostics companies such as Roche Diagnostics or life sciences research technology companies such as Life Technologies. The technology to be developed is critical for DoD, as many medics have minimal training. Development of a FDA-approved collection device would enable use of newly developed diagnostic tests in remote/deployment settings as well as expand the military capabilities to perform more effective clinical trials of new therpeutics and diagnostics in remote settings or expand biosurveillance capabilities.

Thus, medical simulations have focused heavily on training specific skills and techniques as a surrogate to other modes of training. However, computer game-based technologies provide the opportunity to combine skills training with generalizeable educational principles. For example, instead of simply providing instruction on where to apply a tourniquet, a computer-based system can reinforce the lesson with demonstrations and discussion of the underlying physiology of the circulatory system. Thus, a student may learn why wounds in slightly different locations respond differently or why applying pressure in certain conditions is essential. The game-based approach also allows for integrating the lessons into dramatic and engaging scenarios. Combining skills training with the underlying STEM principles from biology/physiology should more readily allow for the generalization of the skills to novel situations. This tool is envisioned for both medical training and in basic civilian education science classes. The goal is to create a game-based application on mobile platforms to teach first responder principles that integrates intelligent tutoring systems to not only teach basic skills, but answer the underlying questions of why a student should or should not have responded the way they did. Using this application, students should learn BOTH basic skills and also basic principles of human physiology. Thus, this can be used as a classroom resource for science education as well as a resource to teach medical skills for first responders. The underlying architecture should allow for the analysis and optimization of the software to both the individual user and across the entire population of users. We are not seeking standard computer-based learning systems, but game-based interactive systems that are engaging and challenging to the user. Design and development should be to professional game standards and the proposed game concepts should be compelling, innovative, and designed to motivate users for continued interactions. Innovative approaches for visualization and interaction with these different types of information are required. The system should educate, train, and assess the student’s knowledge. The patient models should respond accurately and be based on underlying physiology models that respond appropriately to both injury and treatment. The simulation should include a case editing tool that instructors and students can use to customize injury scenarios. The system should be developed in such a way to allow customization of options for basic first responders with limited resources to more advanced options for Corpsmen/Medics/EMTs.

The power and brightness of state-of-the-art LDs are severely limited by catastrophic optical-damage (COD) at the front facet. COD severely limits the power/bar that could be attained and hence a larger number of LD bars are required for a given LD pump power. The larger number of bars increases system complexity and decreases efficiency of the high power laser system. In addition it results in an increase in size, weight and cost of the laser system. The focus of this SBIR is to significantly improve the reliability of high-power semiconductor LDs so they can be reliably operated at 6-7X higher power density per bar than the present state-of-the-art. Specifically, state-of-the-art 980nm, 20 percent fill-factor, 10mm wide bars operate at approximately 70W. Achieving this goal of 400-500W/bar may directly impact DARPA’s high-power fiber lasers such as Revolution in Fiber Lasers RIFL by increasing the specific power of laser diodes pumps from the present 1kW/kg to 6-7kW/kg. Since LD pumps contribute about 50% of the cost and weight of the high power laser system, increasing the specific power (kW/kg) will have a significant impact on the size of the high energy laser system. In addition, the cost of the laser diode pumps is inversely proportional to the power/bar and increase of 6-7x in power that could be obtained from a bar decreases the cost by a similar factor. The weight and cost of LD pumps is estimated to be approximately 50% of the laser system so decreasing them by 6X will decrease the all-important weight and cost of the HEL by 40%.

Low temperature growth (<= 400°C) is therefore required to ensure compatibility with existing laser diode processing and ultra-high vacuum (< 1e-9 Torr) is required to prevent oxidation of the cleaved surface. The passivation layer should fully passivate the facet and prevent the defects. It should also prevent absorption of the laser line.

They have found wide use in industrial and scientific applications ranging from cutting and welding to gravitational wave detection, and their small size makes them promising candidates for defense applications such as laser-based weapons and long-range lidar on airborne platforms. Fiber laser and amplifier systems can also be scaled to even higher power using coherent or spectral beam combining [1], but two competing nonlinear processes limit the power available from a single continuous-wave fiber amplifier and, by extension, the power from a beam-combined system. To achieve good efficiency, both coherent and spectral beam combining require the fiber lasers and amplifiers to have a narrow spectral bandwidth, but these narrow-band systems are very susceptible at high powers to stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), which is a nonlinear process that can scatter significant power backwards into the laser system. Several approaches have been used to suppress SBS, but the most common is to utilize short fibers with large cores to reduce the interaction length and lower the Brillouin gain [2]. Recently, a new modal instability has been identified that drastically reduces the output beam quality and limits the useful power from high-power beam-combinable amplifiers [3]. Experimental data show that a significant amount of signal power is coupled into higher-order optical modes of the fiber core and/or cladding when the average amplifier power exceeds a threshold on the order of 1 kW. Theoretical investigations into the mode-coupling mechanism and ways to mitigate it are not yet conclusive [4]. Smaller cores with fewer modes would reduce this instability but at the expense of higher Brillouin gain. One approach to reducing both SBS and modal instabilities is to use extremely short fibers with narrow cores that guide only a few modes, at most. However, short double-clad fibers require extremely bright pump lasers that are spectrally narrowed and locked to match the gain fiber’s absorption peak in order to efficiently absorb the pump light. Currently, state-of-the-art fiber-coupled diode pump lasers are limited to an ex-fiber brightness of ~25 MW/cm2sr, corresponding to 100 W from a fiber with a 105-µm core and 0.12 NA (numerical aperture) without wavelength stabilization [5], but this fiber-coupled spatial brightness is significantly lower than the record of 1 GW/cm2sr for a single diode laser [6,7]. This SBIR topic seeks innovative approaches to realizing a high-power wavelength-stabilized fiber-coupled diode laser system that employs extremely bright emitters to achieve an ex-fiber brightness >100 MW/cm2sr. The resulting pump laser module could be transitioned to multiple government-funded high-power laser programs or commercialized as a part of systems targeting industrial laser cutting applications.",451,3033,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate a single diode laser operating at ~976 nm with output power >10 W, spatial brightness >1 GW/cm2sr, and electrical-to-optical efficiency >52%. All three performance metrics should be achieved simultaneously on a single device. Develop a concept to package several of these emitters into a single wavelength-stabilized module that can achieve the Phase II performance metrics.","Construct and demonstrate a prototype laser system suitable for pumping high-power fiber lasers based on the Phase I module concept and diode emitters. The key performance goals are: 1) fiber-coupled power >500 W continuous-wave, 2) ex-fiber spatial brightness >100 MW/cm2sr, 3) >42% ex-fiber electrical-to-optical efficiency, 4) <0.25 nm full-width half-maximum output spectrum*, 5) Äë/ÄT < 0.07 nm/°C, 6) Äë/ÄP < 0.03 nm/W, and 7) specific weight <1 kg/kW of fiber pump power delivered. Conduct a preliminary reliability assessment. The final Phase II system should be at Technology Readiness Level 6. *The narrow spectral width is to allow the future potential for spectral beam combining to even higher spatial brightness within the narrow absorption peak of Yb-doped silica (~7 nm bandwidth).","Industrial applications include metal cutting, welding, and marking. A laser module meeting the Phase II metrics would have sufficient power and brightness for entry-level cutting applications, and several Phase II modules could be spectrally combined into a single kW-class fiber-coupled cutting system. Direct-diode lasers are of significant industrial interest because of their potential for higher reliability, better efficiency, and lower complexity than competing solid-state and fiber lasers [8]. Military applications include lidar and directed-energy weapons, and the Phase II technology could be potentially transitioned to multiple government directed-energy programs, including ongoing high-power fiber laser programs funded by DARPA and HEL-JTO, such as Excalibur. Once delivered, a fiber-coupled Phase II module could be readily spliced into an existing high-power fiber amplifier system, and new laser systems could be designed to exploit the brightness of these pump lasers. Since light-weight packaging would be developed during Phase II, Phase III development activities might include increasing output power, improving efficiency, and/or modifying the module for alternative thermal management techniques (e.g. phase change materials or spray cooling).",1,"S.

The rising need for communications in forests, jungles and triple canopy environments shows the importance of characterizing these RF environments. This will allow for real-time situational awareness, sensor and command and control data throughout the entire battle space. Traditional communications through dense foliage and vegetations is challenged by severe multipath and attenuation thereby limiting the warfighter’s access to critical data. There is little to no data on RF propagation across the entire frequency spectrum through the various foliage elements and current models, such as FOREST, typically view foliage environments as a uniform dielecteric slab and are limited by the assumptions that they treat forests as reasonably uniform, the floor as absorptive, and only address frequencies up to approximately 1 GHz. A model is needed that can address the entire range of spectum, including current military radio systems, new 4G wireless technologies, millimeter wave communications (30-300 GHz), and can be equally applied to forest and jungles that are assumed to be non-uniform.

Collaboration with multi-national forces is nothing new, but the CSpOC’s multi-level security environment poses new challenges for human-system interfaces and collaboration technology. There is currently no way to visualize the human-centric planning, operations, tasking, organization, and communication needed to coordinate information throughout the multi-national Space Situational Awareness (SSA) enterprise. Effective coordination among multi-national forces requires continuous and rapid information sharing, group problem solving, error-checking, and progress monitoring. All of these and possibly other capabilities are needed to support independent and interdependent tasks for plans, operations, intelligence, logistics, communication-computers, and (to a lesser extent) combat service support. These team members will need a decision-centric team environment supporting individual and group work flows and processes.

Among the challenges for SSA is the capability to maintain active custody of individual satellites. Some objects are frequently lost and sometimes serendipitously reacquired without recognition of its previous catalog existence unless manpower-intensive analysis intervenes to uncover the situation for some cases. Maintaining custody of a large number of satellites is a leap in capability requiring innovative solutions that are amenable to automation in order to be feasible for implementation. The challenge of maintaining custody is magnified in certain crowded regions of space by the sheer number of objects present, the fact that most active satellites perform periodic but unannounced maneuvers for orbit and/or attitude corrections, dynamical models are approximate, and a certain number of faint objects are marginally detectable thus forming a sort of background clutter. Active custody encompasses the indication for when objects are missing, action to identify and search likely regions for reacquisition, and positive identification of a reacquired object as the previously missing object. Timeliness and accuracy in the identification of reacquired objects are key performance metrics. Positive identification of satellites is linked to defining signatures that are predictable and uniquely indicating the presence of some feature(s) of an object, manifesting from its physical and/or operational attributes. For objects in space, signatures may stem from any observable phenomenology that may be remotely sensed from ground-based or space-based instrumentation. A collection of appropriately selected signatures may be sufficient to unambiguously identify individual satellites, even among those of common manufacturers and of similar bus types. Combining signature information with orbital dynamics modeling may increase confidence in the identification of reacquired objects.",297,2146,1,No,No,No,,"Develop an initial concept design and model key elements for a feasible approach to establish and maintain positive identification of individual satellites, including active payloads and tumbling objects.

However, bonded composite aircraft structures continue to be a challenge to manufacture due to the certification requirement to determine the strength of the bonds in the structures - before they are placed into service. Current testing techniques involve statically loading the bonded structure to some specified load level to place the bond line under load. If the bond does not fail, it is determined to be acceptable and the structure is placed into service. This test method is costly and time consuming to undertake. There is a need to be able to ""proof” test these bonds to quantify their strength with an efficient nondestructive method. A reliable and repeatable system for inspecting bonds would eliminate the need for full scale load testing resulting in a savings of $20 million in the aerospace industry alone. Recent developments with the use of well controlled stress waves have been demonstrated to be able to locally proof test the bond line. This bond inspection method has been matured for the inspection of non-confined structures. Non-confined bonded structures include wing skins bonded to the main spar or other internal structures. Challenges to implementation of an inspection process include the identification of data and inspection criteria/requirements (to address confined bonded structures and to define the system requirements for the inspection of these confined structures). The laser bond inspection process may provide verification of a successful bond and obviate the need for expensive global proof load tests. Discussions with Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)/Tier 1 designers and nondestructive inspection (NDI) personnel have yielded insufficient definition of these inspection requirements, as the designers often make design choices based on available NDI capability. NDI personnel would like the design community to provide requirements on what NDI resolution is needed for the structure. This leaves NDI equipment providers at a disadvantage and impedes further development of technology needed for the equipment/method to inspect primary bonded structures. The nondestructive inspection method shall be capable of proof testing the strength of confined adhesively-bonded composite structures. The identification of the confined structures with an OEM is to be used to determine the equipment requirements for the system to inspect confined structures. The research should identify approaches for measuring the strength and then demonstrating the ability to actually quantify the strength of a confined structure.",399,2724,1,No,No,No,,"Define the requirements for inspection system hardware that can quantify the strength of adhesive bond joints in composite structures, such as Pi joints that are contained within confined spaces.

Access to these volumes has generated new insights through data-driven methods in commerce, science, and computing sectors. Processing data at the requisite scale now requires specialized databases or clusters of computers, necessitating distributed computing paradigms for data ingestion, transformation, and loading for distributed computation. Therefore it is critical to develop fast, scalable, and efficient indexing schemes for data that not only support data ingestion and transformation but also enable fast search and analytics. Bulk data processing models like MapReduce enable users to leverage the power of thousands of commodity machines with little programming effort within easy-to-use software stacks [1]. Its open source implementation Hadoop has been primarily used to index large collections of text documents for search by exact match string comparison [2-4]. However, little progress has been made in indexing heterogeneous scientific data: semi-structured documents with meta-data and free-text, schema-less structured files, spatial measurements from sensors, categorical data with possibly missing values, noisy measurements, video, speech, graphical/networked information, as well as other data types coming from scientific measurements by instruments. In this solicitation, we seek new indexing schemes for large heterogeneous scientific data that operate within a cloud-computing framework. As most existing implementations of MapReduce do not provide underlying data indexing, new indexing schemes are sought to improve performance for jobs that join data across distinct inputs as well for jobs requiring more descriptive classes of search criteria. Schemes are also sought that support iterative algorithms and successive search refinement, which arise in applications such as mining, ranking, traversal, and parameter estimation. A technical challenge to building indices is to address uncertainty in data that has the potential to bias resultant analysis and lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, it is infeasible for a sensor database to contain the exact value of each sensor at all points in time. This uncertainty is inherent from measurement and sampling errors as well as from resource limitations. In categorical data, a correct value of an attribute is often unknown but may be selected from a number of alternatives. Current research and technology does not incorporate a rigorous method for representing, propagating, or manipulating this type of uncertainty. We seek index structures for efficiently searching uncertain categorical data as well as index structures that intentionally approximate values for speed and efficient implementation, along with corresponding performance guarantees from the probabilistic queries they enable. Another challenge is indexing scientific data using both foreground and background information. The effectiveness of text indices for reliable web search can partly be attributed to the inverted index, where both term frequency and inverse document frequency contribute to the match between document and query. There are not well developed analogues to this combination for scientific data, and therefore we seek novel approaches for indexing scientific data that include similar foreground and background information toward a relevant match. Finally, efficient indexing methods for streaming data are lacking. Existing cloud-computing methods primarily focus on storage and query techniques for sets of static data. We also seek indexing schemes designed to operate on data that appear as continuous and rapid streams. The effort should also develop data annotations to provide an effective means to link data from diverse archives to a domain conceptualization, e.g., a formal vocabulary or grammar, which then provides users with an integrated view for querying the data.",569,3994,1,No,No,No,,"• Task 1: Develop an approach for scientific data with foreground and background information. • Task 2: Develop an approach for indexing data with uncertainty. • Task 3: Develop indexing methods for streaming data. • Task 4: Extend methods to indexing heterogeneous data sets. • Task 5: Implement a minimal proof-of-concept system with sample scientific datasets. Phase I deliverables should include a Final Phase I report that includes: (1) a detailed description of the approach (or algorithms), and benefits of the selected approach over other alternatives; (2) an implementation architecture that integrates tasks 1-4; (3) a demonstration of the approach using the proof-of-concept system on a small cloud.","Develop a scalable implementation of the methods.

The Final Report will include (1) a detailed design of the system, documentation, and technical and user manuals, and (2) a plan for Phase III.","Being able to efficiently and effectively index large scientifically collected data would impact many DARPA efforts to build and deploy instruments such as sensors. Also, it would enable new classes of problem solving in the information processing domain relevant to several on-going efforts at DARPA. The Department of Defense has many applications where scientifically collected information is unable to be stored and used in later stages of information processing and decision making because of size and inherent format. Unlike text documents and reports, where indexing and processing have been standard, scientific data such as sensor measurements have not been effectively incorporated into the process.",1,"Tamer Elsayed, Ferhan Ture, and Jimmy Lin, Brute-Force Approaches to Batch Retrieval: Scalable Indexing with MapReduce, or Why Bother?

As a result, the state of the art development cycle for engineering new biologically based products and capabilities often takes 7+ years and costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars (e.g. microbial production of artemisinic acid for the treatment of malaria and the non-petroleum-based production 1,3-propanediol). The impact of current approaches is two-fold. First, the number of new entrants and innovators into both the commercial and research space is immediately limited – few have the expertise, capital and/or time necessary to develop and engineer a new product. Second, combined with the inherent complexity of biology, an ad hoc approach often results in one-off efforts that are limited to modifying only a small set of genes and constructing simple, isolated systems and devices. Consequently, while progress has been made, we are constrained to producing only a tiny fraction of the vast number of possible chemicals, materials, diagnostics, therapeutics, and fuels that would be enabled by the ability to truly engineer biology. A new approach is needed. Engineering biology with useful complexity requires new approaches for synthesizing, assembling, and manipulating genetic designs rapidly, cheaply, and accurately. The goal is to shift the designers’ mindset towards design and experimentation and to facilitate more complex, previously unattainable system designs and architectures. Unlike computer programming, where writing and producing variants of new code is essentially free, the synthesis and assembly of large DNA constructs (the writing of ‘biological code’) is expensive ($0.40 – $0.80 per bp), slow (2wks – 2mos turn time), error prone (~10-2 – 10-3), and limited in length and complexity (typically <5 kbp; A/T and G/C rich sequences are challenging or impossible to construct). These limitations restrict biological designers to constructing conservative, evolutionary designs, with little room for multiple design refinements, variants or new ideas. The ability to synthesize, modify and test many new designs (up to the genome scale) with little overhead will help to inform and create the biological design rules and tools that are necessary for the complex design and development of new biologically-based products and devices. This solicitation is focused on development of a platform, based on novel DNA synthesis and assembly techniques, that can produce error-free, 20 kbp lengths of DNA at scale with a reduced cost per base pair (<$0.05/bp) and rapid turn time (<1wk) compared to the state of the art.

However, they are each independent and geographically disparate, and each location develops its own methodology to simulate the space environment based on the numbers of degree of freedom’s the facility has at its disposal. The problem to solve is a common set of simulation software that is able to link each of these various N-DOF’s together into a real-time 6-DOF simulation that could run concurrent test operations at a fraction of the cost of flying similar systems in space. Goal is to develop a nationally linked test and operations methodology that can train, increase the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and demonstrate low cost space technology using the high number of separated multi-DOF test beds around the nation. The objectives is to link in 3-D visualization technology with test beds for full scale DOF flight operations and methodologies, demonstrated using various N-DOF geographically distributed test beds that concentrate on robotic dynamics, orbital contact dynamics and 1-G contact dynamics. Relevance to DoD/DARPA will include a never before demonstrated methodology to train multiple personnel (from students to professional engineers) on upcoming techniques for rendezvous proximity operations in space, and to develop a methodology to test both hardware and techniques in terrestrial test beds at a cost point that has here-to-fore never been achieved except by going into space.

The stability and accuracy of these devices impact the performance of communication, navigation, surveillance, and missile guidance systems. Atomic clocks are at the core of these systems, either directly or via time-transfer from a master clock. Currently, the most stable clocks rely on ultra-stable Fabry-Perot laser cavities for short-term clock stability. However, to achieve sub-hertz linewidths, these cavities require a vibration-solated, temperature-controlled environment. In order for optical clocks to operate in fieldable devices, the environmental sensitivity of the laser oscillators must be mitigated and the cavity size reduced. If such isolation and miniaturization is achieved, optical clocks may enable secure data routing, communication systems that are insensitive to jamming, higher-resolution coherent radar, and more reliable and robust global positioning. Furthermore, reduced environmental sensitivity may lead to commercialization of frequency-stable laser technology. State-of-the-art frequency-stable laser cavities rely on the length-stability of a mechanical structure built from low expansion glass. Thermo-mechanical noise in the optical mirror coatings has been identified as the fundamental effect that limits the length, and hence, frequency stability of these cavities. Furthermore, laser cavities must operate inside a low-noise laboratory due to vibration and orientation sensitivity. This research will help develop fieldable versions of the world’s narrowest linewidth lasers and, thus, lead to improvements in secure data routing, communication systems that are insensitive to jamming, higher resolution coherent radar, and more reliable and robust global positioning and precision time keeping.

Approaches for a monolithic, high-quality optical whispering gallery mode resonator would be of interest. Such resonators should be highly portable with sizes on the millimeter scale, and would not suffer from thermal noise due to optical coatings.

As a result, the development effort devoted to the design of operator interfaces for remote teleoperation has been limited. Thus, significant training time for operators that will be using existing robotic systems is required, particularly for unmanned ground systems (UGV’s). Even with such training, maintaining an acceptable operation tempo for explosive ordnance disposal and surveillance operations is difficult. Recent significant improvements in small and efficient terrain surveillance sensors will provide a basis for improved low­ level autonomy that can reduce operator loading.

If possible, the development of this ontology should be directed towards its becoming an open and public standard. • A catalog of action scenarios and sub­ states of these scenarios, including terrain conditions that will encompass the range of situations that might be encountered in operational conditions. • A catalog of display techniques for enhancing situation understanding and supporting effective operator­-robot control interaction.

Improved operator interface design science should also reduce training time and increase ease of use. Robots are also in limited use in manufacturing fabrication and logistics. One problem area is reprogramming such systems for changes in production schedule or component design. Better operator interface designs should reduce the skill levels required.

The majority of these measurements suffer from poor reliability and utility because of biospecimen-related issues such as: delay in information caused by overnight shipping to a centralized laboratory&#894; pre-analytical variability associated with collection, processing and handling&#894; and the inability to account for intra-patient variability (such as diet, diurnal variations, exercise, etc.). There is a need to develop health diagnostic tools that are not dependent on the collection of a biospecimen and have the ability to continuously measure biomarkers directly and in real-time. Continuous monitoring of transient biomarkers using implantable sensors is extremely challenging. Current sensor technologies are limited by factors such as device size, biofouling, clinical accuracy, limited multiplex capability, and lack of quality receptors for clinical analytes. Advances are needed to address materials issues related to biocompatibility and sensor design issues related to analytical performance. In addition, robust receptors and affinity reagents are needed to allow measurement of a diversity of analyte classes and types. For example, glucose oxidase is widely used for glucose detection but expansion of this technical approach to exploit other optimized enzymatic reactions for the diagnosis or monitoring of other disease conditions is limited to the availability of enzymes or receptors that are fit for in-vivo use. Proposals are sought for technology solutions capable of continuous or near-continuous measurements of biomarkers without the need to extract and transport a biospecimen. Proposers are encouraged to: consider platform approaches that can be used to develop reagents that expand continuous monitoring capabilities to other analytes beyond glucose, consider targets that meet current needs in US healthcare, to develop technologies that could also be applied toward the measurements of non­ metabolite biomarker classes (such as proteins and nucleic acids), and develop a plan that if technically feasible would address a pathway toward appropriate regulatory clearance.",324,2295,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate in vitro feasibility of reagents/receptors/devices to continuously and reliably measure clinically relevant biomarkers over a duration of time using a wide, physiologically-relevant concentration range in buffered media.

Proposals addressing only receptor or enzyme development should demonstrate preliminary results appropriate for the maturity of the method, and address how their approach can be applied to a variety of detection technologies. Proposals focusing on device development should justify how the chosen conditions mimic the targeted sampling site in-vivo. For example, biofouling issues differ for devices implanted within interstitial and capillary sites, and proposals should address plans for overcoming such challenges. Device designs should describe how other effects common to foreign body implantation and residence ­ such as localized inflammation, device encapsulation, and toxicity/degradation - are addressed. Approaches should also address anticipated lifetime of the device (with a goal of minimizing surgical implant/removal procedures), calibration methodology, and data retrieval. Methods that are in accordance or exceed those outlined in U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations are encouraged.","Proposals developing new receptors or synthetic enzyme production methods should demonstrate and quantitate the production (e.g. yield) and the performance of the receptor. Such approaches should aim to be agnostic to the detection technology. For device development, develop and optimize an integrated prototype device capable of achieving the objective goals as described above. In vitro experiments should be conducted using biospecimens and/or animal models appropriate for the biomarker target and sampling site. Experiments should use metrics that demonstrate minimal biofouling effects, optimized specificity and sensitivity, maintained calibration over a time period that reflects the residence time of the device within the user, and methods for data output. Efforts should demonstrate technologies using clinically relevant sample concentrations. Device potential for FDA clearance as a continuously monitored and implanted device should be described.","The technology to be developed is applicable to continuously monitor physiological chemistry for diagnosis or performance measurements. There is a significant commercial market for medical diagnostics, particularly those currently involved in the development of technologies capable of the continuous monitoring of glucose and other metabolites. The developed technology would allow improvement of existing tests for diabetes and expansion of tests for monitoring of additional health conditions.

Massive amounts of social network data are collected for military, government and commercial purposes. Social network analytics are used to both discover social networks within larger populations and to gain an understanding of these networks. This includes understanding the various network topologies, interactions within and between social networks, mapping information flows as wells as the flows of more abstract concepts such as memes, power/influence, and control. In effective analysis systems, visualizations are tuned to a problem space (i.e. analytic), a data set, and a user community. This leads to a time-consuming process of knowledge engineering, design and software engineering. At the same time, the problem space is constantly and rapidly changing. That is, the characteristics of networks we need to identify and understand are changing at a pace well inside the design & engineering times of the tools being built to provide analytical capabilities. This is due to changes in operational problems and behaviors of social networks as well as advances in collection that make new analyses possible. Current visualizations of social network data are primarily limited to link-node diagrams which have been shown to be only minimally effective in providing a deep understanding of a number of critical aspects of social networks. Therefore, a new approach is required - the dynamic generation of visualizations (and interactions). There has been a good amount of work in this area with some limited successes. However, in recent years, research in the human visual system has made great strides and can provide a rich source of information for the effective and efficient presentation of information to users. DARPA is interested in the development of a corpus of cognitive and design ‘first principles’ and the demonstration and development of a system that can dynamically generate visualizations and interactions from these first principles based on interactions with users. Along with the corpus, an algorithmic approach to application and combination of these principles combined with goal definition and prioritization from the user will need to be developed. As user goals, prioritization, and data change, the system will dynamically create visualizations that are optimally tuned to the problem and user.",368,2437,1,No,No,No,,"• Task 1: Develop an approach for capturing and encoding design rules and cognitive principles. The rules should be as close to ‘first principles’ as possible and handle meta-rules as well (valid combination of ‘first principles’). • Task 2: Develop an approach for the application and combination of the corpus of principles (from task 1). Task 3: Populate the corpus with a sufficiently large set of cognitive and design principles to demonstrate the approach. • Task 4: Develop an architecture and conceptual design for the implementation of a dynamic system based on the corpus of principles developed in task 3. • Task 5: Implement a minimal proof-of-concept system that can take some set of principles and generate visualizations based on user inputs for goals, data, and prioritization of output.

Proposed concepts should focus on long term center frequency and bandwidth stability in addition to closed-loop control for microsecond-range frequency and bandwidth tuning over a wide spectral field of regard.,"Frequency-agile, waveform-agnostic cognitive and software-defined radios have been proposed as solutions to the growing problems of co-site interference and adversarial jamming encountered by modern military communication systems. Furthermore, the military and commercial industry have significant interest in developing widely deployed handheld radios with cognitive behavior; therefore, systems with low size, weight, power and cost are of primary importance. An essential and enabling component for such platforms are pre-select banks of low-loss filters capable of center-frequency, bandwidth and shape-factor tuning and adaptable intermediate frequency (IF) filters. Currently available static filters offer low loss and small form-factor but are not compatible with widely-tunable front-ends needed for true cognitive radio functionality. Consequently, significant research has been invested in developing MEMS, lumped-element, and cavity filters exhibiting adaptable bandwidth and wide (octave or greater) center-frequency tuning ranges. A significant remaining challenge, however, is tuning a given filter to a specific desired center frequency and bandwidth quickly and with commensurately short settlement times, particularly if the filter exhibits a high quality factor. Furthermore, any frequency-tunable element is susceptible to gradual drift with temperature or other factors that mandate continual stabilization through the use of a closed-loop control mechanism. The goal of this STTR topic is to conceptualize and successfully demonstrate innovative closed-loop control mechanisms for the purposes of long-term frequency stability and microsecond-range tuning authority for RF or IF filter banks with low volume and power consumption while retaining high quality factor over a wide spectral field of regard (20 MHz – 30 GHz). This tuning mechanism should be intimately integrated with the tunable filter, either through monolithic single chip fabrication or through advanced heterogeneous integration capabilities. Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility is not explicitly required, but the advantages of co-integration with CMOS are highly valued in both commercial and military applications. The quality factor and tuning characteristics of the filter should be maintained with the introduction of closed loop control.",316,2359,1,No,No,No,,Conceptualize and design a closed-loop tuning mechanism for a bank of multiple tunable filters for RF pre­ selection over the range of 20 MHz – 30 GHz or a bank of multiple tunable IF filters.

Tuning speed should account for ringing effects. Phase I deliverables will include simulation results of the proposed control concept and the path forward for fabrication in a well­ established process.,Proposers will integrate the control mechanism with a tunable filter bank in a well established process and validate the Phase I simulation results.

Proposed concepts should focus on center frequency and bandwidth tuning over a wide spectral field of regard and should clearly identify benefits over the current state-of-practice.","Modern military and commercial communications systems often employ several dedicated front­end chains to provide coverage for a variety of wireless standards or waveforms. For instance, it is not uncommon for 4th generation cellular telephones to comprise dedicated receive chains for 802.11 WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth and one or more cellular standards. Typically preceding each receive chain is a dedicated static filter designed to reject out-of-band signals that could potentially saturate the low-noise amplifier or create undesirable mixing products. Since these filters are static in frequency and bandwidth, the functionality of such radios is essentially set at design time. Consequently, they are incapable of dynamically reacting to changing operating conditions that might render a certain channel undesirable. The military is extremely interested in enabling this type of capability in its handheld and vehicle­ mounted communications systems due to the growing threat of intentional adversarial jamming and increasing spectrum crowding from co-site transmitters. An emerging solution to the interference issue is the development of cognitive radio platforms that can tune on-the-fly to operate in under-utilized spectrum. A key enabling technology is a bank of front­end filters that can respond to changing conditions by tuning center frequency, bandwidth and/or shape factor. Current state-of-the-art RF filters such as surface acoustic wave (SAW) or bulk acoustic wave (BAW) offer high quality factor, low volume and low power consumption&#894; however, their tunability is severely limited or non­existent. The DARPA/MTO Adaptive RF Technology program has invested in tunable banks of RF-preselect filters&#894; however, these filters are relatively wide in bandwidth and are large compared to state-of-the-art SAW and BAW filter implementations. The goal of this STTR topic is to conceptualize and successfully demonstrate innovative tunable RF for IF filter banks with low volume and power consumption while retaining high quality factor over a wide, military-relevant spectral field of regard (20 MHz – 30 GHz). Ideally, the fabrication process for these filters would be fully CMOS-compatible. Alternatively, proposers could demonstrate the feasibility of a seamless heterogeneous post­ CMOS integration process. Bandwidth, quality factor and filter shape should be specific to waveforms of interest that are clearly defined in the proposals. Likewise, input and output impedances are not limited to 50 Ohms&#894; however, the choice of such impedances should be clearly justified as being compatible with a typical front­end system including assumptions for antenna and LNA impedances.",387,2702,1,No,No,No,,"Conceptualize and design a bank of multiple tunable filters for RF pre-selection over the range of 20 MHz – 30 GHz or a bank of multiple tunable IF filters.

Develop and demonstrate a fabrication method to array the seeds in a matrix with orientational control of two crystal axes. Demonstrate the consolidation of the seeded matrix into a single crystal in the solid state.,"Single crystals are conventionally produced by directional solidification from the melt. They are difficult to scale up and usually require extensive machining to form near net shaped components. Significant cost reductions could be achieved by combining powder metallurgy with single crystal growth in the solid state. Advances in templated grain growth suggest the possibility for production of true single crystals in the solid state. A key need to make this a reality is the production of uniform, faceted seed crystals that can be oriented (with 2 crystal axes) in a powder matrix and consolidated via sintering followed by secondary grain growth to form single crystals. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is proposed as a model material because of its desirable ferroelectric and photorefractive properties. Processes with potential for chemical synthesis of seed crystals include hydrothermal, sol-gel, or other methods that allow control of the particle surface. Success in this endeavor may be transitioned to other single crystal materials with additional functional (i.e., electronic, magnetic, acoustic or optical) properties. The BaTiO3 seed crystals should be uniform in size and shape, with a nominal diameter of 50 microns and a narrow size distribution. The growth of uniform size and shaped seed crystals will be facilitated by development of synthesis methods with fine control of nucleation and growth processes. Precipitating crystals in polymer gels for example, has been used by Henish to suppress nucleation rates (7). Reactor design may also be important in achieving the topic goals. Plug flow reactors for example provide a uniform time – temperature profile for the product. Fluidic Self Assembly technology (8) of chips provides an example of how seed crystals might be placed in ordered arrays. Processes that use surface tension to orient the crystal may also be feasible. Pick and place methods would be challenging at small size scales. Successful development of processes to grow single crystals via self-assembly would enable growth of shaped crystals not easily made by conventional melt processes.",324,2125,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a reliable and reproducible process to produce uniform sized faceted barium titanate single crystals, with a narrow size distribution centered around 50 micron diameter.

The product will provide real-time, quantitative assessments of neural activity, utilizing display and analyses platforms people already own.","EEG technologies provide recordings of electrical brain activity with millisecond scale temporal resolution. These devices are used extensively in research and medical communities, including triaging for traumatic brain injury (TBI; Naunheim et al., 2010), because of their unparalleled temporal fidelity and non-invasive nature, using electrodes placed on the scalp. More recently EEG has been used in neuromarketing and to provide neurofeedback with brain computer interfaces to allow people to move objects or play computer games with their mind. Despite these advantages and applications of EEG, historically the devices and analysis software are too expensive to promote use by a wide audience. Current research-grade EEG devices are also unappealing for the general population, with gel-based electrodes and cumbersome software programs, and unwieldy for military operational use, with many recording electrodes and wires. The commercial systems that are available and could potentially be used by a wider audience either remain expensive, are scientifically suspect, or are not flexible with regards to electrode number and placement. Industry has recognized the need for a portable, easy-to-use EEG and a number of companies have developed simplified systems. Many of these devices, which cost $500 for the headset, are plagued by high artifact in recordings and do not provide the fidelity of data needed for valid research and operational use. These devices are typically comprised of one or only a handful of sensors with fixed locations on the scalp. This low number and lack of flexibility in recording locations drastically limits the ability to use these devices to collect quality recordings for research. Typically these commercially available portable EEG systems are used for biofeedback and gaming communities. Portable EEG systems that do provide research quality data are prohibitively costly for use by a wide audience, costing over $25k per EEG system. There is a great need for inexpensive and easy to use neural recording devices. Having EEGs in every classroom in America would engage students in science and technology in a way not previously possible in the field of neuroscience. Teachers could design lesson plans in biology about the brain and sensory systems, and use hands-on demonstrations to engage students. Students could record their own brain activity and download the data to their iPad. Including EEGs in basic military first aid kits would also help with both medical diagnostics and clinical care for deployed soldiers. Portable EEGs could be used in the field, with data sent to a corresponding app on a smartphone for near-instantaneous analysis. The Department of Defense has an interest in encouraging science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pursuits, and developing a low-cost, flexible EEG device with advantages over state of the art technologies would allow many researchers to address basic and applied EEG issues in a DoD-salient fashion, ranging from building algorithms to detect incipient sleep, to diagnosing or triaging pre-clinical Post Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms, to providing low-cost interfaces for computer training and education which modulate student feedback based on brain state. The proposed device would provide three significant advantages over current technologies: 1) a reduced price, costing around $30 to allow widespread use by schools and average citizens, 2) easy to use sensors that could be placed in multiple locations on the head to record activity in various brain regions, and 3) the ability to download information directly to a personal tablet or mobile phone without requiring a proprietary interface or dongle. By funding a small business with expertise in developing a portable EEG, DARPA stands to make unprecedented strides in this technology. Focusing on reducing the cost and increasing the operational ease of use for both EEG recordings and analyses will revolutionize public- and military-based access to brain science. With public-access to brain recording devices and apps, the field of cognitive neuroscience will be able to take advantage of crowd-sourcing to solve complex neuroscience problems. What challenges one laboratory of neuroscientists or even a field of scientists cannot answer, people everywhere will be able to solve collectively (Ekins and Williams 2010, Howe 2008).",664,4406,1,No,No,No,,"Develop an initial concept design and model key elements for a low-cost, portable EEG system.

EEG crowd-sourcing systems could attack multiple areas discussed above, ranging from brain-computer interfaces to driving innovative feedback regimes for digital tutor or electronic learning systems (including extant systems being acquired by the Navy and other DoD entities for operational use). Many commercial entities would have interest in a low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use EEG. Potential marketplace applications exist in neuro-marketing, gaming, politics, and many other fields. In addition to Army medics, civilian doctors could use this device for triaging TBI patients in hospitals. A great opportunity exists in the STEM education field as well. Placing these devices in every school would provide an invaluable resource to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers in America and would provide an unprecedented opportunity for crowd-sourcing in the general population.",1,"Naunheim RS, Treaster M, English J, Casner T, Chabot R. 2010.

Examples include: supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, medical devices, computer peripherals, communication devices, and vehicles. Networking these embedded systems enables remote retrieval of diagnostic information, permits software updates, and provides access to innovative features, but it also introduces vulnerabilities to the system via remote attack. A study by Cui and Stolfo [1] showed that there exist an extensive number of unsecured, embedded, networked devices that are trivially vulnerable to exploitation by remote attackers. Furthermore, a recent report by McAfee Labs [2] predicted that in 2012, industrial threats to SCADA systems and industrial controller systems (ICS) will mature and segment and that embedded hardware attacks will widen and deepen. The state of the practice of security for traditional IT systems is anti-virus scanning, intrusion detection systems, and a patching infrastructure. This approach does not work well in the IT space for a variety of reasons, including its focus on known vulnerabilities and the fact that security code can itself introduce new vulnerabilities. Attempts to port these approaches to embedded systems are unlikely to be any more successful because embedded systems impose additional difficulties, such as, strict resource constraints, hard real-time performance requirements, reliability over long periods of time, and the need for extensive verification and validation before patches can be installed [3]. Currently, only a small amount of research has been dedicated to developing techniques for detecting and patching vulnerabilities in embedded systems [4]. DARPA seeks to develop novel technology for automatically detecting and automatically patching vulnerabilities in networked, embedded systems. The technology should represent practical and effective techniques that can be applied to a wide-range of embedded system platforms. In addition, the techniques should be versatile such that it can be implemented on systems externally networked by various mechanisms, including, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radios, etc. In the defense sector, this technology will lead to more secure military systems ranging from unmanned ground, air and underwater vehicles, to weapons systems, satellites, and command and control devices.

Empiric depth and time limits were found to reduce gas bubble formation in tissues that caused the ""bends”. We continue to limit adverse physiology – now expanded to include decompression sickness (DCS), oxygen toxicity, inert gas narcosis, and high pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) – primarily by breathing static gas mixtures at prescribed pressures and durations. Longstanding US Navy dive regulations and technologies mandate use of standard gas mixtures, rate of descent, rate of ascent, depth, and bottom time. While dive technology has changed little in the last two decades, recent advances in applied physiology and microsystems technology could coalesce into revolutionary capability. Nitric oxide (NO) is an example of a gas that could be dynamically added to the inhaled gas mixture to improve dive operations and safety. Although trace gases such as NO were traditionally considered ""poisons”, they are now known as naturally occurring biomolecules that play a critical role in cellular signaling and metabolism. Of relevance to the current topic, inhaled NO relaxes blood vessels and increases tissue perfusion with a rapid onset/offset of action. Within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Rapid Altitude and Hypoxia Acclimatization (RAHA) program, inhaled NO was found to improve tolerance to hypoxia. In the dive environment, NO donors such as nitroglycerin also have been shown to decrease incidence of DCS. Of note, inhaled NO is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Combining the physiologic effect of inhaled gases such as NO with in vivo monitoring of pre-symptomatic risk factors such as microbubble formation could reduce the risk of adverse events such as DCS, but requires novel algorithms for dynamic control of pressure-related physiologic conditions, constant physiological feedback, and precise gas administration. This solicitation calls for novel gas mixtures, models and algorithms that extend operational capabilities while minimizing the risk of the following: • DCS—gas expansion injuries and bubble formation in blood and tissue caused by rapid ascent; • oxygen toxicity—increased partial pressure of oxygen (PO2 > 1.6 ATA) resulting in seizures; • gas narcosis—euphoria and decrement in intellectual and psychomotor performance related to the lipid solubility of the gas; and • hypoxia—decrement in cognition and performance related to low partial pressure of oxygen. The dynamic sensing and control could include but is not limited to such gases as O2, COx, NOx, H2S, and inert gas diluent. Additionally, this solicitation seeks to develop novel component technologies including but not limited to: chip-scale gas chromatograph / mass spectrometer (to actively and rapidly monitor inspired and expired gases/agents); capacitive micro-machined ultrasonic transducer arrays (for in vivo bubble detection and environmental monitoring); and gas/vapor control elements such as MEMS gas pumps, valves and nebulizers that could be integrated into a physiologic control system for extreme environments. Such new component technologies may also support next generation military open circuit, semi-closed circuit or close circuit rebreather systems. The platform should enable safe operation in this representative extreme combat dive profile: (1) insertion via military free fall from 35,000 feet flight level; (2) a brief surface interval; (3) combat dive down to 200 feet sea water (FSW) for at least 120 minutes duration, surface and immediately begin a second dive of variable, increasing depth with minima at 100 FSW (for at least 10 minutes), 150 FSW (for at least 10 minutes), and 200 FSW (for at least 20 minutes) without decompression obligation; (4) brief surface interval; and (5) extraction in an unpressurized aircraft below 14,000 feet mean sea level.",595,4002,1,No,No,No,,"Define the gas mixtures suitable for the representative dive profile.

Demonstrate ability to spatio-temporally control electrical function for therapeutic applications such as surgical site infection (SSI) mitigation and nerve stimulation for chronic pain relief.","Electronically active biomedical systems that can harmlessly and controllably resorb into the body open new avenues to therapeutic applications that are currently unfeasible. Those of specific interest to DARPA and the DoD include continuous in vivo monitoring with external, wireless power and receivers (e.g. for prosthetic fit or bone fractures), appliques that combat broad-spectrum surgical site infections (SSI) without antibiotics (e.g. for wound healing or medical implants), electrical stimulation-based modalities to combat chronic pain without opioids, or electrical simulation for regenerative applications. Furthermore, in limited resource areas such as DoD deployment locations, remote or impoverished geographic areas, or emergency response locations where clinical care is limited, biodegradable biomedical devices would enable remote patient monitoring, compliance, and treatment and would negate the need for device extraction. However, these applications are currently untenable because the materials space fails to resolve key technical challenges to implementation. Current approaches to biodegradable, biocompatible sensor/actuator systems for medical therapeutics and monitoring provide limited utility and poor performance for two key technological reasons: 1. Demonstrations that utilize biodegradable organic/polymer-based active regions to produce the electrical function, lack the electronic performance (e.g. carrier mobility, µ, typically ~0.1-1 cm2/V-s) to be of significant utility beyond low power transistors; 2. Other examples segregate the biodegradable function to the non-electronically active components while leaving behind non-degradable elements (where biocompatibility is an issue) that require future extraction. The extraction costs related to patient care, morbidity, and mortality, and additional risks associated with surgical site infections and antibiotic-resistant strains (and their combined danger) make additional device extraction undesirable; however allowing the device to persist inflicts unnecessary burden on the patient and potential future complications. Potential avenues to successful development of the aforementioned applications all require the identification, development, and optimization of electronic materials with performance amenable to simple low power systems with onboard processing (e.g. semiconductor active regions with electron mobility, µn, ~102 cm2/V-s). Critically, all materials under development must be biocompatible and bioresorbable. Devices developed under this SBIR must demonstrate stable functionality over medically-relevant timescales (e.g. 15 days for an SSI treatment applique) and controllable bioresorption over medically-appropriate timescales (e.g. hours to weeks, depending on the material constituents). Devices developed must operate with electronic performance applicable to the purported treatment (e.g. blood pH monitoring with data transfer to external receiver at 10 minute intervals). This topic is focused on the development of a class of biodegradable materials capable of electronic functionality comparable to traditional electronics used in low power, low cost systems. The biocompatible materials used in these systems should be optimized for functionality, performance, and tunable bioresorption timescales. Proposers should develop the materials, device designs, and manufacturing approaches. Mechanisms for power and data extraction should be described, as well as a plan for developing a fabrication process compatible with the good manufacturing practice (GMP) platform.

The deliverable will be a paper study with detailed material and device analysis, together with experiments to illustrate high performance capabilities (i.e. comparable to SOI-based systems) in the key components. Mechanisms for power and data extraction should be described. Additionally, the study should include an overview and analysis of a strategy for scalable and industry-compatible fabrication processes for device production.

Demonstrate stable functionality over medically-relevant timescales (e.g. 15 days for an SSI treatment applique) and controllable bioresorption over medically-safe timescales (e.g. days to months, depending on the application). Devices developed must demonstrate electronic performance applicable to the purported treatment, along with mechanisms for onboard power, processing, and data transmission. Assess the properties of the electronics and the actuators, with quantitative comparison to computational models. Deliverables of a prototype device and valid test data appropriate for a commercial production path are expected, as well as a demonstration of functionality in vitro.

Potential transition customers include Military Health System – Defense Medical Research and Development Program (MHS DMRDP), United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR), Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine (AFIRM), Military Infectious Diseases Research Program (MIDRP), and Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The technology to be developed is applicable to biomedical devices and active scaffolds for therapeutic treatment applications as well as monitoring, diagnosis and performance measurements. There is a significant commercial market for biodegradable, medical devices and active scaffolds, particularly those currently involved in the development of technologies capable of enhancing and monitoring wound and bone fracture healing, pain relief without opioids, drug delivery, performance monitoring, and the continuous monitoring of glucose and other metabolites.

Spectrum efficiency is measured as bits/s/hz or alternatively as bits/s/hz/sqKm for all nodes of a network. This effort seeks to find economical and practical means to increase efficiency metrics by significant factors relative to current SISO QPSK rate ½ TDMA system examples. Particular attention should be paid to innovative methods to use the same spectrum with other heterogeneous legacy systems while minimizing cross network interference. Many new technologies have been proposed at every layer of communication network protocol that can have important impact on spectrum efficiency. • Proposed techniques at the physical layer include MIMO, Collaborative MIMO, MUD, Polarimetrics, DSA, OSA, Smart Antennas, Interference Alignment and overlay/underlay [1-8]. Header compression, adaptive scheduling, adaptive FEC, adaptive power control, and prioritized queuing are common additional efficiency considerations [9-10]. • Techniques have also been proposed to enhance efficiency of modulation, MAC, Link, network and application layers. • Awareness techniques such as local capacity analysis have been proposed enabling optimization for current spectrum activity and network traffic requirements. • Database structures and other tools have also been proposed as supporting infrastructure to enhance spectrum efficiency, including: trunking, pooling, and radio environment maps. In addition, circuit techniques have been proposed to enhance linearity and dynamic range to enable previously impractical methods for simultaneous transmission and reception (STAR) [11]. The focus of this SBIR topic is to create novel techniques and combinations of techniques leading to significantly higher systems levels of spectrum efficiency than current defense communication systems are able to achieve. Design adaptively should locally optimize current spectrum activity and traffic load conditions. It is desirable that system designs consider cost effectiveness, network performance, and practical deployment for various platforms. Deployment platforms of interest range in scale, power and performance over the range of ships, aircraft, vehicles, robots, soldiers, and sensors.

Electric field signatures are from electrical power generators and power distribution systems. Gravity signatures are from the presence or absence of mass (in the case of an underground tunnel or facility). Current electric field and gravity field measurement methods require close-access sensor emplacement or low-flying airborne platforms. These are operationally unsuitable because of their difficult access requirements and low coverage rates. The goal of this effort is to replace those traditional point sensing technologies – requiring sampling near a facility and providing limited spatial extent – with remote sensing methods that decouple the sensor hardware from the measurement point and enable operationally attractive stand-offs and fast search rates. Such a system would operate from an aerial system, be able to scan from a distance of 10 kilometers, and have sufficient sensitivity to detect the operation of generator, the operational status of a power line (on/off), and the presence of an underground facility. DARPA is not interested in improved point sensors where the field measurement point and the sensor hardware are at the same location, tomographic based solutions whereby a remote field is calculated from an array of local point measurements, or clutter rejection techniques to improve local measurements of remote fields. Science and technologies may exist to achieve this goal. The commercial Electrical Single Particle Aerodynamic Relaxation Time (E-SPART) analyzer measures the secondary effect of a particle deflection in an AC electric field to determine the particle size and charge.

The usefulness of picosats may be dramatically increased if they are able to coordinate with each other and participate in a System F6 satellite cluster. Such coordination would enable resources such as communication, computation, and navigation to be shared, minimizing the component complexity of any single spacecraft. Further, given the availability of an existing cluster, the marginal cost and complexity of space missions that traditionally require a conventional spacecraft (e.g., imager payloads) can be reduced to a level that is readily accommodated by a picosat. DARPA’s System F6 program plans to launch an on-orbit testbed in 2015 to demonstrate the key enabling technologies of fractionation. The program will provide the enabling standards, software, and four satellite platforms to host shared resources that may be leveraged by additional space missions. These resources include 1) a 24/7 persistent communication link between the cluster and any Internet-connected node on the ground, 2) a high-speed space-to-ground downlink, 3) a high-speed computing element, and 4) high-capacity memory storage devices. The intent of this SBIR is development of innovative picosats capable of hosting an Earth-imaging payload and leveraging the F6 demonstration cluster and architecture to command, manage, package, and deliver Earth imagery data to the ground. The picosat should be capable of communicating with the demonstration cluster and participating in cluster flight navigation. All standards and software necessary to interface with the on-orbit cluster will be provided by DARPA. This includes the Layer 1 and 2 standards and software for inter-module communications (either 802.11g or Ka-Band TDMA), an application development kit needed to develop the picosat mission payload application that is executed on the cluster, and the cluster flight behaviors, algorithms, and reference implementation software. (The picosat platform should be capable of exchanging cluster flight navigation data, but is not required to participate in station-keeping and scatter/re-gather maneuvers). The picosat should maximize mission utility while minimizing size, weight, and power requirements by substituting components, subsystems, and functions traditionally needed to support a spacecraft mission payload (e.g., command and data handling, attitude control, telemetry). These capabilities should be delivered by leveraging resources in the cluster and managed through a mission payload application on the cluster. The picosat should deliver at least one image of the Earth with recognizable features (e.g., coastlines) within the expected 6-month duration of the mission. No ground station support will be provided – solutions should utilize the space-to-ground links and computational resources to process and deliver the image to a specified Internet-connected computing node on the ground.

Hardware payloads, even reprogrammable solutions, tend to limit the utility of the space vehicle and require increased algorithm development effort, since hardware-related programming is required in order to benefit from the available processing speed. New mission demands and changes in spacecraft bus and sensor technologies drive up space acquisition costs and lengthen space system acquisition times. Virtualized payloads have the potential to increase the beneficial mission utility and life of space platforms while decreasing acquisition time and cost. In addition, a space qualified hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) has the potential to reduce the cost-to-entry barrier to space thereby expanding the space industrial base while providing an environment for commercially developed plug-and-play applications. The goal is to develop a space qualified hypervisor which will support the virtualization of satellite payloads.

Also, commercial versions of the hypervisor could be produced for civilian and scientific applications. Commercial satellite manufacturers could incorporate them into a variety of commercial satellite systems for sale to various interested customers. Commercial companies could also provide competitively priced space hypervisor hosted applications, communications or remote sensing services to paying customers, including the national security community. The contractor shall finalize technology development of the proposed space hypervisor and begin commercialization of the product. In addition to military communications or intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions, commercial civilian applications for a space qualified hypervisor could include space-based satellite communications. Phase III should solidly validate the notion of a space qualified hypervisor with a low level of technological risk. The goal for full commercialization should ideally be Technology Readiness Level 9, with the actual system proven through successful mission operations. Specifically, Phase III should ultimately produce a hypervisor suitable for hosting space system payloads. The contractor must also consider manufacturing processes in accordance with the President’s Executive Order on “Encouraging Innovation in Manufacturing” to insure that the innovations developed under this SBIR can be readily manufactured and packaged for transportation and deployment. During Phase III, this capability could conceivably transition or expand to the appropriate division of Air Force Space Command upon full rate production and deployment.",1,"on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology, July 19-23.

Measurements of these two forms will be conducted in an in vivo system to determine their variance under experimental conditions known to affect oxytocin levels.","Oxytocin is a hormone widely known for its role in reproduction and childbirth. More recently its role as a neuromodulator has been highlighted, particularly in facilitating pair bonding, maternal interactions, and trust behaviors (1,2). An explosion of research on the effects of oxytocin has ensued, and the hormone is listed in 213 ongoing or completed clinical trials on clinicaltrials.gov. Oxytocin also affects behaviors relevant to national security. Oxytocin can impact behaviors ranging from whether two individuals trust each other, how someone reacts to stress, and even wound healing. Therefore, developing oxytocin assays with improved sensitivity and specificity will provide the necessary tools to understand the function of this important neurohormone (3,4). These tools can be used across DoD research programs in areas such as stress resilience, human decision making, and PTSD treatment to enable advances in technology development relevant to the warfighter. Unfortunately, from an experimental perspective, oxytocin is present at low levels in the body. Basal blood levels of oxytocin are in the pg/mL range (2). This low biological level makes accurate measurements of oxytocin difficult. In the laboratory, oxytocin is often measured by immune-assays, which involve the binding of anti-bodies to the molecule of interest (5). These molecular methods have improved somewhat to include extraction steps that concentrate the oxytocin samples. However, sensitivity is still an issue. While detection is usually possible in the blood, measuring oxytocin from other more readily available samples (i.e. saliva or sweat) is often not possible because the levels are undetectable. Innovative assay methods that significantly improve oxytocin assay sensitivity, particularly enabling measurement in these less traditional samples would be a breakthrough to this research field. Recent studies have shown the regulation of oxytocin to be a complex process. In particular two forms of oxytocin have been identified. A 10-12-amino acid pro-hormone is first produced, and then, at some point, may be cleaved to a 9-amino acid hormone. This shortened form is the active neuropeptide, oxytocin, known to bind to the oxytocin receptor and credited with oxytocin’s behavior altering effects. The biological role, if any of the 12-amino acid pro-hormone is unknown, but has been associated with atypical social behaviors in autism and possibly related to obesity in Prader-Willi syndrome (6,7). Additional forms of different lengths or biologically active metabolites of oxytocin may exist, as well. Current assay techniques are non-specific to these different forms of oxytocin, failing to differentiate bioactive from potentially inert forms. This lack of specificity may add significant noise to a measurement of very low hormone levels (5). New detection techniques that distinguish between these different forms of oxytocin may elucidate a functional role for this complex biological regulation. This technique could help explain seemingly paradoxical findings in the oxytocin literature, regarding its role both in pro-social and pro-stress behaviors. Regardless, more sensitive and specific assay techniques for oxytocin would provide a more accurate picture of the complex regulation of this intriguing neurohormone. Clinical researchers and practitioners would also benefit from such a tool, to aid in understanding oxytocin’s role in social disorders, such as autism, and potential therapeutic application, as demonstrated by its high use in clinical trials. Particularly, the ability to measure different forms of oxytocin, presently impossible, could demonstrate a highly specific biomarker of social and/or stress disorders, or at least altered responses to social and stressful stimuli.",552,3805,1,No,No,No,,"Determine the technical feasibility of the proposed measurement technique for oxytocin. Performers will identify an innovative technical approach for the sensitive detection of oxytocin and its derivatives. If possible, performers will conduct proof-of-principle studies to demonstrate that different forms of oxytocin can be reliably detected, using synthetic oxytocin. Phase I deliverables will include a technical report on the proposed technique and an experimental outline for studies necessary to improve assay sensitivity and determine oxytocin species’ levels in an in vivo system.","Develop and refine the technique identified in Phase I, particularly to increase its sensitivity. In addition, the technique should be used to measure biological oxytocin collected from in vivo animal or human experiments to determine how levels of the long and short forms of oxytocin vary under conditions of stress and social interaction, which have previously shown oxytocin sensitivity. Sensitivity of the new system should be benchmarked against existing detection methods and measurements from in vivo systems compared to detection of known levels of synthetic oxytocin. Required phase II deliverables will include a technical a report detailing the new measurement technique and its results from the above-mentioned comparisons. Findings related to differences in short and long forms of oxytocin under varying experimental conditions (e.g. stress or social interaction) should also be included.","Military research laboratories would be very interested in using a highly sensitive and specific oxytocin assay. For example, the Air Force Research Laboratory have been measuring oxytocin with traditional enzyme immunoassay methods for defense applications. An improved assay technique could be used to reanalyze their samples and may shed new light on the problem of developing trust. Other military partners may be interested in this technology or a future derivative for the measurement of oxytocin to understand influence. The DARPA program Narrative Networks is examining oxytocin in this context and would benefit from increased measurement specificity and sensitivity. Developments made under this SBIR effort could be transitioned, in synergy with findings from Narrative Networks, to provide better assays of oxytocin as it changes with narrative influence. The clinical dimensions of oxytocin measurement may also present transition opportunities to the military, since oxytocin has been linked with stress reactions. New measurement techniques will allow clinical scientists to investigate if it plays a role or is correlated with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (8). A highly sensitive and specific assay to measure oxytocin in biological samples, including blood, saliva, and sweat would have a number of commercial applications. Biotechnology companies would be interested in refining an improved technique and would likely see additional investment in development and production as a small risk, given the research and commercial need for such an assay.",1,"Olff, M.

Methods and tools, applicable over a broad range of bandwidth of streaming data -- kbps up to beyond 100 gbps -- will leverage established principles of statistical analysis, visualization, and cognitive science.","Streaming data are not stored either due to cost of storage at very high data rates or they are stored with delayed processing that is of lesser operational value. Increasing data generation and collection make a streaming data model inevitable for some streams -- the question becomes more about the data-rate of the stream and the class of computational operations that are applicable. Current techniques for streaming data analysis use ad-hoc sampling and data decimation techniques, leaving the overwhelming bulk of the collected data unexamined and its value lost. Tasks of streaming data analysis include trend analysis, event detection, and discovery of underlying structures. Human cognitive abilities and the visual system are ideally suited to do these tasks. Data visualization techniques leverage the human visual system to organize and structure data using visual primitives (e.g. shape, color, intensity, size, position, etc.) to encode massive amounts of data and reveal relationships, anomalies, correlations, and associated uncertainties. However, current data visualization techniques, like much current analytical processes, rely on post-processing of stored data. Therefore, a new approach is required that enables analysis of data as it passes through system memory by converting the data stream, based on its rate/bandwidth, into appropriate visual elements that encode and characterize salient features of the data with real-time visualization processing. That is, the visualization process needs to be resident with the data as it passes through the system, and must be systematically driven by statistical characteristics of the data stream. The visual elements generated in this way should incrementally capture base statistics (e.g., counts, distributions, frequency, etc.) and higher order statistical measures (e.g., autocorrelation functions, probability distribution, time and frequency domain measures, etc.) and, when combined, provide insight into underlying structure, relationships, and trends in the data stream. The design of the visual elements should take into account cognitive abilities and biases in segmentation, grouping (e.g. gestalt measures), chunking, and user expertise and training. Additionally, the visual elements should capture sufficient statistics and structure, so that reconstruction of the data stream is possible to some level of precision. The real-time visualization tools need to be able to be tuned to the available processing resources and data throughput while maintaining analytical utility. The goal of this research topic is the application of established statistical and cognitive principles in the demonstration and development of a real-time system that can generate data visualizations that capture the structures and relationships in data streams (from kbps to and beyond 100 gbps streams, where methods may either be uniform or differ across this bandwidth spectrum). Visual primitives that leverage human visual processing will need to be defined based on cognitive principles of streaming information. Algorithmic, statistical, or rule-based definition of the combination of visual and analytical primitives is desirable. The system should be modifiable on-the-fly by human operators to handle new salient features or to highlight discovered correlations. Streaming data may be open source, purchased, or synthetically generated. The techniques should be broadly applicable. PHASE I: • Task 1: Develop an approach for incrementally encoding statistical measures in visual elements. The visual elements should be able to be combined into complex visualizations that leverage human cognitive abilities for pattern recognition and correlation. In-situ visualization run-time code should be tunable to differences in system configurations (single vs. multi-core) and data bandwidth. • Task 2: Develop an approach for the application and combination of the visual elements (from task 1). • Task 3: Develop an architecture and conceptual design for the implementation of a dynamic system based on the elements and principles developed in tasks 1 and 2. • Task 4: Implement a minimal proof-of-concept real-time system that processes some set of representative data and generates visualizations constructed from visual elements from tasks 1-2. Phase I deliverables should include a Final Phase I report that includes: (1) a detailed description of the approach (or algorithm) for applying statistical and cognitive principles to a specific data set; (2) a detailed system architecture and design; (3) code and a demonstration of the approach using the proof-of-concept system.",671,4646,1,No,No,No,,,"Develop, demonstrate, and validate a proof of concept design of the real-time visualization generation tool.

It is anticipated that the final product will handle multiple data types such as structured and unstructured data, imagery, and video with different characteristics such as noise and reliability acquired through sensors.

Historically, optical signaling began to uproot wired electronic communications with long trunk telecommunications lines. As the technology and manufacturing processes improved and reduced costs, the minimum link for which optics was superior became shorter every year. Today it is clear that high data-rate optical links can outperform their wired counterparts for links greater than a few centimeters. It is the short range electrical interconnect, however, that is principal source of energy dissipation in modern computing systems. In integrated circuits, performance and power efficiency improve with reducing the size of the system through scaling. For instance, the capacitance per unit length of an interconnect element tends to remain constant through geometric scaling. Because the loss of the line will scale as capacitance, the size reduction of the components and interconnects will reduce the total length and therefore the total power consumption. This reduction in communication costs was one of the original motivations for circuit integration. Miniaturization, however, cannot continue indefinitely. Although physical limitations such as ohmic resistance due to grain boundary scattering will increase with scaling, the principal limitation is due to the total number of lines enabled by continued scaling. To give a simple picture, if we are able to double the number of transistors on a chip without increasing its size, we have approximately doubled the thermal dissipation due to interconnects. Although electrostatic signaling is efficient for low-bandwidth and short distance communications, the loss in interconnects will be a key limiter in future computing systems. The huge information carrying capacity of optical fiber networks is a result of the high frequency of an optical electromagnetic wave. Optical interconnects can have low loss and large bandwidth, however optical interconnect dimensions are typically orders of magnitude larger than electrical lines, in general limited by diffraction effects to sizes on the order of the wavelength of light (~(mu)m). Therefore, they have been unsuitable to integrate with electronic devices at the chip level and consume waveguide pitches much larger than metal wires. That said, recent research in nanophotonics has identified techniques to confine optical fields to deeply sub-wavelength scales.[1-4] This project seeks the demonstration of optical waveguides with low-loss and high density as required for future interconnects. In addition to mitigating loss for high density interconnects, successful demonstration of highly confined fields will also provide several ancillary benefits for active devices. The limiting parameters of optical modulators, such as their bandwidth and driving voltage, can be significantly improved if implemented with highly confined optical fields. Other active devices, such as optical switches, can likewise be optimized. Successful development of optical interconnects will result in advanced electronic components for DoD systems with higher data throughput at lower power dissipation levels. These components will advance embedded computing applications at various sensor platforms requiring very data-intensive computations with severe power efficiency requirements.

Another key transition opportunity for the Department of Defense is in integrated, low-Vpi modulators for analog and digital photonic links. Dual Use Applications: A nanoscale photonic interconnect architecture promises to alleviate the problems associated with the interconnect bottleneck for high clock-speed computing, improving both power efficiency and performance. Applications for this technology span both the military and commercial arenas from terabit signal processors to multi-terabit per second routers. Apparent applications include data intensive computational platforms where the processing unit executes intensive I/O operations or requires considerable data transfers between different areas on the chip. Commercial Application: In the commercial space, applications range from ultra-fast on-board and off- board signal routing as well as efficient high-performance signal processors.

In particular, the military is deploying wireless systems much more broadly and to lower echelons, which significantly complicates the process for distributing cryptographic key information. Creating a secret among authorized radios in order to encrypt or authenticate traffic is paramount to protecting personnel and missions. A scalable technical approach is needed to meet the evolving needs of military wireless communications. This technology is directly applicable to future systems developed at the Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC, formerly the Joint Program Executive Office of the Joint Tactical Radio System, JPEO JTRS). Wireless networks suffer from variations in received signal levels and delays due to motion of the transmitter or the receiver, as well as objects in the vicinity of either. One fundamental characteristic of radio wave propagation is that the delays and fades are the same (i.e. reciprocal) in both directions. In other words, the channel experience from radio 1 to radio 2 is the same as that experienced from 2 to 1. However, the radio frequency (RF) components and other electronics internal to the radios typically do not possess this reciprocity property. Consequently, wireless system designs typically assume no benefit from the reciprocity of the radio propagation. There is much to be gained if the system can take advantage of this property, both in terms of performance and potentially in security. System performance can be improved by lowering control overhead and enabling faster reaction times to time-varying fading because a radio can adapt its transmissions based on its own measurements of the channel rather than waiting for feedback from its intended receiver. The benefit can be even more pronounced in multi-antenna systems[1]. Security can be improved by leveraging the variations in the reciprocal channel as a secret shared (i.e. a key) among the two communicating radios in order to authenticate or encrypt transmissions between the two. Because the channel is dependent on the position of each of the radios, a third radio that is not collocated with either of the original two will not experience the same propagation fades and therefore will not be able to determine the secret key. A variety of work, both theoretical and experimental, has been performed on this topic, but a consistent set of analysis and experimentation has yet to lead to a recommended system approach. Clearly, the accuracy with which the devices can be calibrated determines the correlation of the channel estimate to the actual reciprocal channel. Most existing work focuses on the use of channel state information for a particular measurable statistic. For this effort, proposed solutions should assess the trade-off between accurate device calibration and the relevant performance metric. Proposed solutions should quantify the secrecy rate of a pair of radios exploiting channel reciprocity relative to a potential eavesdropper, as well as suggest approaches to share such a secret among several radios, including potential vulnerabilities of such approaches. In addition, the research should address the system impacts of maintaining calibration of the devices to produce a particular agreement in channel estimates. Analysis should be supported by experiments with actual radios, where the radios can be calibrated to varying degrees of fidelity. Agreement in channel estimates at participating radios should be quantified. The research should demonstrate the ability to generate a shared secret among desired radios, as well as to utilize the channel estimate to improve system efficiency.",576,3788,1,No,No,No,,Propose a relevant channel model that incorporates time-varying fading and a model of RF component responses.

As mobile systems become more widely deployed, more distributed key generation approaches will become necessary. In addition, information exchange requirements are increasing as access to radio spectrum is decreasing. The results of this research effort can enable scalability and efficiency of future military communications systems, and may potentially lead to an appliqué that can enhance existing systems in the near-term. Leveraging channel reciprocity has great potential benefits in commercial applications, both for licensed commercial cellular systems and for unlicensed wireless access points. The ever-growing demand for wireless services, particularly for mobile devices, is driving technology to be more spectrally efficient as well as adaptive to changing channel conditions. Moreover, the commercial world tends to lag the defense community in system security and the increased use of wireless devices for sensitive applications such as banking and medical monitoring has caused a gap between the security needs and capabilities of commercially available wireless systems. The solutions proposed as part of this effort can partially bridge that gap.",1,"Wilson, R., D. Tse, and R. A.

Lighter, smaller, more reliable actuation technology can help enable game-changing new aircraft capabilities. Electromechanical actuation offers great potential advantages in improved maintainability, ease of distribution, actuator packaging and installation, system-level power-to-weight ratios, stiffness, installation flexibility, and application-customized designs [Ref 1]. These theoretical advantages over hydraulic and pneumatic systems have been recognized for at least forty years [Ref 2]. At the same time, hydraulic actuation dominates critical applications in aerospace today, particularly for the movement of aircraft primary flight control surfaces. New aircraft, including the Lockheed Martin F-35, Boeing 787, and Airbus A380, still use hydraulics in primary flight control applications. Airworthiness standards for large aircraft expect system design to drive to a very low probability of catastrophic failure. As an example, the Federal Aviation Administration’s advisory circular AC25-1309 mandates system design with a probability of catastrophic failure of less than one in ten to the ninth operating hours [Ref 3]. Conventionally, hydraulic actuation achieves the requisite reliability at a system level by use of multiple independent hydraulic circuits driving a single control surface with very low probability of failure of the final hydraulic actuator output link or links. By contrast, existing electromechanical actuators typically employ a rotary-to-rotary or rotary-to-linear output elements that depend on mechanical rolling element bearings, which, in serial arrangement, do not achieve the requisite reliability ratios. Single-point failures that can lead to a mechanical jam are generally not certifiable in a primary control application. While parallel devices or complex arrangements may mitigate these failures, system complexity, cost, and weight are increased to the point that hydraulics are generally favored [Ref 1]. Alternate electromechanical actuator designs and arrangements are needed that can achieve failure rates less than one incidence per ten to the ninth hours, to enable their use in flight critical applications as well as in critical space applications. Novel approaches to electromechanical actuator design are sought, which robustly and comprehensively consider component reliability levels, and apply creative architectural solutions to achieve fault tolerance and high reliability. Fault tolerance is judged at a system level by a rigorous fault hazards analysis (FHA) and fault-tree buildup. An exemplary buildup for a state-of-the-art fault-tolerant mechanical actuator design is provided in Ref 4. Note that this dual-lane fault-tolerant electric drive architecture is still only capable of achieving a probability of system failure of 8.68 × 10^-6 failures per hour, far short of the 1× 10^-9 failures per hour goal for unaided primary flight control. The limiting factors are identified to be the mechanical elements – gearbox and actuator mechanism. From a system perspective, simply creating more reliable mechanical components will not achieve the requisite failure rate goals; a novel electromechanical system architecture is required. Electromechanical design approaches should be widely scalable but readily demonstrable at a small scale in a laboratory bench setting. If component performances are more than an order of magnitude greater of those found in standard catalogues of electronic or non-electronic component reliability, a full justification must be provided. Rigorous consideration should be given to the complexity and reliability of any required sensing, fault-detection, and toggling equipment incorporated in a design. Preferred design approaches are those readily scaled across different actuator sizes and across different aircraft applications. Approaches are preferred that could be scaled to encompass a family of actuators that could eliminate the hydraulic flight control actuation systems of a large, man-rated aircraft. Design concepts should also identify electrical bus requirements, including preferred numbers of electrical circuits, efficiency, and thermal considerations, whether the actuator will put electric power back on the bus, and if it will need to be conditioned. Designs are desired that will accommodate power-reconditioning and regeneration from actuator back-driving, to lower the overall heat rejection requirements. Additionally, thorough consideration of integration into an aircraft electrical bus is encouraged. In particular, minimizing peak power usage and power regenerated by the actuation system is considered important in order to reduce the load on the aircraft's electrical system. Preferred actuator designs should be operable on 270 VDC or +/- 270 VDC buses, although lower DC bus voltages are considered acceptable for bench tests. Actuators are desired that provide at least 3hp of peak power, although lower powers are considered acceptable for intermediate testing activity. Larger designs are preferred, especially actuator architectures that are modular or can be easily scaled across different applications requiring higher stroke, higher frequency response, higher output force, or frequent control reversal. High stiffness designs are preferred. The scaling limitations of any architectural approach must be clearly identified.",777,5609,1,No,No,No,,"Design a concept for a fault-tolerant, ultra-high reliability electromechanical actuator.

Unmanned aircraft programs, including demonstration programs executed by DARPA, may have particular benefit from such actuators, as the inclusion of hydraulic systems adds great expense, complexity, and weight to an aircraft. The military transition path would be inclusion of an actuator into a future aircraft program of a record. Aerospace-grade electromechanical actuators can also find application in the commercial aerospace industry. It is an oft-stated goal to move towards more-electric aircraft, however electromechanical actuators have largely been relegated to non- flight-critical applications. A commercial transition path would be development of a flight-grade actuator and inclusion into a future aircraft program of record. As an example, Airbus explicitly states that a move towards electric actuation is in their long-term goals, as they desire to reduce conversion losses and increase overall systems efficiency [Ref 5].",1,"All-Electric Aircraft, Clean Sky Initiative FAA Advisory Circular, AC 25.1309-1A - System Design and Analysis; J.W.

For example, advanced optical communications applications, including single-photon quantum communications and quantum information processing for provably secure data links, can benefit from operation in both the visible/near- IR wavelengths (400–800 nm) and the telecommunications C-band (1530–1565 nm). Visible and near-IR wavelengths enable coupling to atomic systems / quantum dots (e.g., for quantum memory) and detection via fast, high-efficiency, room-temperature single-photon detectors; but, unfortunately, visible/near-IR photons cannot be transmitted over long distances through single-mode fiber. C-band photons can be transmitted over long distances with extremely low loss using the existing single-mode fiber telecommunications grid, but can be neither coupled to atomic systems nor easily detected. In principle, QFC provides the ideal solution: coherent transfer between visible photons (for photon processing, storage, and detection) and telecommunications photons (for long-haul transmission through fiber). Perfecting this technology could bridge the distance gap that limits the state-of-the-art in provably secure communications, thus opening the door for a revolutionary capability for the DoD. Thus far, QFC has been demonstrated in various nonlinear optical media, such as crystals, waveguides, microresonators, and optical fibers. In such systems, quasi-phase matching (QPM) has been an enabling technology to allow efficient nonlinear interactions to be designed over a large wavelength span. In nonlinear crystals or waveguides, QPM is usually achieved via periodic poling, whereas in nonlinear microresonators, it can be realized utilizing the modal dispersion of the cavity modes. While some applications of QPM have become commercialized, others are emerging that place more stringent requirements on device fabrication and processing. For example, QFC may prove to be important for a host of quantum information processing applications [1]. For some such applications it would be advantageous to obtain a narrow phase matching peak, enabling a potential direct interface to quantum memory, for example. On the other hand, a broad phase matching bandwidth is useful when up-converting a high-rate single-photon channel since it allows the channel to be time-multiplexed to multiple detectors by exploiting multi-wavelength pumps [2]. In addition to reaching higher speed performance, such a system allows high efficiency Si avalanche photodiode (APD) single-photon counters to be used at a wider variety of wavelengths, including the telecom bands where single-photon counters tend to have poor efficiency, limiting the reach of quantum communications. Optical up- conversion with a tunable laser followed by Si APDs can also be used to build an extremely sensitive spectrometer [3]. In such a case a narrow band single phase matching peak is highly desirable because a narrow band leads to higher resolution while a single peak reduces unwanted cross talk. Quantum applications are in general highly sensitive to very small (i.e., single photon) light leakage levels from scattering processes such as Raman scattering [4]. Moreover, quantum systems are particularly sensitive to loss but most waveguide based frequency converters have significant (> 3dB) loss especially when coupled to standard optical fibers. In addition to quantum applications, classical applications in instrumentation are also emerging such as measuring the jitter of attosecond optical pulses [5]. Such applications can benefit from waveguides that support dual polarizations and Type-II nonlinear interactions. Type-II phase matching can also be employed for pre- screening waveguides prior to poling to improve yield and uniformity [6]. These emerging applications demand a new generation of nonlinear waveguides with different and more stringent performance metrics. Thus it is of great practical importance that these new waveguides can be made with high yield, so the cost is not a limiting factor. Innovative solutions are sought to the problem of robust quantum frequency conversion. Successful solutions should simultaneously address all of the following critical technological challenges. (1) Low loss. Nonlinear waveguides are limited by coupling loss (from single-mode fiber for the C-Band signal, to single-mode fiber or free space for the visible signal), insertion loss (to and from the waveguide itself) and transmission loss (per unit length) through the frequency conversion medium; the net loss from all sources limits device performance and it is this net loss that should be compared to program milestones. (2) Ability to tailor the phase-matching bandwidths as detailed above. (3) Wavelength selectability. A completely successful solution should provide the flexibility to couple any wavelength in the visible/near-IR to any wavelength in the C-band. Note that this flexibility need not be in real time, but should instead reflect a flexibility in the fabrication process that allows any one device to be tailored for any two specific wavelengths. For high-energy photons near 400-nm, multiple stage frequency conversion may be required. (4) Efficiency. The waveguide nonlinearity should be sufficiently strong to provide near 100%-efficient coherent (entanglement-preserving) frequency conversion. (5) Robustness and portability. The ultimate goal of this SBIR is to develop a packaged, robust, portable, room-temperature technology that can be inserted into an existing system.",818,5748,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a detailed computer model for the performance of a quantum frequency conversion technology which fulfills all of the above requirements.

PHASE II: Construct prototype devices whose end-to-end performance effectively demonstrates the contractor's technical approach. Using these devices, test all PHASE I predictions for device performance. In particular, singly peaked phase matching bandwidths of <0.2 nm must be demonstrated. Losses and scattering effects must be minimized making the devices suitable for quantum applications, possibly those in a cascaded environment. Low end-to-end losses (<1.5 dB) through the nonlinear material must be demonstrated. Methods to maintain acceptable yields must also be developed. After characterizing the prototype devices, further refine and extend the PHASE I models. Finalize a design for a production system capable of delivering tailored devices as final products, and use the refined models to predict the performance of the second-generation (PHASE III) devices.

DARPA is currently funding a major effort to create macroscopic quantum communications systems capable of combining quantum security with classical telecommunications speeds and distances (The QUINESS Program). Deployment of this technology will require exactly the type of robust frequency conversion devices described in this SBIR. More broadly, any sensing or communications system which requires detection of ultra-low levels of telecommunications-band radiation will benefit from a frequency conversion technology that enables use of superior visible-light single-photon detectors. The new breed of nonlinear frequency conversion is foreseen to be used in a variety applications including single photon detection for quantum information or lidar, and classical measurements such as low photon spectroscopy or highly accurate laser pulse jitter measurements.",1,"""Type II Sum Frequency Generation in KTP Waveguides: a Technique for Pre and Post Screening,"" C.

Current trends in social media and commerce, with voluntary disclosure of personal information, create other potential vulnerabilities for individuals participating heavily in the digital world. The Netflix Challenge in 2009 was launched with the goal of creating better customer pick prediction algorithms for the movie service [1]. An unintended consequence of the Netflix Challenge was the discovery that it was possible to de-anonymize the entire contest data set with very little additional data. This de-anonymization led to a federal lawsuit and the cancellation of the sequel challenge [2]. The purpose of this topic is to understand the national level vulnerabilities that may be exploited through the use of public data available in the open or for purchase. Could a modestly funded group deliver nation-state type effects using only public data? The threat of active data spills and breaches of corporate and government information systems are being addressed by many private, commercial, and government organizations. The purpose of this research is to investigate data sources that are readily available for any individual to purchase, mine, and exploit. The marketing community uses large-scale data aggregators, big data analytics, and social science techniques to deliver highly targeted advertising campaigns. Does the availability of data for purchase or for free, advanced marketing techniques (e.g., collaborative filtering, computational advertising), and low-cost big data analytic capabilities (e.g., Amazon EC2) provide a determined adversary with the tools necessary to inflict nation-state level damage? To what extent could a non-state actor collect, process, and analyze a portfolio of purchased and open source data to reconstruct an organizational profile, fiscal vulnerabilities, location of physical assets, work force pattern-of-life, and other information [3], in order to construct a deliberate attack on a specific capability? The goal of this topic is to develop tools to characterize and assess the nature, persistence, and quality of data. The tools should be based on principled scientific methods for sampling and relevant statistical methods for assessment. Also of interest are tools to characterize the quality of data for automated processing and analysis (i.e., a measure of how much manpower would be required to use a specific source). Additionally, the goal of this topic is to characterize the threat through the creation of tools, techniques, and methodologies to measure the vulnerabilities in a given set of public data. As an example, reconstructing the profile of an organization from many data pieces using low computational-complexity methods might indicate vulnerability. Also of interest to this topic is the development of sensors, tools, and techniques necessary to defend against the malicious use of data for purchase. Throughout the performance of this research (Phases I, II, and III), there will be no indefinite collection or storage of data sources containing personal identifying information (PII).

Current methods of identifying fab of origin are generic. These methods currently include matching observed on-chip ground rules used for polygon widths and spaces to values connected to a particular company in the literature; or finding distinctive structures or materials that are associated with specific company advertised capabilities. The Department of Defense anticipates multiple uses for such a capability, generally in the domain of improving supply chain integrity. This project seeks to find specific structural, chemical, magnetic, or electrical properties of generic on-chip features which are unique to a semiconductor fabrication facility, and which can be used as fingerprints to deterministically identify the origin of a component. Even within the same lithography node and process gate definition, certain idiosyncrasies associated with manufacturing tool installations, altitude and geomagnetic location of the facility, and chemical sources may assert detectable differences in the resulting product which can be observed or measured. Examples of facility-specific structure differences might include: specific sidewall etch angle, front-end-of line agglomeration, amount of gate activation, dose/energy/junction positioning of implants, segregation of dopants, gettering, metal line grain sizes, or wire liner thickness isotropies. Virtually thousands of characteristics and parametrics might be associated with a given chip, and indeed multiple chips and processes might be produced in a given fab simultaneously; from these, the performer will be expected to identify those parametrics that are sufficiently unique in their statistical presentation, even when compared to the same process installed in other semiconductor fabrication facilities, or across different processes. It should be assumed that these features must be recognized without the benefit of having a specific metrology or reference structures pre-placed for the purpose of identification. Analysis shall be limited to features commonly available on electronic components. While non-destructive electrical testing to determine identity provides the most utility for the application, proposals advancing destructive analysis are also acceptable. Techniques which in addition enable an estimation of the date of manufacture are encouraged.

(2) Mobility through harsh unimproved terrain is difficult due to soft soils, narrow, and steep trails. A lightweight approach to effective two-wheel drive in motorcycles is highly desirable. (3) A rapid and stealthy approach toward enemy combatants enhances the element of surprise, but the vehicles used for rapid mobility are generally compromised by vehicular noise. (4) A desire to improve vehicular fuel efficiency. Technologies relevant to this SBIR are being pursued for a variety of mobility applications. Higher power density diesel engines are being developed for aviation, although these tend to be of a larger capacity than desired for motorcycles. While smaller than aviation diesels, auto diesels are typically twice the weight of their equivalent gasoline-fueled counterparts. The US Military had purchased the Hayes M1030M1 diesel-powered motorcycle, but that vehicle is no longer in production. The Dutch EVA Trac T800 is the only heavy-fuel motorcycle currently on the market and it is designed around a purpose-built diesel engine. Heavy fuel fed reformers and fuel cells have been used for stationary power applications. They are starting to see limited market penetration in larger mobility applications. The DARPA Vulture program for example is pursuing fuel cells with an energy density suitable for aircraft applications. Turbines have been used for their heavy fuel capability by a variety of platforms, ranging from tanks to missiles. Unfortunately, they often suffer from comparatively high fuel consumption and noise suppression challenges. Hybrid-electric power has penetrated a wide variety of mobility markets ranging from construction equipment and busses to personal automobiles. Following over 15 years of exploratory work by universities, small start-ups, and major motorcycle companies, hybrid motorcycles are on the verge of reaching the marketplace. A variety of hybrid concepts have appeared at shows including Yamaha’s Gen-Ryu and HV-X, and the Schneider-OCC hybrid electric chopper. The Piaggio MP3 Hybrid 300ie three wheeled scooter reached the market in 2010. These examples, those that have tried and failed, as well as those that are currently under development have been for on-road applications, which can more easily tolerate greater weights. They have also relied on gasoline (Otto-cycle)/generator pairs or in a few instances, hydrogen fuel-cells. All-wheel drive or two-wheel drive motorcycles have been experimented with for nearly a century and have experienced limited commercial success. The long-term American product is the small Rokon Ranger with a mechanically driven front wheel. Newer to the market is Christini Corp’s AWD 450. Other current developments include the hydraulically driven Yamaha WR450F 2-Trac, and KTM’s recent patent for an electric front wheel drive. While the various pieces of interest exist in isolation, nobody has successfully combined heavy fuel capability, 2WD, and hybrid powertrains into a useful off-road motorcycle. This is a very challenging component and system design problem. This SBIR proposes to address the challenge through the innovative application of technology to develop a motorcycle capable of improving support for soldiers operating in remote and harsh environments. Desired characteristics of the vehicle include: • Silent electric only mode and low noise (<75 dB) during normal operation • Production of supplemental power, e.g., for battery charging • Two-wheel-drive in support of extreme terrain operations • Heavy fuel compatibility • > 10% improvement in load-specific fuel consumption as compared to existing fielded motorcycles",590,4024,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a preliminary design for the hybrid motorcycle, establish and validate performance goals, and develop a detailed analysis of expected performance.

Future vehicle designs will push the limits of C-C material capabilities requiring a continued effort to characterize and improve the performance, robustness, availability, and affordability of integrated airframe structures fabricated using this material. Large scale assemblies drive the current state of the art due to the unique set of challenges they present, in particular thick aerodynamic and thermal load carrying laminates. Technology development is required to produce stronger, more reliable, and more producible thick parts (reduced manufacturing time and cost) and thermo- mechanical stress models, as well as higher resolution and more informative non-destructive evaluations. Once developed, the structural properties and techniques will have an immediate impact on production time and vehicle weights, which will translate into quicker lead times and turnaround for multiple vehicle flight test programs. The purpose of this SBIR is to improve the strength and consistency of thick C-C laminates used on large scale, load bearing airframe structures.

For quantum key distribution in fibers, for instance, the noise properties of the detectors limit the distance over which one can establish a secure key. Similarly, for 3D imaging via LADAR, longitudinal resolution is limited by the detector jitter while the detector sensitivity dictates the trade-off between illumination power and maximum range. Therefore, a high-bandwidth, high-sensitivity, compact and readily available photon-counting detector is a key technology for many future scientific developments and improved DoD application capabilities. Technologies for detecting single photons in the telecom band include semiconductor devices such as Geiger-mode InGaAs avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and superconducting devices like the transition edge sensor (TES). The InGaAs APDs can be operated at temperatures accessible via thermoelectric cooling, making them ideal for applications requiring compact photon-counting solutions. InGaAs APDs, however, are typically plagued by after-pulsing effects, making them ill-suited for applications requiring high duty-cycle and high-rate detection [1]. Extremely high efficiency and low dark counts can be achieved with superconducting TES detectors, but the rates are limited to less than 10 MHz and the systems must be operated in the 100 mK regime requiring an extensive cooling overhead [2]. New results in superconducting nanowire devices [3] have shown that high detection rates, low dark-count rates (DCRs), and high efficiency are all possible simultaneously with operating temperatures between 1 and 4 K. Despite these results, further performance improvements are needed. For example, detection efficiency (DE) above 90% and bandwidth (BW) approaching 1 GHz has yet to be achieved simultaneously. In addition, innovations leading to a reduction in the system footprint and improved operability will provide better accessibility of such technologies to the relevant scientific and engineering communities. The goal of this SBIR project is to further improve upon the current state-of-the-art in nanowire single-photon detector performance while advancing the supporting technologies to allow for a compact, turn-key commercial system. The final system should provide multiple (>2), independent single-pixel detectors with performance superior to all current commercially available options (DE>90%, BW~1GHz, DCR< 1 Hz) in a ~5U 19™ rack-mount package. To achieve these goals, work under this SBIR may include the following: efforts to increase fabrication yields through the use of new materials or fabrication techniques, new device designs to improve bandwidth and sensitivity, efforts to reduce system SWaP through compact, application-specific cooling systems, electronics, and packaging.",405,2936,1,No,No,No,,Develop an initial concept design and model through computer simulations key elements of the proposed nanowire single-photon detection system.

The Transition Readiness Level to be reached is 5: Component and/or bread-board validation in relevant environment.,"The detectors developed under this SBIR will have applications for the DoD which include secure communications and active stand-off imaging systems. The improved availability and SWaP will allow the use of these detectors in all relevant government labs and open the door to new fieldable systems. For example, low power, portable optical communication links exceeding RF system bandwidths by 10-100x may be possible using the technology developed under this SBIR [4,5]. The technology developed as a consequence of this effort will have applications which span both DoD and non-DoD areas. One application particularly suited to the private sector is the analysis of integrated circuits (IC). Failure analysis via optical means is known to provide specific information about the operation of individual IC elements. Higher speed and sensitivity of detection leads to higher throughput for such diagnostic systems. Additionally, the technology developed under this SBIR may be integrated into commercially manufactured DoD products such as LADAR and optical communication systems.",1,"M.

These external stressors typically elicit acute and/or chronic inflammatory responses as the body initiates the healing process. Advances at the interface of the nervous and immune systems are critical to understanding inflammation and ultimately optimizing human performance via the reduction of inflammation. While the nervous and immune systems were previously thought to serve and act distinctly, a picture of an integrated communication and protective system is beginning to emerge (1). Recent developments in neurophysiology and immunology have begun to make the connection between neural reflexes and inflammation/immunity (2). Better descriptions of the ways in which peripheral neurons interact with immune cells may enable a more comprehensive understanding of inflammation, leading to potential therapies or approaches to speed healing. Additionally, the development of techniques to track and functionally manipulate ion flows in cells has started to elucidate the possible roles of voltage gradients in the regulation of cell behaviors (3). Bioelectrical cell signaling studies are already providing insights in developmental and cancer biology (4, 5), and further technological advancements in the field would enable the characterization of the neural/immune interface. Microelectrodes are powerful tools for quantitative, real-time, single- and multi-cell electrophysiology that require direct physical contact, which can limit their utility for various types of measurement. Additionally, they are limited in terms of spatial resolution and the ability to localize bioelectric activity and structure at the same time. Furthermore, electrical methods are often designed to measure events that exceed action potential thresholds, whilst important bioelectric activity can occur at voltage levels below action potential thresholds. Ideal tools for bioelectric measurements would offer sub-cellular resolution, high contrast, high dynamic range, and the ability to probe large fields of view with many cells in real-time. Current optical methods have advantages, yet also suffer in sensitivity (signal to noise) and require temporal averaging, thereby reducing temporal resolution. Thus, efforts to measure important bioelectric codes that guide cell fate and influence immunity still suffer from trade-offs in spatial, temporal, and voltage resolution, as well as the ability to record many cells and structures simultaneously. This solicitation calls for the development of new voltage- and/or field-sensitive dyes designed to probe the bioelectrical states of cells in neural as well as non-neural systems. Commonly available voltage dyes focus on calcium signaling and provide insight into fast processes (millisecond timescale). Certain bioelectrical interrogations may benefit from different chemistries and timescales, as well as the ability to detect sub-threshold activation of neurons and other cells, thereby requiring a finer voltage (and/or electric field) resolution. Additional challenges with current state-of-the-art voltage dyes include high cost for the volume of dye typically required for in vivo studies, low contrast, and low signal-to-noise ratios. Recent examples of methods with promise to improve performance for voltage and field sensing include fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes, voltage-sensitive proteins, and other nanoparticles such as quantum dots and NV-diamonds. Combined with new optical imaging approaches that offer unprecedented fields of view at sub-cellular resolution, successful advancements in probe technology will enable transition to academic, government, and commercial researchers to propel the field by offering, for example, lower cost, better stability, greater brightness, a broader range of absorption and emission wavelengths, higher voltage/field resolution, calibration simplicity, and increased specificity in targeting of cell regions.",581,4217,1,No,No,No,,"Design a new voltage-sensitive probe that addresses at least one of the following technical challenges for measuring bioelectrical states of cells in neural as well as non-neural systems: a) Improvement of voltage and/or electric field resolution to detect sub-threshold activation of neurons and other cells (e.g., approach the ability to report differences of several mV). b) Ability to probe at longer (seconds to minutes) or shorter (microseconds) timescales than currently available (milliseconds). c) Extension to multiple cell types and/or specific cell regions not currently accessible.

This capability is critical to understanding inflammation and its relation to human performance in order to address DoD challenges. The ultimate realization of the underlying technologies will advance healing and performance in the context of physical demands specific to the warfighter, including musculoskeletal stress and injury related to heavy equipment and gear, high physical exertion in tactical environments, and potential exposure to a variety of known and emerging pathogens and toxins. The successful development of a new voltage-sensitive probe will propel advances in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors with the end goal of understanding the bioelectrical underpinnings of inflammation and immunity to promote health and healing.

The stability and accuracy of these devices impact the performance of communication, navigation, surveillance, and missile guidance systems. Atomic clocks are at the cores of many of these systems, either directly or via time-transfer from a master clock. By employing techniques used in current laboratory atomic clocks, military clocks can be improved by orders-of-magnitude. Such clocks will enable secure data routing, communication systems that are insensitive to jamming, higher resolution coherent radar, and more reliable and robust global positioning. Laser-cooled optical lattice atomic clocks are currently the world's most stable clocks, with stability below 10^-18 at 6 hours of averaging [1]. DARPA's QuASAR program aims to miniaturize and ruggedize such high-performance optical atomic clocks for deployment in the field [2]. While this work could enable widespread adoption of optical clock technology, many applications cannot tolerate the size, weight, and power (SWaP) of these first generation portable optical clocks (S > 50 L, W > 50 kg, P > 150 W). DARPA's Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) program has developed miniature microwave atomic clocks with extremely low SWaP values (S ~ 16 cm^3, W ~ 35 g, P ~ 125 mW) and good short-term stability (10^-10 at 1 sec) [3]. However these clocks drift over long timescales making them unsuitable for many applications.

To achieve these goals, this SBIR will combine aspects of the two extreme clock architectures mentioned above: laser cooling (as used in QuASAR optical clocks) and microwave hyperfine transitions (as used in CSAC). Alternative strategies will also be considered if sufficiently justified.

Present-day intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions often require the UUV to remain submerged for extended periods of time. Although ground velocity sensor systems such as Doppler Velocity Logs (DVLs) have been successfully designed and tested for large and medium scale vehicles, their deployment onboard small UUVs is often impractical for size, weight and power (SWaP) reasons. One of the smallest, currently available DVLs on the market weighs 6+ lbs [1], and thus accounts for a large portion of the weight budget for a small UUV. Additionally, although the accuracy of velocity measurements has rapidly improved over the last decade, an error accumulation within the navigation solution is still unavoidable for long-endurance ISR missions due to the lack of true position feedback. Recent advances in sonar technology have led to a significant reduction in hardware size and power consumption [2,3]. A trade- off for small sonar units exists in the relatively high frequency of the ping(s) leading to a limited maximum range of just a few hundred meters. However, for shallow water applications, sonar based navigation solutions may provide an alternative to and/or complement DVL technology by providing true position feedback. In particular, the detected range and bearing angle of features and/or landmarks within the field of view can be utilized to enhance the overall navigation solution via, for example, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) [4,5].",259,1741,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a preliminary system design concept combining software and hardware components for a complete navigation solution.

Fully-electric tanks require a lightweight, compact electrical system to power the drive train and electric armor. Electric ships demand pulsed power for rail guns, propulsion, radar, and superconducting degaussing systems. Airborne pulsed microwave weapons require energy dense and rapid discharge capacitors in order to reduce the total weight of the system on board. The increased burden and elevated performance requirements on the electrical systems to carry out many of these functions simultaneously have created a need for better passive electrical components, particularly capacitors. These capacitors must have long endurance times, high energy storage, high thermal stability and rapid discharge capabilities. Currently-fielded capacitors suffer from low energy density, making them bulky. Additionally, their poor performance is only compounded at high operating temperatures, which reduces the energy density. This is largely due to the need to manufacture these capacitors at such a scale that the designer dielectrics being made in laboratories are unable meet this large scale demand. This leaves, for example, only unoptimized bulk polymers available for capacitor manufacturers to use. Because these polymers are not necessarily optimized for capacitor manufacturing, there is a severe limitation in the selection and consequently this lack of variability has led to an under-performance of the potential that the dielectric material could contribute to the capacitor’s total performance. Recent progress [1,2] in novel, scalable fabrication and processing of off-the-shelf dielectric materials offers several routes by which rapid innovations can be made, but none are optimized for capacitor manufacturing. In particular, multi-layer films have demonstrated that novel innovations in fabrication can lead to dramatically enhanced capacitance [1] despite using a limited selection of high dielectric polymers. Additionally, high temperature processing may be required to meet the high temperature requirements of these capacitors which may require innovations in manufacturing equipment. Also, innovations in ceramic capacitor [3,4] processing have shown the viability of this family of capacitors for scalable manufacturing. All technologies providing high energy and high temperatures in manufacturable quantities will be considered.",344,2493,1,No,No,No,,"Design a scalable process for manufacturing capacitors with energy density > 2 J/cc, operating temperature > 160 C, a total energy storage > 1000J, and pulse discharge 10,000 hours should be included.

Establish feasibility of the approach through laboratory demonstrations of critical components.","Carry out the design process developed in Phase I with the goal of (1) producing a prototype capacitor that meets the requirements for a proposer-chosen DoD platform and (2) providing evidence for the scalability necessary to meet the needs of that platform. The prototype should be tested to assure that it meets the technical requirements outlined in Phase I. To demonstrate scalability, at least a 1000J capacitor bank and the individual capacitors for that 1000J capacitor bank must be delivered and tested for uniformity and consistency to determine if the sample set meets the tolerances of the target platform.","Capacitors that can meet the aggressive goals of this SBIR will find immediate use in current and future military systems. For current naval platforms, a high temperature and high energy density capacitor would be beneficial for power conditioning for new radar platforms, rail guns, and superconducting electromagnets for degaussing. Design and development of components for a fully-electric tank and electric ships are currently underway and would benefit from this advancement. Airborne pulsed microwave weapons would also benefit from lightweight, pulsed capacitors. Phase III will include showcases and demonstrations to interested government agencies to show the capacitor’s performance under the stressful conditions of interest for each agency. Energy-dense capacitors with high temperature stability are key components in electric and hybrid vehicles. Their dramatic rise in recent years is expected to fuel a strong demand for high-stamina, lightweight capacitors. Regenerative breaking and other electrically-based energy recovery systems used in automobiles and trains rely critically on capacitors that can efficiently capture energy in brief pulses of electrical activity.",1,"Integrated High Energy Density Capacitors, DARPA Program, http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/DSO/Programs/Integrated_High_Energy_Dense_Capacitors.aspx 5.; Chao, Sheng, and Fatih Dogan.

There is a rich history of programming language support for model-based development of systems including languages such as Esterel and RMPL. Tools to support model based development include languages, compilers, editors and property checkers. Most modeling languages support the representation of changes in state variables of such systems, and many support constraints on these state variable changes. Some languages even support uncertainty in state variables, or uncertain observation of state values. However none support probabilistic variables as first class objects whose values come from a probability distribution, as in probabilistic programming languages such as Church. Probabilistic programming languages, on the other hand, generally fail to supply the high level support needed for modeling cyber-physical systems and are thus less well suited to the development of complex control or planning applications involving such systems. A unified probabilistic model-based programming language should be able to model various kinds of uncertain processes, such as Markov Decision Processes, Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

For example, Special Operations Forces typically train and deploy in austere areas that are associated with an increased risk of envenomation. Bites by venomous snakes cause: severe paralysis that may prevent breathing; bleeding disorders that can lead to fatal hemorrhage; irreversible kidney failure; and severe local tissue destruction that cause permanent disability and limb amputation. Current treatment of venomous bites requires correct identification of the venomous species to select the appropriate anti-venom, but identification of the specific species is frequently problematic or mistaken. If an antivenom is available for an identified species, it must be administered in a higher echelon military treatment facility in part due to the risk of severe adverse reactions such as serum sickness and hypersensitivity. The World Health Organization recently declared snake-bite a neglected tropical disease, with approximately 2.5 million poisonings from snake-bite occurring each year. Annually, snake bites result in at least 100,000 deaths and around three times as many amputations. While many antivenoms exist throughout the world, significant challenges exist in their manufacture and effective use. The majority of antivenoms are based on species-specific immune reaction to venom exposure. Antivenom manufacture is problematic - few countries produce snake venoms of adequate quality and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production of antivenom is resource-intensive and costly. Very few antivenoms are approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The development of techniques for laser cooling and manipulation of alkali atoms has revolutionized atomic physics in recent decades, including laboratory-scale demonstrations of atomic clocks and inertial sensors (gyroscopes and accelerometers) based on laser-cooled atomic samples, which have demonstrated extraordinary performance. These include high-performance atomic ""fountain” clocks and cold-atom interferometers. The DARPA/MTO Microtechnology for Position, Navigation and Timing Program (microPNT) is developing low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP+C) timing units and inertial sensors based on cold-atom technology. These programs have shown that the scaling laws of cold-atom physics allow the development of miniature devices that promise disruptive capabilities in portable low-SWaP+C devices. While the development of the physics techniques and architectures for portable sensors is ongoing under microPNT, transition of this technology to practical deployment requires the development of a number of supporting components and technologies. The proposed Cold-Atom MicroSystems (CAMS) SBIR topic represents an initial step towards the development and supply availability of the necessary component technologies. The DARPA MTO office believes that many of the necessary skills and capabilities to investigate the development of these components are present in U.S. based small businesses and that these organizations are best capable to demonstrate the agility to rapidly investigate and prototype candidate device technology. Of particular necessity to the development of portable robust low-SWaP+C cold atom microsystems are the following proposed topic areas: 1. Light Sources: The CAMS SBIR topic seeks novel approaches to producing low-SWaP+C narrow-linewidth optical sources at wavelengths of interest, including 780 nm, 795 nm, 852 nm, and 894 nm. Of particular interest are devices that demonstrate sub-MHz linewidths (1 kHz resolution BW) and deliver > 10 mW of output power, with overall wall-plug efficiency (WPE) of > 25%, including all necessary temperature-stabilization and control electronics in a DoD-relevant environment. Of particular note here is the relatively high loss and SWaP+C of Faraday optical isolators at these wavelengths (addressed separately below), which are typically necessary to ensure narrow-linewidth operation in the presence of optical back-reflections. Towards this end, the topic also welcomes proposals for laser devices whose linewidth is relatively insensitive to back-reflections and/or devices which incorporate on-chip optical isolation. 2. Optical Isolators: The CAMS SBIR invites proposals for miniature, low-loss Faraday optical isolators at the wavelengths of interest (see above). This may include the investigation of novel materials or architectures for low SWaP+C high-throughput isolation. Successful development will deliver isolators that occupy a volume less than 0.5cc with less than 1 dB forward loss, greater than 40 dB isolation, and greater than 1mm clear aperture. 3. Precise and Agile Laser Frequency/Wavelength Control: CAMS typically require that the laser wavelength be stabilized with a precise and rapidly adjustable offset to a reference atomic resonance. The CAMS SBIR solicits novel approaches to low-SWaP+C atomic-resonance offset laser stabilization. This may include novel techniques for acousto- or electro-optical modulation as well as techniques for offset-locking to miniature atomic vapor cells, etalons, or other reference structures. Typical requirements might include 0-2 GHz offset control, > 100 kHz tuning bandwidth, and overall size and power not to exceed 1 cm^3 and 10 mW, respectively. 4. Laser Shuttering: CAMS require rapid and high-extinction shuttering of laser light at the aforementioned wavelengths, typically < 10 microseconds and 70 dB, respectively. This SBIR seeks proposals for low-SWaP+C shuttering technology, based on MEMS or electro-optic techniques. Preference will be given to proposals which simultaneously address co-integration with one or more of the topics above. 5. Alkali Vapor Pressure Control: For optimum operation, CAMS require that the background alkali vapor pressure inside the vacuum chamber of the cold-atom device be maintained at a stable equivalent vapor pressure of 10-20°C (depending on the alkali species and details of the apparatus). Maintaining constant alkali vapor pressure over the full DoD ambient temperature range (-40°C to +85°C) is a significant challenge, particularly in a low-SWaP+C package, without the use of (high-power) thermoelectric coolers. The CAMS SBIR invites proposals for the investigation and development of novel techniques for alkali vapor pressure control, with preference given to the development of novel materials and/or systems which permit bidirectional control (e.g. source or getter) without consumption of alkali material. 6. Micro-Scale Vacuum Pump Technology: CAMS typically require extraordinarily high vacuum conditions (< 10^-9 Torr) to mitigate the detrimental effects of background ""hot” atoms colliding with the cold atomic sample. The CAMS SBIR topic seeks innovative proposals for low-SWaP+C vacuum pumps, particularly those which effectively pump noble gases, such as helium, and which do not produce externally-detectable magnetic fields. The ultimate objective of the program would be to demonstrate a micro-scale vacuum pump capable of sustained pumping at a rate of 0.01 liters/second, occupying a volume of < 1 cm^3, and consuming < 10 mW of power.",801,5677,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I of the effort would design and investigate an innovative concept for the enabling technology for cold atom microsystems being proposed.

Small SWaP+C self-contained clocks and IMUs are in very high demand. Current programs at DARPA are pursing the miniaturization of cold atom technology for such applications as missile guidance, mounted and dismounted soldier navigation in GPS denied environments, or pseudolite navigation. While much progress is being made on existing microPNT programs to miniaturize these devices, the timeline to bring the tech to the warfighter is limited by the availability of the component technology addressed in this SBIR topic. An investment in enabling technology for cold atom microsystems, particularly in the highly relevant small-business arena, will fast-track the technology development of deployable cold atom based inertial sensors and clocks. Since the successful transition of the DARPA-MTO Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC), a wide variety of commercial applications for atomic-quality, low-SWaP+C timing have emerged. Many of these applications, particularly in telecommunications, electronic test, and remote sensing, would benefit greatly from improved timing accuracy, such as may be enabled by cold-atom microsystems.",1,"R.

Systems with the added ability to program and transmit electrical pulses to the implanted electrodes in order to provide precise neural stimulation are highly desired.,"High performance prosthesis systems require high-bandwidth real-time communication of neural signals into and out of the body. Current implantable neural interfaces rely on transcutaneous cables to transmit recorded data and to receive power. These transcutaneous connections greatly limit the mobility of the patient, increase the risk of infection, and significantly reduce the long-term reliability of the entire neural-interface system through mechanical failure. Although clinically-available [1] and laboratory-grade [2] telemetry systems exist, none meet the stringent demands required to telemeter high-bandwidth information for high-performance prostheses. There has been significant academic research addressing portions of this challenge [3, 4], but none have taken a systems-level approach or yielded a manufacturable technology. The goal of this effort is to develop a one-size-fits-many solution for the capability gap in the prosthesis community, with broad applicability to neuroscience and neuroengineering. Proposals should aim to develop a uni- or bi-directional telemetry system, capable of transmitting at least 16 channels of high-bandwidth real-time neural signals and operating power across the skin. The architecture’s scalability to higher channel count and firmware upgradability to add new in-situ analysis capabilities are strongly desired. The dynamic range of the recording channels should enable capture of neural signals in the micro Volt to Volt range. Such a system must be capable of reliable, chronic use and have a credible trajectory towards FDA [4], FCC, and IEC approval in order to serve the broad medical community for a variety of treatment applications. Traditional chest-mounted telemetry systems require lengthy, limited-bandwidth, failure-prone interconnects between the point of measurement and the transceiver. Successful proposals will describe a functional system with a small form factor to overcome existing problems and allow the telemetry system to be in close proximity to the anatomical target, eliminating issues that may arise from repetitive joint movement. Proposers must consider that various anatomical targets provide distinct electrical signals to record/stimulate, mechanical environments, and abiotic/biotic environments. Proposed systems that are applicable to one or more of the following anatomical targets are highly desired: the central-nervous-system (CNS) both epidural and subdural [5, 6, 7], the peripheral-nervous-system (PNS) [8, 9, 10, 11], and in residual or reconstructed muscles, cells or fibers [12, 13]. Systems are expected to support a variety of neural interfaces developed for the specific anatomical target. For example a system for direct PNS interfaces would have the ability to support neural probes manufactured by Blackrock, Neuronexus, Microprobes, Tucker-Davis and other international suppliers. In order to demonstrate a viable prototype by the end of this SBIR, all aspects of system development must be addressed: wireless protocols (telemetry and power), application programming interfaces for CANbus prostheses and USB-connected computers, battery-powered externally-worn electronics, implantable electronics, mechanical modeling and testing of implantable package and interconnects (if any), hermetic sealing, thermal budget under operating conditions, and design for operation in a realistic environment (operating range through tissue, EMI, simulated mechanical behavior). It is expected that the electronics portion will require development of safety features, bioelectric amplification, DAC/ADC, signal processing, power conversion from wireless to battery or capacitive storage, operational reconfigurability (e.g., FPGA), and data telemetry. Successful proposals may also include, but are not required to contain, some integrated processing, analysis, and data compression capability in cases where techniques may not be available to telemeter all of the unprocessed information to and from the system. Due to the implanted nature of the envisioned system, all capabilities must be fully demonstrated in an appropriate simulated tissue environment, and under accelerated testing conditions equivalent to at least twenty years of operation.",581,4248,1,No,No,No,,"Develop preliminary design concept and determine technological feasibility of a low-power, low-latency, high-bandwidth telemetry system for clinical use.

Looking forward, novel neural interfaces are being designed and developed that enable closed-loop sensing, onboard computation, and action all within a fully implantable device (1). Current implantable devices rely on battery power which limits operational lifetimes of the devices and introduces risk to patients including tissue damage from battery leakage and surgical procedures to replace depleted batteries. Harvesting power directly from innate processes of the body represents an attractive alternative to batteries for future neural interfaces. Research into energy-harvesting strategies to replace batteries in biomedical devices has produced a variety of methods to extract power from mechanical, electrical, chemical and thermal processes in the human body (2, 3). Strategies have shown promise for powering ultra-low power sensors (4, 5), however, the power required for a fully implantable and adaptable closed-loop sensing and stimulation system far exceeds the current capabilities of energy harvesting technology. Additionally, strategies for energy harvesting to power medical devices in organs such as the heart may not be suitable for powering neural devices. It has been suggested that fuel cell strategies leveraging glucose in the cerebral spinal fluid may be physiologically viable and able to produce adequate power, but these technologies have not been tested in vivo (4). The amount of power required for an adaptable, closed-loop neural interface depends on a number of factors including frequency of sensing and stimulation, and computational burden of modeling and control algorithms. This solicitation calls for the development of energy harvesting strategies from natural processes in the human body that will result in the ability to power a fully implantable neural interface during sensing, analyzing and stimulating multiple brain regions for therapeutic purposes. Elimination of batteries in these neural interfaces will lead to smaller, more reliable, longer lasting, and more effective devices. Successful advancements in energy harvesting technology will enable next generation neurotechnologies to transition to academic, government, and commercial researchers to gain a much deeper understanding of brain function, and to clinicians to improve the quality of life for service members and veterans.",357,2520,1,No,No,No,,"Develop preliminary design concept and determine technological feasibility of bio-harvesting energy strategies to power fully implantable, closed-loop neural interfaces for a minimum of ten years.

These systems can include plasma thrusters, high-speed air/space vehicles, radiation effect simulators and systems employing high-voltage, high-power drivers such as railguns and RF sources. For example, in z-pinch driven effects simulators, the plasma can be adequately described initially using a fluid approach when coupled to an appropriate circuit model of the driver. However, as the pinch implodes, kinetic effect plays a significant role and must be accounted for in the simulations in order to calculate the correct radiation output. Overall the above systems are of relevance to multiple users in the Army, Air Force, and Navy. Currently, simulation tools exist to model these behaviors in the relevant setting and in many cases have achieved predictive capabilities. However, in many scenarios these simulations require computation resources at a scale not practical for device parameter scans and optimization; for example, in cases where kinetic effects are important, usually the entire problem must be done kinetically even if parts of the problem would be amendable to a simpler and faster fluid approach. Additionally, current commercially available state-of-the art approaches such as Particle-in-Cell (PIC) codes have not been scalable to new massively parallel CPU-GPU architectures. Overall, simulation packages currently used do not have all the desired attributes integrated, specifically, 1) the ability to switch between fluid and kinetic approaches in-situ in the calculation; 2) scalability to massively parallel CPU-GPU architectures, and 3) robust implicit and auto-mesh refinement algorithms that work with 1) and 2). A further complication is the requirement that the software architecture retain the above attributes while simultaneously allowing easy incorporation of physics sub-models required for simulating specific problems; for example, radiation production and transport physics required for some source simulations, and atomic and materials physics models required for breakdown simulations.

After being processed, the results must be transmitted back to the tactical operators who collected the data in the first place.

As a consequence, only a small percentage of the data available to the tactical warfighter is actually processed, and an even smaller percentage is made available to them.

Often, many power supply units are needed in an electronic system and therefore can significantly affect the efficiency, overall size and cost. Energy efficiency also impacts size and cost, particularly in portable electronic devices, because of limited battery capacity and the desire to reduce the need for additional cooling enabling smaller and cheaper devices. Integration of on-chip power supplies is a way to improve all three aspects simultaneously and is therefore highly desirable. Current power supplies/voltage regulators with discrete components are relatively large and operate at low frequencies. The size of the footprint (area) and height is driven in part by the large size of the output filter that is required at the typically relatively low switching frequencies (~1MHz). The silicon CMOS power supply circuit also contributes to a large footprint due to high current drive requirements. Transistors capable of higher switching frequencies and higher output current densities would enable smaller inductors and capacitors and more compact circuits leading to a decrease in overall size. One possible solution to increase the switching frequency of voltage regulators is the use of switching transistors based on compound semiconductors (GaAs, GaN, SiC, etc.). Heterogeneously integrating these transistor switches (such as transistor pairs for buck converters) with the Si CMOS driver circuit on-chip as an ultra-compact power stage would provide much reduced size and highly-efficient power conversion.

When facing a near peer adversary, the critical battle management challenge for such architectures will be to organize and direct semi-isolated teams of air vehicles operating under great uncertainty regarding the enemy state and the status and plans of other friendly assets. Battle management today is a largely manual process relying on robust communications. Under limited uncertainty, performance optimization techniques provide a solid framework for the design of battle management decision aids. Classic performance optimization techniques can be extended to tolerate moderate uncertainty [1], and to operate within the tight constraints of a denied airspace. However, as uncertainty increases, robustness, and not optimal performance, must be the principal concern. In fact, as shown recently in [2], the architecture of complex systems —natural and man-made—is primarily dictated by a need for robustness, and not to maximize performance. Under extreme uncertainty it is likely easier, and preferable, to maximize robustness of an adequately performing solution, than to optimize performance itself. For this topic, alternatives to traditional command and control approaches are sought that are specially tailored for extreme conditions. Proposals should detail algorithms and system architectures to increase robustness by steering the performance envelope of the systems' sub-teams away from areas likely to interact unfavorably with uncertain conditions. Evidence for the value of this approach is found in the study of social and commercial interactions. Research in social sciences and psychology has long studied the factors that maximize the value created by distributed agents when transaction costs are high. In particular the work presented in [3] shows that, in a given population of interdependent actors, ""positive coordination” within small coalitions who are required to obtain the agreement of outside actors through ""negative coordination” are able to achieve high welfare gains while economizing on transaction costs. A second relevant observation is that teamwork is, above all, based upon a layer of trust among team members. Trust is even more important in a combat-like environment in which humans and machines are working collaboratively. An untrustworthy autonomous system, instead of being helpful, quickly becomes one more thing to worry about during an already stressful situation. A large body of research in human psychology and human-machine collaboration (see, for example, [4]), indicates that predictability of a teammate's behavior is an essential component of trust among teams. Using these principles as a starting point, proposals should develop a dynamic coordination and deconfliction framework that would enable consistent performance of man machine teams operating under severe uncertainty, without requiring unsustainable cognitive loads on mission personnel. Such a capability will provide warfighters with a decisive advantage against a near peer – providing the capability to optimally respond to the situation in real time and accomplish the mission, despite great uncertainty.",465,3236,1,No,No,No,,"Select a specific peer threat (an adversary whose capabilities rival our own) and highly contested environment mission (such as the suppression of enemy air defenses).

Further, develop algorithms that compute constraints on the interactions with other sub-teams in order to maintain some level of effectiveness and predictability. The Phase I deliverable is a final report that includes a detailed analysis of predicted performance of the algorithm for the selected mission.","Develop an integrated coordination and deconfliction methodology for mixed manned-unmanned teams based on Phase I algorithms.

This revolutionary new system capability is envisioned to have the ultimate potential to replace the essential, but dated military standard Night Vision Goggles (NVG).","Night vision goggles and other devices based on image intensifier tubes have been around for decades [1]. While the resolution and contrast of these NVG has improved, progress has been very slow to decrease their weight and size while increasing the field of view (FOV). The awkward, intrusive and cumbersome procedures for mounting, removal and/or holding these devices for the soldier can impair their ability to perform basic tasks and operations. Frequent usage of current NVGs increases the risk for short-term and long-term neck injuries, due to weight and form factor. Additionally, since these are analog devices, there are no provisions for sharing information for increased situational awareness (SA) with others in the squad or command centers. Furthermore, the proliferation and commoditization of night vision technology has eroded the tactical advantage of night operations enjoyed by the U.S. military. By moving next generation night vision into more infrared bands, and across bands, next generation night vision technologies can help provide U.S. military forces a renewed advantage. Wearable computing technology is quickly advancing, being driven by progress in consumer electronics. An ideal vision for future soldier-relevant night and all-condition vision display technology would harness this revolution, packaging advanced night vision imaging technology in and around light, compact wearable heads-up displays (HUDs). Specific military hardware advances of interest for integration into a system solution include: (a) high-frame-rate (for mobility), low-noise, small-format short-wave infrared (SWIR) [2,3] or broad-band infrared cameras which do not require cooling; (b) handheld and weapons-mountable low-speckle SWIR illuminators and pointers; (c) clip-on SWIR imagers (COSI) for weapon sights; and (d) high-brightness large FOV see-through augmented reality (AR) heads-up displays (HUDs) [4,5,6] with low-light leakage, contrast control and Cursor-on-Target (CoT) capabilities. These advanced compact SWIR cameras routinely provide imaging capabilities throughout the near infrared (NIR) and SWIR wavelength bands (700-1700 nm), whereas, current night vision technology provides visualization only out to around 1.0 um. Ideally, one or more sensors would provide a full spectrum of coverage across Visible-NIR-SWIR (400-1700nm). Additionally, SWIR cameras provide enhanced visualization through obscurations (e.g. haze, fog, smoke) that would normally cause significant visual degradation in the visible wavelength band both with the naked eye or silicon imager cameras. With the addition of a SWIR illuminators (active SWIR), high-contrast high-resolution night and all-condition viewing is possible, providing covert viewing and targeting capabilities currently unavailable to enemy forces. Despite much active military research, wearable high-FOV NIR/SWIR viewing devices are still lacking. Further, new approaches to military night and all-condition viewing technologies are sought which could interact with emerging portable tactical computing via exchange of video, geo-position, and other situational awareness data (e.g. sound or other external sensor data). Any requisite software or computing elements should preferably be implemented on consumer devices, such as a tablet or phone, and preferably on an open-source operating system. The Cursor-on-Target (CoT) Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema is the preferred SA standard for the broad interoperability and increased transition opportunities. It is envisioned that capabilities may be enhanced via the development of future applications, enabled by an Application Programming Interface (API). Enhanced visibility and usability of the HUD in day and night time conditions is also required. Sharp, high brightness displays are sought which can present high contrast imagery even in sunny day desert conditions. Technology approaches to providing visible to SWIR light imagery from clear to dark conditions is desirable. Any such technologies should ideally present no haze or distortion to the end user and not infer undesirable polarization. Low system latency (e.g. able to effectively engage moving objects and to travel at high speeds without risking the wearer) and ability to adjust to changing light conditions are key to aid in effective transition from low to bright light conditions (e.g. entering and exiting an enclosed space or structure). In summary, a Next Generation Tactical Wearable Night Vision Device is envisioned, with Specific Objectives as listed below. It is recognized that this objective vision may not be fully realizable during the course of a Phase II SBIR. However, concrete and compelling hardware/software progress towards this vision is expected to be demonstrated. • Form Factor and Appearance that blends with commercial sunglasses/eyewear, coverage of both eyes preferable • Volume less than or equal to twice that of commercial sunglasses/eyewear • Weight less than current visual augmentation systems • Power greater than 24 hours run time on one charge, with power source included in weight metric • Cost of less than $5000 in volume of 1000 or more • Visual Acuity of Snellen 20/20 at clear starlight to direct day sun over 90 degree vertical and 120 degree horizontal Field of View (FOV) • Low latency (photon in to receipt by eye) of less than or equal to 2ms • Supports interface with tactical computing elements and communications systems, to include the transmission of sound and video to other team members • 6 Axis Inertial Measurement Unit, Compass, GPS • Interoperable external data and power interfaces • Withstand Military Specifications for environmental, EMI, and ballistics An effective demonstration would make real progress across metrics in multiple technical areas as outlined, and deliver a substantial step forward in the usability and practicality of wearable military tactical night and all-condition viewing HUD technology described as an objective system.",872,6016,1,No,No,No,,"Design a concept for a night and all-condition viewing HUD with advanced features as described.

Variations among individuals introduce unique complexities that factor into fitting the socket; these include muscle bundles, neuroma, bone spurs, and skin conditions such as scars from burns and sores from infections. Due to the difficulty of measuring socket interface characteristics without disturbing the secure fit of the socket, there is a lack of quantifiable diagnostic fitment information available to prosthetists. As a result, the process of fitting sockets is currently a labor-intensive, manual approach practiced by artisans. Current fitting techniques often yield sockets that are uncomfortable, unstable, or impede full range of motion, resulting in compromised device performance or election by the amputee to not use the prosthesis altogether. To address these challenges, DARPA seeks the development of innovative diagnostic tools for quantifying characteristics of the socket-limb interface during the fitting process, and the means of manufacturing these tools. The proposer will develop the tools for a systematic socket-fitting strategy that yields reliable and reproducible socket fitment. The tools must be able to report the interface characteristics within the socket and inform the positioning of socket components to ensure comfortable fit throughout the conduct of daily activities by the user, in particular providing a stable platform that can achieve a near-natural range of motion.

Unique to seL4 is its unparalleled degree of assurance, achieved through formal software verification -- the use of mathematical proofs to show that a piece of software satisfies specific properties. As such, seL4's implementation is formally proven functionally correct (bug-free) against its specification, is proven to enforce strong security properties, and its operations have proven safe upper bounds on their worst-case execution times [2]. The open-source release of seL4 includes source code, proofs and specifications, in addition to tools, libraries and example programs that can be used to build trustworthy systems [3]. With seL4 open-sourced, the opportunity emerges to create an extensive community of developers of dependable (safe, secure, reliable) systems, in application areas ranging from national security to automotive, avionics, medical implants, and industrial supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) automation. In the defense sector, this technology promises to lead to more secure military systems ranging from unmanned ground, air and underwater vehicles, to weapons systems, satellites, and command and control devices. However, seL4 alone is not sufficient. It provides a foundation for developing dependable systems, creating a secure software base upon which further secure software layers (i.e., system and application services) can be layered to form a trustworthy system. Consequently, DARPA seeks to develop applications that expand the ecosystem of open-source, secure software components around seL4. Some examples of ecosystem components may include communication protocols, network stacks, trusted boot, and dependable configuration tools, as well as application layers, and so on. DARPA seeks to have these ecosystem components demonstrated in the context of applications that have potential for national impact (in areas such as listed above). Note that because seL4 enables factored security arguments [4], the components and applications do not necessarily have to be fully formally verified, but they do need to have trust arguments that tie into the formal guarantees that seL4 provides, so that relevant security properties can be established.",332,2337,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a plan for building secure software components in the context of seL4, together with a plan of how these components may be used to create specific secure applications.

Combinations of latency-optimized processors, throughput-optimized processors including graphics processing units (GPUs), field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), networks, and special-purpose accelerators are now employed, or will soon be employed, in systems that support national security. New types of memories (e.g., phase-change memory, spin-transfer torque memory) may change the optimal designs for memory hierarchies. The advent of next generations of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication may push fault tolerance and dynamic resource optimizations to higher priorities for designers’ attention. Today it is challenging to enable, by languages and tools, a programmer to write code for a single application targeted to a single advanced architecture. Ideally, a programmer could write source code for any application, and have that code be compilable to run efficiently on any target architecture; this is probably impossible. For example, the avionics software developed for a major Air Force platform was not portable to architectures that differed substantially in any dimension from the initially implemented target. Software on Navy platforms has been found to be very expensive to port to revised versions of their target system architecture. The technologies developed here will result in dramatically improved ability to choose optimally cost-effective target architectures, and in greatly reduced cost for system upgrades. Moreover, because the software is portable, systems will be upgradable in phases, without requiring that all platforms of a given class be simultaneously upgraded. Innovative solutions are sought to enable, by languages and tools, a programmer to write any of a set of applications – an application domain – so that it is functionally portable and performance portable across a set of target architectures – an architecture domain. A solution may be specific to one application domain and one architecture domain. The bigger the domains, the better. The domains should be relevant to national security applications, including DoD embedded computing. A body of software is ""functionally portable” across an architecture domain if the software can be compiled to execute on any architecture in the domain, and when so executed it will produce correct results. (The exact meaning of ""correct results” is a non-trivial issue, especially when approximate computing and timing constraints are involved.) A body of software is ""performance portable” across an architecture domain if it is functionally portable across that domain, and it executes with approximately the same relative efficiency across the architecture domain. The ""relative efficiency” of a given application on a given target architecture is its efficiency expressed as a fraction of the efficiency of the hypothetical optimal software for that application on that architecture. (The exact meaning of ""efficiency” is a non-trivial issue, especially when power, energy, and reliability are included). It is desirable that whatever languages and tools are provided be productive, in the sense that only reasonable effort is required for a reasonably skilled programmer to write, debug, and tune programs in the application domain. (If technologies are proposed that result in non-deterministic behavior – i.e., the program can behave differently on different executions with the same inputs – then the consequent impact to productivity must be addressed.) Productivity is difficult to quantify; efforts that propose experimentation on human subjects are not desirable. The proposed technologies must have a plausible path for transition into national security systems. Regarding languages in particular, in order that a programming language have a significant impact, it needs a full suite of mature tools (compilers, debuggers, etc.), a maintenance or standards body to correct and enhance its specification, libraries of useful modules, and a community of users; as a result, transitioning a new language is difficult. Minor additions to or modifications of existing languages are easier to transition.",609,4198,1,No,No,No,,"The Phase 1 final report will specify the problem domain, which is a domain of target architectures and a domain of applications, and will include a technical approach and feasibility analysis for programming those applications to run on those architectures. It is not required to specify a complete programming environment. It is sufficient to specify and analyze one or a few innovative techniques. Examples of such techniques are • A method by which a programmer can determine which of two bodies of code will execute with greater efficiency across the target architecture domain. • A method for generating relatively efficient FPGA code from a conventional programming language. (See above for the definition of relative efficiency.) • A method for maintaining relative efficiency of an application across a variety of cache hierarchies. • A method to automate the use of scratchpad memory, when it’s available.","The minimum required product for the end of Phase II is a prototype implementation of the techniques defined in Phase I.

In particular, for the military wireless systems that need to communicate over long distances to other flights, platoons or to a command and control platform or command post, interference often limits communication to within the flight or platoon, denying the ability to communicate to radios outside the group. Current interference suppression focuses on the ability of each individual radio to cancel interference. A scalable technical approach is needed that can collaboratively cancel interference for a group of collaborative radios so military wireless communications can take place over large distances in the presence of interference. This technology is applicable to future communications systems developed by the Army, Air Force, and Navy. Wireless communication systems are under increased pressure from intentional or unintentional interference. The interference affects multiple radios within proximity of each other. Communications usually can take place within closely spaced groups of radios traveling as a group but no single radio has the ability to communicate to a distant radio due to limitations in transmit power or received power at the receiver due to interference. However, groups of radios can collaboratively share interference information and form distributed arrays that can suppress interference and use multichannel techniques to communicate to distant radios using techniques such as those developed for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communications. Both the desired signals and the unwanted interference are correlated at multiple receiving nodes within a group. This correlation can be leveraged to cancel or null the interference and consequently improve system performance. System performance can be improved by increasing the energy received at the distant radio group or by nulling interference at the receiving radio group. This nulling capability is particularly useful for asymmetric links where the return link and more advantaged radio has the power to transmit over great distances and has greatly reduced interference but the received signal at the forward radio group is disrupted by interference. Preliminary implementations of distributed MIMO systems focused on capacity in benign scenarios and are generally limited to closed, narrowly focused systems. Existing work does not address the complexity of radios automatically negotiating collaboration groups and roles or the advanced signal processing required to opportunistically suppress interference and increase energy to a particular location in order to maximize the link characteristics. Further, existing work does not show how different groups can optimally communicate given this information. For this effort, proposed solutions should assess the trade-off between inter-group communications to setup and maintain a collaborative multi-antenna group with differing relative motion and the relative motion of distant groups. Proposed solutions should quantify the amount of interference suppression (both in terms of interference power levels and number of distinct interferers) possible in addition to the inter-group communication bandwidth and relative velocity limit, as well as suggest optimization techniques for using some or all group members for a single communications link, multiple communications links and non-communication suppression only group members. In addition, the research should address the system impacts of maintaining synchronization between radios within the collaborative group. Also of interest is the ability to coordinate transmissions such that the desired signal is delivered to a desired location, as well as interference directed to specific alternate locations. Modeled scenarios should not be limited to only two communicating groups, but potentially several groups needing to communicate simultaneously. Analysis should be supported by experiments with actual radios, where motion can be induced or emulated to varying degrees of fidelity. Performance of desired group members in regards to the actual task should be quantified including phase noise and energy on target and interference suppression versus theoretical.",612,4308,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the necessary algorithms to perform multi-platform cooperative interference recognition, interference estimation, processing, and cancellation and/or nulling.

The ever-growing demand for wireless services, particularly for mobile devices, is driving technology to be more spectrally efficient as well as adaptive to changing channel conditions.

Leveraging recent advances in miniaturization and sensing, such as small LADAR, and bio-inspired landing and collision avoidance could enable a small, low-power-consumption navigation suite capable of delivering affordable, robust and unassisted airborne navigation.","Ensuring safe flight for unmanned vehicles historically relies on external assistance such as remote piloting, or on heavy and power-intensive sensing and control modalities such as radar and multi-axis precision inertial measurement units (IMUs), or relies on deterministic plans such as those enabled by terrain maps and precision GPS. The size, weight and power and cost (SWaP-C) limitations for the overall navigation function hinders widespread application of autonomous navigation in particular for smaller (<55 lb) platforms. Even where small partial solutions exist, costs may exceed the cost of the platform itself and can limit user willingness to employ them. Cutting the persistent tether to an operator requires both obstacle avoidance for assured safety, and dynamic mapping and navigation for utility. Recent trends in sensor miniaturization offer superior performance along with reduced SWaP-C burden. Increased on-board computational capabilities available even on smaller unmanned air systems (UAS) enable sophisticated algorithms that reduce the need for remote piloting or very high performance sensors. Object and pattern recognition advances enable mapping and localization tasks to be performed quickly. On larger platforms, they have been used for identification of, and flights to, safe landing zone in programs such as the Office of Naval Research (ONR)’s Autonomous Aerial Cargo/Utility System (AACUS) program. Similarly non-cooperative sense-and-avoid technologies have relied on heavy radar, but the capabilities of multi-spectrum optical techniques are rapidly improving as computational availability enables new real-time algorithms. Specifically, lower SWaP-C sensors have been developed in areas such as LADAR, inertial sensing and broad-spectrum optics. These sensors may be noisier and less accurate than their larger counterparts, but they have been shown to offer good solutions when collectively employed with appropriate processing algorithms. For example, novel optical sensing techniques have been borrowed from biological flyers such as Odonata-inspired horizon sensing, and the use of optic flow for precision landing and obstacle avoidance. Clever architectures have been shown to overcome problems with widely varying lighting conditions, and visual variations in targets and obstacles. Open architectures also offer the potential to reduce costs by enabling rapid incorporation of new sensors and applications, tailoring of sensor suites to particular applications, and new modalities of cooperation between flight vehicles. Specific areas of interest in this SBIR include: - Development of reduced SWaP-C optical sensors such as LADARs and optical sensors that exploit novel aspects of the spectrum and wide field of view. - Development of algorithms to extract useful guidance and navigation data from low SWaP-C optically based sensor suites - Exploitation and demonstration of open and flexible architectures that allow for rapid changes in sensors and algorithms - Exploitation of advanced sensors and control modalities The program objective is a complete navigation system with viability demonstrated via a series of flight tests and thorough cost analysis.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I Only","There is a critical need for capabilities that will enable DoD to leverage the unique and powerful attributes of biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials, novel capabilities, fuels, and medicines. This topic is focused on improving the utility of cell-free systems as a platform technology to address key technical hurdles associated with current practices in engineering biology. A successful platform should address several or all of the bottlenecks associated with the state-of-the-art in cell-free systems, including production of cell-free reagents with improved consistency and scalability, improved methods for characterizing and validating cell-free reagent preparations, new cell-free systems to expand the number of organisms capable of being modeled, and improved reproducibility of results over scaled volumes. In addition, these cell-free platforms should be distributable in a format that can be readily transitioned to academic, government, and commercial researchers, all of whom rely on the ability to rapidly assay engineered biological systems. Biological production platforms have great potential to provide new materials, capabilities, and manufacturing paradigms for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Nation. However, the complete realization of this potential has been limited by current approaches to engineering biology that rely on ad hoc, laborious, and time-consuming processes, as well as the large amount of trial and error required to generate designs of even moderate complexity. One technology that could address many of these bottlenecks is the use of cell-free systems for the rapid prototyping and testing of biological systems. Conventional approaches to engineering genetic systems rely on molecular cloning into DNA vectors, transformation or transfection of cells, antibiotic resistance-based selection, growth in appropriate media, and assaying cells for the desired function. While significant progress has been made toward improving these processes, engineering living cells is inherently costly, slow, and complex. By short circuiting many of the steps required for in vivo gene expression, cell-free systems offer several advantages that could potentially transform the state-of-the-art, including reduced cost, increased throughput, decreased system complexity, and the ability to be utilized in a distributed setting. In addition, cell-free systems enable the production and testing of cytotoxic compounds, the prototyping of pathways with toxic metabolic intermediates, and for the production of molecules, such as proteins containing non-standard amino acids, that are difficult to engineer into living systems. Although the use of cell-free assays has significant potential to rapidly engineer and test biological systems, several technical hurdles remain that have prevented widespread adoption of the technology. Methods for preparing reagents used in cell-free experiments are often inconsistent, which can lead to irreproducible results. In addition, current methods do not produce batches of a sufficient volume of high quality reagent to enable widespread use. Furthermore, existing internal controls are insufficient for the complete characterization and validation of reagents, which makes instituting process controls difficult. The cell-free platform itself also requires improvement, as only relatively simple biological processes have been demonstrated and in only a handful of organismal environments.",487,3501,1,No,No,No,,"Develop an initial design and determine the technical feasibility of a technology platform for the consistent and large-scale production of cell-free reagents from multiple organisms, including methodologies for characterization and validation.

This topic seeks to integrate state-of-the-art electronics, packaging, and passivation technologies with the latest low-power data and power delivery semiconductor components in a single package. In other words, DARPA seeks to wirelessly bridge cortical neural activity sensing components within the skull to external computing and network systems, designing an effective ""Cortical Modem” that connects human brains to computer equipment and networks in a direct analogy to early telephonic modems, which connected computers to the ARPANET. DARPA is open to a multiplicity of system architectures that, first and foremost, demonstrate significant improvements in the scale of neural channel bandwidth from the current 100-signal demonstrations, but secondly, may span a wide spectrum of implementation strategies from high-bandwidth transmission systems with limited implantable computation capability, to implantable integrated analysis and compression systems coupled to a limited bandwidth telemetry systems. Significant advances in the miniaturization and ever lower-power performance of electronic and photonic technologies have enabled critical developments in miniaturized communications products like cellular phones. However, the time lag between such advances and their adoption in the fields of neuroscience and neuro-engineering has, in many cases, grown to more than twenty years. With such large interface component feature sizes characteristic of the older technologies in common experimental use, the supporting interface electronics have now become one of the most significant and fundamental limits to their integration within human and animal bodies. For example, the Utah array features a 400 micrometer electrode pitch, a limitation compounded by the wet etch microfabrication technology available to the manufacturer. Note that this 400 micron feature size is representative of 1980s CMOS technologies, and is too coarse for interfacing with, for example, the visual cortex where neural pitch ranges from ten to thirty microns. As the mobile computing industry continues to push miniaturization, functionality, and power-consumption requirements to their limits, so too is the field of neuroscience pushing ever closer to full-duplex single-neuron scale interfaces. With focused technology development and integration to build a Cortical Modem, the necessary critical electronics and packaging could be leveraged across the entire academic and corporate neuroscience ecosystem to result in dramatically accelerated advances in science and commercialization of neuroscience technologies. The goal of this topic is to develop cortical modem components that substantially improve the scale of signal transduction from the current 10x10 electronic probe arrays, as well as the scale of telemetry delivery of those signals., For reference purposes, one mm^3 volume of cortical tissue encloses approximately 100,000 neurons indicating an eventual need to both transduce and deliver wireless telemetry for as many as 10^7 independent neural channels. Proposals should target the design and implementation of a COTS-based full duplex cortical interface component. Essential elements of this component include flexible direct electronic interfaces to neural activity, sensors and low power pre-processing circuitry to convert and encode neural sensor signals into formats that can be transmitted wirelessly across the skull, wireless telemetry suitable for safe use in humans, and power delivery electronics. Packaging must leverage state-of-the-art miniaturized single system-on-a-chip ceramic packaging that incorporates on-board wireless power reception and conditioning circuitry. Critical to the design of the system is a careful power and link budget analysis to account for relevant FDA and FCC regulations. In addition, proposals should detail the intended components (i.e. make, model, and part numbers), their interface design, and the technical and mechanical specifications that will ultimately yield the lowest power, smallest form-factor, highest signal-to-noise ratio and bandwidth system possible using COTS components. Critical systems integration challenges must be addressed explicitly in the proposal. Technical challenges and considerations include system power, transmission bandwidth, frequency and data rates, transmission protocols, optical wavelengths, etc. Offerors are to first uncover and understand the critical integration challenges that may limit the translation and commercial-viability of full-duplex cortical interfaces, and second to push the standards of integration by producing a first generation of truly miniaturized and implantable interface componentry, thereby accelerating innovation across the entire field of neuro-engineering. Industrial and military collaborators should then produce products and reach their first commercialization milestones on a similarly accelerated timeline. Technical challenges may include: • The development of a standard interface between a multiplicity of different neural sensing components and the data collection and transmission system. • Maximizing the scalability and bandwidth-power product of both the internal neural sensing and external wireless data and power interfaces, but doing so within safe heat dissipation limits of the outer cortex and skull. • The potential need for data translation and encoding components to minimize power requirements for transcranial data and power delivery. • Establishing optimal trade-offs between physical, electronic, and data transmission specifications required to minimize the componentry bill of materials (BoM) and hence the size of the device that needs to be implanted. • Sourcing state-of-the-art packaging and system-on-a-chip prototyping support • Determining optimal bio-material passivation strategies and packaging materials limitations. • Determining optimal power-bandwidth tradeoffs and scalability to support increasing sensory density, resolution, and sensitivity limitations.",838,6181,1,No,No,No,,"Explore and determine the fundamental systems integration and packaging limitations (that are common across the entire neural interface field) in implementing a full-duplex read/write neural interface system that bridges data and power delivery across the human skull.

These demonstrations should be performed in relevant in vitro environments analogous to the final deployment environment in the human skull and cortex.","Development, demonstration, and delivery of a working fully-integrated cortical modem at a 1:1 physical scale with the underlying neurons. The Phase II demonstration should operate within a physical simulacrum that mimics as closely as possible the electrical and mechanical properties of human cortex, skull, and scalp. The integrated system should leverage COTS silicon and electro-optical devices wherever possible, and form a data and power bridge between the internal cortex and external machines. On the cortex side, a modular neural interface architecture should support bi-directional communications through a multiplicity of neural probe modalities, including, but not limited to, optical, electronic, and bio-molecular sensing interfaces. The external interface should be comprised of a wireless interconnection through intervening brain and skull tissue to external computing systems. Proposers are encouraged to adapt modular componentry strategies that are generalizable to a wide range of neural interfaces. The Cortical Modem system should be able to collect and transmit neural signals through the skull in a complete, implantable package. It will have a form-factor and packaging that can be implanted in the cortex with core system functionality provided by COTS semiconductor components in a single ceramic system-on-a-chip package, rather than a fully-customized chipset. The Phase II final report shall include (1) full system design and specifications detailing the electronics and proof-of-concept neural interfaces to be integrated; (2) expected performance specifications of the proposed components in vivo; and (3) calculations of energy and link budget scalability to larger cortical regions.","Breakthrough medical treatments for wounded warriors with multiple comorbidities of the sensory organs.

This topic seeks the demonstration of a portable broadband (1 GHz – 1 THz) electric field, power sensor, or key components towards a device. The sensor should be capable of operating in greater than 1 kV/m electric fields as to be usable for high-energy DoD applications. The electric field and power measurements must be SI traceable to remove the need for the recalibration process. Furthermore, the electric field-sensing device should be capable of sub-wavelength imaging of RF electric fields with spatial resolutions exceeding 10 µm. Many DoD and commercial applications critically rely on using calibrated electric field and power sensors in the RF, microwave, and millimeter-wavelength regimes. Currently no self-calibrated sensor exists in the 100 GHz – 1 THz frequency band. Typical detectors in the sub-THz frequency range are antennas which inherently perturb the field they are trying to sense, resulting in greater than 5% measurement errors. Antennas have the further limitation that they are narrow-band detectors. A SI-traceable sensor in the 1 GHz – 1 THz range would remove the need for costly recalibration of older devices and would replace many narrow-band antennas with a single low-SWaP device in a handheld package. Quantum sensors based upon Rydberg atoms offer the potential of traceable calibration, high sensitivity, wide spectral coverage, and high power capability. In addition to DoD applications, a Rydberg field and power sensor would have numerous commercial applications: circuit design [1, 2], biological sensing [3], aeronautics applications [4], and mobile communication [5]. This technology would not only verify circuit design but inform it by employing sub-wavelength RF field imaging of the complicated electronic fields from various dense circuits and metamaterials [1, 2]. Current technology employing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in Rydberg atoms in an atomic vapor cell is a promising route but requires further development in order to achieve DoD functionality. These devices function by converting an electric field amplitude into a measurable frequency splitting [6] that is SI-traceable [7]. The electric field magnitude E is given by |E|=??f/P, where ? is Planck’s constant divided by 2p, ?f is the measured frequency splitting, and P is the transition dipole moment. Current work has demonstrated sensitivities of 3 µV/sqrt(Hz) measuring electric fields as low as 7.3 µV/cm [8] and up to 40 V/m [9] in a 1-130 GHz frequency range. These results are the first calibrated field measurements in the 100 GHz – 1 THz frequency band to date. Employing this technique to image RF electric fields resulted in sub-100 µm spatial resolutions [1] for electric fields with frequencies up to 104 GHz [2, 10]. The fabrication of micrometer-sized vapor cells is one of the more challenging technological developments necessary for these sensors. The size of these vapor cells must be reduced to at least one quarter of the length of the minimum wavelength of interest in order to prevent variations in the measured RF fields produced by standing waves. These cells must be all dielectric, made of quartz or Pyrex for example, and must be filled with alkali atoms such as Rb and Cs or a mixture of atomic species. The fabrication of micrometer-sized vapor cells suffers from atomic adsorption to the cell walls. These vapor cells must employ a mitigation technique for the reduced vapor pressure such as novel coatings or materials, bonded infrared absorption glass to the outside of the cell for IR heating or optical coupling mirrors bonded to the cell to form optical resonators for enhanced atom-light interaction. Such vapor cell production would not only benefit electric field sensing but atomic vapor-based magnetometry. Atomic vapor magnetometry currently provides the most sensitive magnetic field measurements [11] but it does not have high spatial resolution because it is limited to integration over the vapor cell length. Commercially available micrometer-sized atomic vapor cells would allow for the extension of atom-based magnetometry into a different spatial resolution regime [12, 13].",669,4340,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate the operation of key components towards the electric field or power sensor in a laboratory setting such as: broadband measurements (100-250 GHz), electric field sensitivities better than 100 µV/cm, circuitry imaging with better than 50 µm spatial resolution, or fabrication of an alkali vapor cell with sub-mm length scales, and the development of a technique to mitigate reduced vapor pressures.

The Facebook graph today has over 1 Trillion edges. A single iteration of a graph traversal takes up to 3 minutes using Apache Giraph on 200 commodity CPU servers. A full breadth first traversal of the graph could take nearly 20 minutes, and algorithms that relax to a solution can require 50-100 iterations, implying that it could take several hours to compute the Page Rank of the Facebook graph. Bringing analytics within these graph programming frameworks into real-time on large graphs requires that they be able to leverage the computing advances in multi-core platforms. However, scalable, data-parallel graph analytics on many-core hardware is a fundamentally hard problem that goes well beyond the current state of the art. Graph data models and algorithms are used for network structured data, when the data are poorly structured, or when complex relationships must be drawn from multiple data sets and analyzed together. Graph operations are inherently non-local and, for many real-world data sets, that non-locality is aggravated by extreme data skew. Graph analytics are data intensive rather than compute intensive which means that memory and network bandwidth are the bottlenecks for graph processing. Overall, current solutions applied to scaling graph frameworks such as Tinkerpop and Graphlab do not have all of the desired attributes integrated, specifically 1) Solutions based on map/reduce or requiring checkpoints to disk are 1000s of times too slow to extract the value latent in graphs for time-sensitive analytics. (2) Solutions based on non-updatable data representations are limited in their application to complex analytics. 3) Solutions that provide robust scaling and high performance require specialized programming techniques that are not easily accessible to the existing graph development community. Approaches leveraging multi-core technology have significant promise. At the purely hardware level, GPU memory bandwidth is set to jump by 4x by Q1 2016 (Pascal). This should provide a 4x speedup.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I,"There is a critical DoD need for capabilities that focus on temperature stabilization of MEMS inertial sensors to improve bias and scale factor stability. Military operations rely on satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS) for precision Positioning, Navigation & Timing (PNT) information. However, GPS is an extremely small signal, which may be degraded due to signal interference or obstructed by environmental factors such as clouds, urban canyons or other impeding structures [1]. In GPS-degraded environments critical PNT information must be gathered from alternate sources, such as navigation by the technique of dead reckoning based on acceleration and rotation inputs from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) [2]. IMUs based on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are low Cost, Size, Weight, and Power (CSWaP), but typically exhibit high calibration environmental sensitivity, particularly to external temperature variation [3,4]. MEMS sensors are early in their development; they have made their way into consumer market but underlying limits to sensitivity and stability are not well understood. This is analogous to the development of crystal oscillators (XO) developed early in the 20th century. Over the past century, temperature sensitivity of crystal oscillators has been improved by applying temperature compensation algorithms based on the externally sensed ambient temperature (TCXO) [5]. However, the best performing crystal oscillators rely on ovenization of the resonant device to provide the highest stability (OCXO)[6]. The evolution of MEMS-based inertial sensors is likely to follow a similar trajectory due to the similarity of vibrating MEMS devices to quartz oscillators. At present, uncompensated MEMS inertial sensors are widely available for commercial applications and digital temperature compensation (TC-MEMS) devices are emerging [7]. Temperature stabilization has been demonstrated to improve long-term stability and reproducibility of MEMS inertial sensors in an academic setting but has yet to be transitioned into marketable MEMS-based inertial sensors [8].

Current DARPA programs are pursuing self-contained navigation for applications such as missile guidance, mounted and dismounted soldier navigation in GPS denied environments. Much progress has been made in existing microPNT programs. This SBIR will complement those efforts, by addressing the key driver of long-term instability with a fast track to commercialization. Due to the high performance of the OI-MEMS, there is limited commercial application.

Please see the DARPA 15.2 Direct to Phase II solicitation instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.","There is a compelling DoD need to create a low cost, compact and reconfigurable infrared imaging spectrometer that can operate in real time, and in a variety of backgrounds and ambient conditions. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems have been fielded for the detection of hazardous chemical and explosives threat materials, tag detection, friend vs. foe detection (IFF) and other defense critical sensing missions. Such systems currently exist in airborne and ground sensing configurations in short-wave, mid-wave and long-wave infrared (IR) spectral regions. They are based on HSI sensor hardware architectures combined with multivariate analysis algorithms [1,2]. While these imaging systems can provide sensitive and specific detections of targets and identification of materials in complex backgrounds, they are typically large, costly to field, operate, and support, and generally do not operate in real-time. Those systems that operate in real time typically compromise some degree of freedom, such as the number of spectral bands, image definition, or number of targets being detected. Reconfiguring the system to an alternative set of targets or backgrounds requires significant effort, which makes adjusting to dynamic mission conditions impractical. Nonetheless, intelligence based on HSI systems has proven very useful, resulting in an increasing demand for it; but due to the high cost of procuring and maintaining an HSI system, they are only available to privileged users. Specifically, what is needed is an IR hyperspectral imaging and sensing capability with the following characteristics: (1) rapidly field-configurable operation to adapt to different targets or operating conditions; (2) real-time, target on-the-move operation, ideally at the frame rate of the focal plane array camera; (3) real-time automated target signature detection, performed within the system to dramatically reduce data bandwidth, downlink transmission bandwidth requirements, and post-processing; (4) significantly reduced cost, size, and weight; and (5) imaging operation with minimal support infrastructure. The resulting system should be able to support one or more of the following missions: counter IED detection, IFF, bio/chemical WMD detection and tag, track and locate (TTL) missions. The performance goals of such a system are: • Frame rate 10 frame per second (fps) or greater • Free spectral range covering at least one band of 850-1700 nm for SWIR, 3-5µm for MWIR, 8-11+µm for LWIR • Form factor, suitable for operation as a handheld, wearable or UAV-mounted configuration • Weight less than 5 lbs. • Run time greater than 4 hours, with power source included in weight metric • Cost of less than $50,000 in volume of 1000 or more • High Definition Chemical Image - Megapixel (1Kx1K) or greater • Low latency of less than or equal to 100ms • Interface compatible with XML schema • Autonomously link to existing military architecture or infrastructure (e.g., cell phone). In summary, a Compact, Mission-Configurable, on-Demand, Real-Time, Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Sensor is envisioned. It is acknowledged that all spectral ranges may not be accommodated in a single sensor, and that the objective vision may not be fully realizable during the course of a Phase II SBIR. However, concrete and compelling hardware/software progress towards this vision is expected to be demonstrated.",508,3392,1,No,No,No,,"Design a concept for an infrared hyperspectral imaging system capable of real-time, and multi-mission configurable-on-demand operation with specific performance objectives as described.

Driving the SWaP and cost down such that the system can be used by a dismount or on a small UAV will enable proliferation of the capability in the same way that night vision goggles or cell phones have become an integral part of the soldier’s arsenal. Requiring the system to be compatible with existing systems and data formats will help ensure more rapid acceptance and use. Commercial application of hyperspectral imaging has been increasing in parallel to military applications. These include agriculture, mining, medical imaging and diagnoses, environmental management, disaster management and hazard assessment. Like military applications, the cost and size of these systems limits their availability to all but the most privileged users. Driving the system cost and SWaP down would enable proliferation of these devices to a potentially large user base, including municipalities (police, fire, etc.), agriculture (farmers, land managers, etc.), and healthcare (health screening and microbiology).",1,"National Research Council.

This topic seeks innovative solutions for arrays of acoustic pressure and vector sensors. ""Fiber optic” array technology is maturing rapidly, but has suffered from poor mechanical reliability, relatively high power consumption not suitable for long-life battery operated systems and high sensor self­noise. Optical acoustic pressure and vector sensors are a primary technology that may provide improved array performance in a relatively compact design. A design approach based on optical sensor interrogation and telemetry is preferred due to the intrinsic cost, size, weight, and power advantages of this technology. All required components of the array should be addressed (sensor, interconnect, interrogation system, processing, power). The acoustic band of interest is 15,000 Hertz and below, and the primary interest is in acoustic frequencies of 1000 Hz and below. An important objective is to develop a low cost, size, weight and power (CSWAP) interrogation/telemetry capability for the sensor array design, so that the total self­noise is significantly below ambient noise. In the deep ocean, ambient acoustic noise can be much lower at depth, therefore the acoustic performance threshold for self­noise from optical sensors and electronic sensor components to be 20 dB//re 1 µPa2/Hz below Sea State 0 and low shipping noise levels, with an objective of 30 dB//re 1 µPa2/Hz below Sea State 0.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I.","There is a compelling DoD need to leverage emerging commercial entrepreneurial and defense technologies enabling lightweight, high-specific-energy liquid-rocket technology. Many established aerospace and emerging entrepreneurial companies are developing new rocket stage technologies that promise to reduce the cost of access to space. The goal of this topic is to leverage these investments to enable low-cost launch vehicles that minimize gross and dry weight while maximizing the propellant load, engine specific impulse and/or payload. Technological trends facilitating such lightweight stages include an ongoing computer/software revolution enabling affordable design, sophisticated software in lieu of mechanical complexity, integration, and test; micro-miniaturization of electronics and mechanical actuators; high strength-to-weight composites and nano-engineered materials; lightweight structural concepts and thermal protection; advanced manufacturing methods, high thrust/weight rocket engines and turbo-machinery; and novel high-density-impulse liquid propellants that are safe, cheap and easy to handle. The offeror must demonstrate a clear understanding of the system applications of the launch vehicle and the supporting technologies. A system application of interest to the government is modifying the launch vehicle as a low-cost upper stage for DARPA’s Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program. Key design goals include balancing low gross mass with adequate velocity change, payload and manufacturing cost. Additionally, reusable launch concepts such as XS-1 may carry stages through either normal or longitudinally-oriented hardpoints/racks. Stages with efficient structural arrangements to cope with such load paths while remaining low in mass and cost are of interest. Other potential system applications include a wide range of commercial launch vehicles, tactical missiles, satellite integral propulsion and future boost-glide tactical or air transport systems. Similarly, a clear understanding of the technology applications to XS-1 as well as other proposed military and commercial systems is also essential. Critical technologies could include lightweight structures and propulsion, high-density-impulse propellants, miniaturized avionics, modular components, altitude compensation and complementary aerodynamic/propulsion integration, and stability, guidance and control subsystems all integrated into the stage while keeping the system simple and affordable. Offerors may seek to design and fabricate an entire stage or only critical subsystems.",332,2572,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the design, manufacturing and test approach for fabricating extremely low-cost, high propellant mass fraction launch vehicles and upper stages for space access.

Regulation of neural and other biological functions via interface technologies has become increasingly enticing as a means of clinical treatment [1]. For instance, over the past several decades we have seen the emergence of neural recording and stimulation to restore sensorimotor capability and vagal nerve stimulation technologies for the treatment of epilepsy and depression. While these treatments have achieved moderate success, existing clinically approved technologies offer limited stability and precision, which significantly hinders their clinical translation. Despite recent noteworthy advancements in pre-clinical electrode technologies, existing devices suffer from reliability problems, often associated with tissue damage and/or mechanical failure of the device [2]. Even state-of-the-art interface technologies exert high mechanical strain on surrounding tissues, leading to scarring, persistent bleeding and neuronal damage. Tissue in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) has Young’s Modulus of approximately 600 kPa. Traditional electrodes are manufactured using either fine metal wires, such as platinum (168 GPa), or microfabricated from silicon (180 GPa). This six order of magnitude difference in stiffness leads to a number of issues—including tissue damage, surgical attachment and relative motion—which reduce the clinical viability of these technologies. By developing bio-interfaces with kPa-scale stiffness, it would be possible to attach neuromodulation devices to the PNS without incurring these problems. Proposed implantable neural interface devices should be able to penetrate the tough epineurium of a specified nerve (e.g. vagus, ulnar), enter multiple fascicles and accommodate the range of motion that the nerve typically encounters. Wearable technologies should similarly match the mechanical properties of skin and tissue to provide robust, biocompatible solutions for biological interfacing. This topic seeks to advance the clinical readiness of bio-interface technologies by decreasing the biomechanical mismatch between manufactured devices and biological tissue. The most established approaches in this space use polymeric substrates with embedded conductors [3]. There have been recent advances in materials that may push the Young’s Modulus down even further, such as shape memory polymers that soften when inserted into tissue [4]. While these advances are important, all still use substrate materials that have a modulus greater than 10 MPa. Some early demonstrations of biologic materials such as collagen [5] have yielded crude but functional devices with kPa-scale stiffness properties. Dissolvable carrier substrates [6] have also shown promising results, but depend heavily upon the dissolution rate of the sacrificial material and leave behind tiny but stiff electrodes. Despite these advances in materials science and device fabrication, there has been little progress towards demonstration of functional devices, much less mechanical testing with ex vivo nerve tissue or in vivo electrophysiological validation. Without this validation, promising new technologies will not be adopted by the neural interface community or medical device manufacturers.",470,3439,1,No,No,No,,"Proposals to this topic should aim to develop and/or demonstrate mechanically compliant yet reliable biological interface devices that are wearable or implantable, enabling direct monitoring or modulation of biological signals in peripheral nerves and organs. Implantable PNS-specific devices should demonstrate an ability to penetrate the epineurium and perineurium of a nerve to insert kPa-scale electrodes into individual fascicles, and to do so at a scale and precision relevant to neuromodulation therapies. These devices should include interconnects to mate with standard benchtop or implantable electrophysiology equipment. Wearable devices should provide reliable measurement of biological signals that are relevant to quantifying health physiology. Phase I deliverables include: Proof of concept demonstrating the feasibility of manufacturing and implementing novel soft bio-interface devices. Feasibility may be demonstrated through a variety of models, including tissue phantoms, in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo studies. The final report must include a quantitative analysis of interface properties and mechanical characteristics. The final report should also contain detailed plans for Phase II.","Work in this SBIR topic should focus upon creating fully functioning interface devices suitable for chronic implantation in vivo. Performers should develop manufacturing and testing procedures to produce and verify the flexible bio-interface assembly. Devices should comprise a set of interconnects, flexible tethering leads and a compliant substrate containing a multitude of interface sites for stimulating and/or sensing neural activity (at fascicular resolution or better) or measuring biomolecules in vivo. The interface assemblies must be safe, effective and chronically stable for long-term use in animals or humans. Phase II deliverables include: Demonstrate the reliability and scalability of the manufacturing approach. Proposals should include plans to develop and demonstrate individual compliant devices using batch manufacturing process flows capable of producing hundreds of identical devices. Studies should characterize the morphological and physiological properties of relevant tissue to develop advanced finite element models and validate these against ex vivo experiments with the soft interface technology. Phase II efforts must also demonstrate the lifetime of the devices through Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), including mechanical, soak and electrical testing. Finally, the devices must be tested chronically in animal models to validate sensing and modulation capability, as well as cross-talk, impedance and other relevant properties. Tissue samples must undergo histological examination to demonstrate the extent of damage incurred during application or surgical insertion as well as after chronic use. Direct to Phase II: Existing technologies that target peripheral nerves and have demonstrated capabilities are eligible for Direct to Phase II applications.","Highly effective clinical therapies for treating disease and mental health through biocompatible neuromodulation devices.

The MWIR and LWIR spectral regions are technologically important for numerous applications including communications, environmental and industrial monitoring, thermal imaging, and chemical sensing for defense and homeland security [1]. Despite the pressing physical motivations for extending such applications to the MWIR and LWIR, the lack of suitable radiation sources and detectors in these spectral regions has resulted in applications being developed in the less favorable, near-infrared (NIR) spectral region where the telecom industry has driven the development of laser and detector technologies. The maturation of quantum cascade laser technology and the recent development of microresonator-based optical frequency comb technology [2] have changed the current and future MWIR/LWIR landscape. To fully exploit the application potential [3] of chip-scale optical frequency comb sources now under development, new high-speed, broad spectral coverage, and highly sensitive detectors are needed to replace the often bulky, cryo-cooled systems that are currently in use.",168,1220,1,No,No,No,,"Design a photodetector with <1 pW/Hz^1/2 noise equivalent power (NEP) for operation in the MWIR (3-6 microns) and/or LWIR (6-15 microns) spectral regions.

The evaluation of cyber defensive security mechanisms is difficult and ad hoc. To compare the efficacy of different techniques, tools and technologies, analysts typically rely on synthetic benchmarks that either present a sample of existing vulnerabilities [1] or a potpourri of synthetic test cases [2]. Given the limited availability of such benchmarks, cyber security mechanisms tune their techniques to ensure success (high precision and recall). Ideally, evaluation should rely on automated mechanisms that can systematically inject realistic vulnerabilities into arbitrary software programs with enough understanding of the underlying computation to guide the evaluation of a wide range of security mechanisms (e.g., dynamic verses static analysis techniques). To achieve such program understanding, a combination of techniques may be necessary. For example, targeted symbolic execution [3] may be used to discover program paths that could be used to generate vulnerabilities (e.g., integer overflows). The programs paths (i.e., symbolic constraints) could then be modified using information from formal methods (e.g., using SMT solvers) to generate and inject new code, at the source-level or binary-level, that is provably vulnerable (e.g., the system can prove that the generated conditions along a specific program path can lead to an integer overflow).

A conformal, thin, broadband and rapid steering beam steering device would overcome the usual, disadvantages of traditional optical systems and electro-optical devices beam steering devices, which use heavy and power-hungry gimbals and optical components making large mechanical motions. Non-mechanical optical beam steering devices have been demonstrated. Most use electrically- controlled optical diffraction to steer the optical beam. These devices operate over a narrow wavelength band, since the diffraction-induced steering angle depends sensitively on the wavelength of light. These narrowband devices are not suitable for broadband optical applications. Most passive electro-optic (EO) systems are broadband. Also there are laser systems, such as femto-second pulsed lasers and supercontinium lasers that are broadband and will allow broadband light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems. Providing broadband beam steering for lidar and passive EO systems could enable new LIDAR capabilities using these super continuum lasers, and new passive EO systems capability. As a baseline this effort will require operation in either the near IR wavelength region or the mid IR wavelength region. The proposed effort should discuss extending this capability to the visible and to either the NIR region or MWIR region, which ever band is not covered by the baseline approach. Threshold performance objectives are a 10 cm diameter aperture, a 60 degree field of steering in both angular dimensions, > 75% optical transmission efficiency , broadband operation over at least 10 percent bandwidth, beam quality no worse than 3 times diffraction limit, and < 1 msec beam steering time. It is desire able to exceed these goals if possible. It is desirable to keep physical size small, with the beam steerer no deeper than the diameter of the clear aperture beam steering device. A key aspect of the approach is that the beam steering concept must be compatible with conformal windows on aircraft (i.e. windows that conform to the airframe surface). Beam steering approaches should be capable of operating bi-directionally, that is, as optical transmitters and receivers.",344,2294,1,No,No,No,,"Determine feasibility of possible EO beam steering approaches and evaluate their performance.

In Phase II, a Phase I concept will be reduced to practice and performance validated in a laboratory setting. The experiments conducted should result in empirical and/or analytic knowledge that will be used in the preliminary prototype design effort. The laboratory brassboard may not directly meet the desired threshold objectives, but should at a minimum provide characterization data and demonstrate by analysis that the performance objectives can be met. The preliminary design should focus on a demonstration system which could be utilized in a field experiment and would directly meet the performance objectives. Phase II deliverables include: (1) laboratory brassboard design, (2) report of brassboard experiment results, (3) preliminary design package for field test device.","A Phase III system could be applied to a number of commercial applications, including: 1) LIDAR measurements of wind velocities, aerosol characterization, and terrain mapping, 2) compact surveillance systems in security applications. A commercially focused Phase III effort would choose a viable commercial use and build a prototype system optimized for that application. The DoD currently uses a large number of broadband EO systems, and active EO systems (e.g. LIDAR) are increasingly of interest as well. The use of optical systems such as these is limited by the need for a turret to house the beam director. This protrusion causes aerodynamic drag that limits range and speed of the platform. Additionally, the wake turbulence can limit the useful speed and field­of­regard regime of the sensor systems. A Phase III effort would focus on increasing the TRL level of the technology to a point that is compatible with an airborne demonstration on a relevant military air platform. The effort would include any necessary component technology development, but primarily be a detailed design, integration and test phase. Phase III would include a final test and evaluation of the beam steerer with both an active EO system and a broadband passive EO sensor.",1,"PF McManamon, PJ Bos, MJ Escuti, J Heikenfeld, S Serati, H Xie, EA Watson, “A review of phased array steering for narrow-band electro-optical systems”, Proceedings of the IEEE 97 (6), 1078-1096; P.

Improve target angle rate error. Improve performance of aperture-limited antennas. Demonstrate breadboard-level seeker functionality.,"The DARPA MAD-FIRES program seeks to use a medium-caliber guided projectile to engage maneuvering threats. Current projectile technologies have been demonstrated in flight maneuver, but only recently have advances in electronics and gun survivability opened the possibility of projectile-based seekers. One possible seeker type is RF seekers. Current RF systems require apertures larger than projectile diameter for target tracking in terminal engagement. A novel approach is needed for achieving sufficient gain at small diameter to enable medium-caliber RF seekers. The alternative solution of command-guidance from ground radar places significant accuracy requirements on that radar, which becomes prohibitive for very long-range acquisitions. Optical sensors offer high accuracy, but are limited in range and require hot targets or daylight illumination. RF seekers are the primary candidate for maturation. DARPA seeks a novel antenna and seeker approach that will allow successful antenna integration on a medium-caliber projectile. The antennas must reside within the outer mold line of a medium-caliber projectile and survive gun launch and ballistic fly out. The antenna should provide sufficient gain in the forward direction to track targets during fly out and terminal engagement. The antennas must support accurate measurement of line of sight to target for terminal phase guidance.

This technology provides design flexibility to all size constrained systems such as UAVs and satellites. The ability to position antennas longitudinally (lengthwise) while achieving the same performance as a traditional front facing antenna provides many more options for antenna placement and orientation to optimize overall miniaturization and compact system design.

Whole genome engineering—for example, bacteria or yeast with extensively re-engineered genomes—offers exciting new possibilities for efficient biological manufacturing platforms and accelerated processes for optimizing engineered metabolic pathways.[1] However, current approaches to genome engineering fall short of this vision, with a state-of-the-art development cycle that remains prohibitively costly, time-consuming, and laborious. Examples include the first fully synthetic functional genome, based on a simple bacteria with a small genome (1.08 Mbp) that nevertheless required approximately 15 years and $40 million to develop, as well as the first synthetic yeast chromosome, chromosome III of S. cerevisiae, which included only approximately 2.5% of the entire genome and required 5 years.[2] Additionally, few tools are available for genome engineering of species beyond these and other common model organisms, such as E. coli, B. subtilis, and S. pombe. A critical challenge to advancing towards whole genome engineering is the ability to assemble and transfer large DNA constructs, which has not kept pace with rapid improvements in DNA synthesis technology. The commercial price for microgram-scale synthesis of large (for example, 4 kbp to 10 kbp) error-free DNA constructs is now less than $0.22 per base pair with a turnaround time of less than 1 month,[3] and larger constructs may then be assembled from these DNA synthesis building blocks. However, as the availability, size, and sequence complexity of synthetic DNA constructs increase, so too do the technical challenges associated with handling and transfer into cells. For example, the simple act of pipetting can lead to truncated and/or recombined DNA products due to shear, which synthetic DNA affected significantly more than natively supercoiled chromatin. Increased size and linear topology also reduce DNA uptake into cells, such that successful transfers of large, functional, synthetic DNA constructs are extremely rare even in the most competent cells. With significant DNA fragmentation, failure rates for assembly can be substantial, and longer, more complex DNA sequences inherently require greater effort for validation. These and other limitations have left little room practically for the extensive pathway changes and rational genome engineering promised by synthetic biology. This solicitation is focused on the development of a novel platform for DNA assembly, transfer, and transfection. DNA constructs will be assembled from synthesized DNA building blocks (for example, approximately 10 kbp to 20 kbp) manufactured at common commercial scales (for example, approximately 1 µg) with acceptably low error rates. Assemblies directed towards prokaryotes must be at least 50 kbp, while assemblies directed towards eukaryotes must be at least 100 kbp. DNA transfection efficiency is generally measured using two scales, namely the number of cells transfected per µg of DNA and the overall percentage of cells transfected. The final percentage of successfully transfected cells must be greater than 1% to facilitate downstream identification and characterization by end users. While necessary enrichment steps are not prohibited, increasing the apparent DNA transfer efficiency by flow cytometry sorting or extensive screening methods will be considered nonresponsive. The delivered platform should be applicable broadly, meeting suitable performance metrics in at least three phylogenetically dissimilar species. The demonstration of general methods to efficiently synthesize, assemble, and transfer functioning DNA into a broad range of organisms would represent a significant technological leap forward, opening new paths towards biotechnological solutions to problems of vital national importance.

While both of these approaches are relatively non-destructive and can produce an accurate diagnosis, they require a significant amount of training, expert knowledge and equipment to operate. In addition, due to the surgical nature of these procedures, they carry a small but not insignificant risk of infection and hemorrhage. Under battlefield conditions, combat medics do not have the time, hand-held equipment or antiseptic environment required to quickly and accurately identify a wounded service member’s condition using these techniques. For example, the majority of potentially survivable combat deaths occur due to inadequate hemorrhage control.

Consequently, ensuring that programs are correct, especially at scale, remains a difficult and challenging endeavor. Poorly designed or incorrectly implemented software can lead to unwitting ingestion of malware that can result in potentially crippling security violations, which can in turn have profound negative consequences on the reliability of mission-critical systems, and the correct operation of important and sensitive cyber-infrastructure. Identifying flawed software structure necessary for malware infiltration is critical to ensuring the trustworthiness of modern-day DoD software systems. Trying to ascertain whether a given piece of software contains vulnerabilities that make it an attractive malware target is problematic in isolation, however, given the large number of malware variants, and the well-known limitations of static and dynamic program analyses, with respect to their high false negative and false positive rates, resp. Indeed, security specialists AV-Test [1] recently reported that new malware was up 72 percent in 2014 from the previous year, despite tremendous investment in software security, suggesting that it is easy to create and sustain diverse malware variants resistant to existing analysis and patching techniques. Rather than examining a single program in isolation, we posit that a potentially more fruitful approach would be to leverage the results of mining a large corpus of programs for common semantic patterns that can be used to assess the trustworthiness of software components. Limitations in existing analysis techniques can be thus mitigated using statistical methods and machine learning approaches, i.e., ""Big Code”. To explore this thesis in the context of automated repair and program synthesis, DARPA’s Mining and Understanding Software Enclaves (MUSE) program [2] has already produced a large publically available corpus of open source software, currently containing over 200K projects, reflecting over 600GBs of source code. By extending and labeling this corpus with known malware (source and binary) artifacts, along with a precise representation of their attack vectors, we envision the construction of an evolving semantic database that effectively relates these artifacts with potentially vulnerable software components. New programs can now be compared against these components to gauge the likelihood they are vulnerable to a specific malware attack.",368,2581,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a plan for creating tools and techniques that leverage Big Code to create trustworthy software systems.

Emerging applications require highly sensitive detection of magnetic fields in non-laboratory environments. As many of these applications require cancelling of the background field in order to isolate the signal of interest, it is expected that significant application gain will be realized through gradient detection.

Link range losses can be partially overcome by reducing data rates, but useful links need to have capacities of 100s of bits per second to 10,000s of bits per second. Approaches using relays (surface, satellite, and airborne) have drawbacks related to deployment logistics, force protection, and covertness. What is needed are new radio technologies to extend RF link ranges in a maritime environment, including novel combinations of antennas, wide tuning range front-ends, signal processing, inter-platform coordination, and other techniques as required. The radio system packaging would support multiple platforms such as autonomous vehicles as well as manned aircraft and surface ships. Power, antenna size, and weight consistent with small unmanned vehicles in maritime scenarios are important factors. Link range predictability is also important. It is likely that this new technology may often be unable to meet the required link ranges over some time periods. Being able to predict at the network level what connections are possible ahead of time is critical because it enables assets to coordinate their activities ahead of time to make use of communications when available (i.e. when the UUV is submerged).

These sorts of systems would combine long-lived structural and support infrastructure components with shorter-lived, higher-value electronics and payloads. Regular replacement of payloads would allow space systems to take advantage of technological improvements as soon as they are available, similarly to ground-based systems. The envisioned platform would enable payload owners to send just payloads—and not all the equipment to support them—that could be delivered and assembled onto the platform as needed. Such a capability could enable a new market approach to leasing support infrastructure on orbit, which could help multiple commercial and government organizations place payloads over specific geographic locations. This scenario would allow system costs to be amortized across multiple customers over many years.",150,1070,1,No,No,No,,"• Determine the technical feasibility of the persistent platform in GEO, the key enabling technologies or processes, and the technology limitations to be overcome. • Determine potential payloads to be integrated to the persistent platform. • Define system and requirements design for the persistent platform in GEO, including services provided to payloads and interface requirements (hardware and software) between the platform and the payloads. • Develop analysis and mitigation strategies to ensure each payload’s specific mission needs are met (e.g. If multiple payloads require precise pointing, how could pointing services be provided to each payload as needed?) • Phase 1 deliverables will include a final report with the details described in this solicitation. For launch, delivery and ejection into GEO, the platform (or atomic units that could be assembled into a platform) should be able to fit within the size, weight and power constraints of the DARPA Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system (standard or extended size). Mass allocation for a standard POD is up to 90 kg; mass allocation for an extended POD is up to 150 kg. Standard POD volume allocation is 1m by 0.5m by 0.4m. Extended POD volume allocation is 1m by 1m by 0.6m. Power available for a POD from its host spacecraft during launch and orbit raising is 150W average, 300W peak at 28-31V. (After ejection, this power would no longer be available and the platform would need to collect and distribute its own power.) Proposers should assume the existence of a robotic or other system in orbit and available to effect the integration of newly launched payloads to the persistent platform.","• Continue to develop a system design for the persistent platform, with a preliminary design review (PDR)-level design to be delivered by the end of Phase 2. • Provide a practical implementation for requirements developed in Phase 1. • Construct and demonstrate the operation of a prototype of enabling hardware (and any enabling software). • Validate key performance parameters for the prototype. Phase 2 would entail a prototype delivery of any enabling mechanism, structure or other hardware for the concept developed in Phase 1.","DARPA’s Payload Orbital Delivery (POD) system is scheduled for testing in orbit in 2017. If successful and adopted by the space community, PODs could provide opportunities for rideshare and ejection from a host spacecraft in GEO between six and eight times per year. A Phase 3 application for this enabling technology for the persistent platform would include the development, integration, test and delivery to orbit of the flight platform developed under this SBIR topic. Because the robotic or other system required to integrate newly launched payloads to this platform might lag behind the launch of the platform or platform unit itself, the first demonstration of the platform could be launched with one or two payloads to demonstrate feasibility of hosting and providing the required resources to multiple representative GEO payloads. The platform should include, however, some number of open interfaces to allow for the future integration of payloads as the on-orbit payload integrator becomes available. This demonstrator platform could be purely military or purely commercial, or the platform could host payloads for both military and commercial applications simultaneously. The latter path may prove difficult due to regulatory and policy issues related to differing spectrum allocation, information assurance requirements, mission prioritization, etc., but it would likely be the preferred instantiation for the persistent platform to host government, commercial and international payloads alike.",1,"On a robotic spacecraft servicing concept: Roesler, G., Sullivan, B.

The SBE sciences provide essential theories and frameworks that shape understanding of a wide range of human social behavior and systems of relevance for national security. The validity and reliability of SBE theories and concepts are fundamental to strong tactical, operational, strategic, and policy-level decision-making across the Department of Defense. In light of several widely recognized ""crises” in reproducibility in a number of disciplines, there is increased appreciation for the importance – and challenge – of experimentally validating results and claims of theories or model predictions. The academic community has responded by identifying a wide range of biases in the published literature, as well as their sources in experimental, statistical, and institutional structures and practices. Fortunately, a number of best practices and innovative methods have been developed to mitigate some of these challenges – but there remain opportunities for further development and dissemination of tools that, if matured and adopted, could have significant positive impact on a wide range of research questions and communities in SBE. Accordingly, this topic is soliciting proposals for innovative tools that could demonstrate this positive impact. Examples might include proposals that provide credible approaches to improve the speed, efficiency, cost and/or adoption of one or more of the following tools: methods for pre-registration of experimental protocols; tools for transparent, modular, dynamic, and portable informed consent; Bayesian Net tools for tracking contingent evidentiary support structures within complex data or experimental designs; statistical tools to help identify and mitigate different biases in published or unpublished research; meta-analytic tools for exploring the robustness and generalizability of empirical findings; extensible packages for the analysis of text or geocoded data; assimilation methods for tuning computational models using real-time observations; licensing models for ethical data-sharing that protects Personally Identifiable Information (PII); platforms for joint collaboration and design of experimental protocols to increase scientific value prior to data collection; methods to obtain institutional pre-approval of widely-used experimental platforms like online surveys or games; and platforms that ethically and cost-effectively recruit a large number of experimental subjects across a wide range of cultural and demographic variables. This topic is generally not seeking to fund approaches that are tightly tied to narrow experimental protocols or sensor systems, rely on restricted or excessively costly software and/or data sets, or visualization tools not explicitly tied to reproducible analytic techniques.

Please see the 16.2 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.2 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.","There is a critical DoD need to develop a secure messaging and transaction platform accessible via web browser or standalone native application. The platform separates the message creation, from the transfer of the message within a secure courier to the reception and decryption of the message. Legacy messaging and backoffice infrastructures, traditionally based on centralized, unencrypted hub-and spoke database architecture, are expensive, inefficient, brittle and subject to cyber attack. The overhead costs of maintaining such architectures is rising rapidly. Many organizations unknowingly keep duplicate information and fail to ensure synchronization thus amplifying the potential for data theft and data corruption/rot. Incorporating a truly transparent mechanism for conducting journaled transactions enables the DoD to leverage its distributed footprint for a reduction in latency of these transactions, their security and their integrity and assurance. The messaging platform will transfer messages via a secure decentralized protocol that will be secured across multiple channels, including but not limited to: 1) Transport protocol, 2) Encryption of messages via various application protocols, 3) Customized blockchain implementation of message deconstruction and reconstruction, and decentralized ledger implementation. With this messaging platform the business logic of the DoD ecosystem would be mapped onto a network of known entities using distributed ledgers. By doing this significant portions of the DoD backoffice infrastructure can be decentralized, ‘smart documents and contracts’ can be instantly and securely sent and received thereby reducing exposure to hackers and reducing needless delays in DoD backoffice correspondance. As an example, Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPR) could be implmented using the secure ledger. Regulators with access to the ledger could read the correspondance and thus easily verify that a MIPR transaction didn’t violate Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The messaging platform would act as the transport for a cyptographically sound record of all transactions whether they be MIPRs, contracts, troop movements or intelligence. Troops on the ground in denied communications environments would have a way to securely communicate back to HQ and DoD back office executives could rest assured that their logistics system is efficient, timely and safe from hackers. The benefits are broad and could even be applied to domains such as space. With crowded skies it’s important to maintain situational awareness of all satellites and those concerned with space situational awareness/telemetry or air traffic control could instantly share data between nations using a separate but equivalent ledger implementation thus removing questions as to the authenticity and integrity of the data.",403,2857,1,No,No,No,,"Create a specific decentralized messaging platform built on the framework of an existing blockchain framework. There are several layers of complexity that will be explored in this phase from the messaging platform, to transport protocol, to end user application. Phase 1 goals include: creating a model for the decentralized messaging platform, experimenting with encryption schemes, evaluating hardware to be used in combination with the messaging platform to provide additional security, and defining the product feature set from the application and platform perspectives and finally, developing a blueprint of the platform architecture mapped to DoD constructs.","Develop, test and evaluate a working prototype with the following features: • Decentralized back end blockchain implementation • Data aggregation, reconstruction • Data transport protocol implementation • End user application implementation (alpha) • Conduct simulated MIPR transactions using the decentralized ledger • Allow transparent regulatory review of DoD legal findings and contracts • Significant reduction in time for regulatory overview of various transactions • Tracking of aircraft or satellites with simulated telemetry or air traffic control data • System Admin and Monitoring tools and engine • Integration of hardware or edge of network hardware components","The DoD requires a secure messaging system that can provide repudiation or deniability, perfect forward and backward secrecy, time to live/self delete for messages, one time eyes only messages, a decentralized infrastructure to be resilient to cyber-attacks, and ease of use for individuals in less than ideal situations. Based on the outcomes and feedback from Phase 2, Phase 3 will focus on commercialization and full-scale implementation of the platform. This entails converting the alpha of the end user application into a beta application and increasing user testing and platform monitoring and industrializing the back-end platform in terms of decentralized ledger architecture and blockchain implementation.",1,SoK: Secure Messaging http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2015/cacr2015-02.pdf; Hyperledger Project https://www.hyperledger.org/,SoK: Secure Messaging http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2015/cacr2015-02.pdf; Hyperledger Project https://www.hyperledger.org/,2,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/80389/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/80389/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,16.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:18:38,,,,,SB162-004_80389,DOD_SBIR_16_P1_C2_SB162-004,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:01.57866+00

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 16.2 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.2 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.,"Modern warfare requires reacting to ever-greater numbers of autonomous systems, not only in the form of vehicles, but also as agents working in cyber defense [1,2] and in social media [3,4]. As a result, there is a critical DoD need for the development of control strategies for groups of autonomous agents (""swarms""), in particular, strategies that would allow for resilient performance when interacting with other (friendly, neutral, or hostile) swarms employing their own, potentially unknown, strategies. Such interactions can lead directly to unexpected and potentially adverse emergent behaviors. The U.S. stock market ""flash crash” of 2010 [5,6] is one example of adverse emergent behavior resulting from, in part, the interaction of autonomous agents with proprietary and largely unobservable internal workings. In future joint operations, coordination of swarms will become a strict requirement to prevent unwanted emergent behavior. Similarly, managing interactions with neutral and adversarial autonomous agents in ""gray zone” [7] and major combat operations will be essential. In all cases, the autonomous agents may be required to function and coordinate/manage interactions under a large variety of conditions without a robust model of their interacting partner or adversary systems. This lack of models makes the common modeling- and simulation-based approach to the design of autonomous system control strategies [8] less effective. An alternative approach is to focus on developing novel control strategies based on advanced meta-heuristic algorithms [9] that provide the necessary resilience to interactions with other systems. Research into the social behavior of species such as wasps, ants, and bees [10-12] (as well as the collective behavior of cells [13], such as bacteria, yeast, and amoebae) has the potential to help identify useful such meta-heuristic control strategies, as they (a) exhibit strong parallels to autonomous agents, with processing and action at both individual and group levels [10], (b) necessarily and routinely engage in interactions within colonies, across colonies, across species, and across varied environments, and (c) have evolved highly resilient policies governing a number of forms of synchronized and coordinated behavior. The study of biological systems and their control strategies—which have evolved over millions of years to provide resilience in the face of a wide array of challenges—has already contributed significantly to computer science [14–17] and autonomous systems research [18–20]. Furthermore, research on non-vertebrate species can typically be done rapidly and at low cost, with established rigorous experimental practices for investigating specific classes of interactions. These biological systems therefore represent a vast natural library of meta-heuristic algorithms that could be used in the design of control strategies, and, in addition, can serve an experimental platform for investigating specific classes of interactions. The focus of this work will be on leveraging research in biological systems to identify strategies and develop algorithms for coping with emergent behavior in shared environments with both competitive and non-competitive autonomous systems. Domains of interest include, but are not limited to: cyber defense, social media, data-mining, unmanned vehicles, and complex system design (see, e.g., [21]).",488,3407,1,No,No,No,,"Define one or more compelling problem domains related to national security where swarms of autonomous agents interact in shared environments. Identify one or more non-vertebrate species (not subject to animal use guidelines) that can provide insights into the control of autonomous agents and provide detailed rationale for their selection. Develop experimental design for biological system study and conduct a pilot study. Prototype a software framework for testing, in simulation, algorithms embodying new meta-heuristic control strategies. Develop and demonstrate simple algorithms based on the result of the pilot study and/or prior research data, explicitly show the biological system basis for the strategies, and compare performance to existing algorithms. The Phase I final report will include an experimental plan to be executed under Phase II.","Execute the experimental plan developed under Phase I to study the most informative forms of interaction in the chosen species.

Evaluate algorithms against existing state of the art, and demonstrate the biological system basis for the strategies. Identify target autonomous systems that could adopt resulting algorithms. Deliverables will include software (source code) and technical reports, and the Phase II final report with recommendations for transitioning the algorithms to operational systems.","The DoD has considerable interest in ensuring successful interoperation of autonomous systems (and systems of such systems) in joint operations with partner nations. Therefore, the goal during Phase III will be on transitioning algorithms to specific platforms and their respective programs of record, as well as transitioning the software framework for testing control strategies for use in laboratory environments. This will entail development of application-specific software, hardening the algorithms, and ensuring performance on application-specific hardware as well as in real-world and real-time environments.",1,"Kirilenko, A., Kyle, A., Samadi, M., & Tuzun, T.

Please see the 16.2 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.2 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.,"Vacuum electronic and solid state high power amplifiers are important technologies for a wide range of military, civilian, and commercial applications. Vacuum electronic amplifiers are based on electron beam transport in vacuum and are capable of high power amplification (gain over 40 dB), output power in the kW range, wide bandwidth (multi-octave), high reliability (100,000 hours), high efficiency (up to 90% with depressed collector), high radiation tolerance, and efficient heat dissipation. Solid state amplifier technologies are based on electron beam transport in semiconductors and tend to have higher reliability (one million hours), but with reduced output power in the range of tens to hundreds of watts and efficiency as high as 40% at microwave frequencies and below. Solid state technologies also exhibit less efficient heat dissipation that contributes to increased system size, weight, and power. Significant progress continues to be demonstrated in both technologies towards higher operating frequencies, bandwidth, and efficiency, although vacuum electronic devices still maintain an edge in applications requiring high power and efficiency at the highest frequencies. The worldwide availability and proliferation of inexpensive, high power commercial amplifiers and sources has made the electromagnetic spectrum crowded and contested in the RF and microwave regions. The wealth of technical advantages offered by operating at higher frequencies, most notably the wide bandwidths available, are pushing both commercial and DoD solid-state and vacuum electron devices into the millimeter wave (mm-wave) region and beyond. However, pushing device operation to THz frequencies results in significant degradation in performance as the device dimensions decrease proportionally. For vacuum electronic amplifiers, the performance degradation is due to the constrained electron beam that must pass through much reduced interaction structures, as well as the challenging manufacturing and alignment tolerances. Similarly, solid state amplifier technologies suffer scaling challenges of their own that significantly limit their performance. Researchers have demonstrated vacuum electronic amplifiers operating at 850 GHz with output power above 50 mW, 15 dB gain, and 11 GHz of bandwidth; and solid state amplifiers operating at 1 THz with output power to several milliwatts, 10 dB gain, and 90 GHz of bandwidth. However, the approaches demonstrated for both technologies are reaching their physical limits at THz frequencies. DARPA is seeking radical and innovative new approaches to fundamentally challenge the limitations imposed on power amplifier technologies at THz frequencies. At a minimum this approach will enable and enable, at the minimum, 1 W output power, 10 dB gain, 10% bandwidth, 50% power efficiency, and predicted reliability of one million hours; all in a reduced form factor for a single amplifier device. The proposed solution will provide technological advantage to military and commercial systems through increased accessibility to the regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that currently are unexplored. The proposed approach must address all aspects of amplifier technology, including power supply and thermal management, necessary to demonstrate capabilities for high performance in a compact form factor at operating frequencies beyond 1 THz.

Linear magnetic behavior of components, such as circulators and oscillators, is efficiently and accurately modeled using any of a variety of standard RF computational engines, including circuit simulators such as Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS) and SPICE. However, these RF computational engines become inefficient and inaccurate for nonlinear and time-dependent magnetic behaviors, thus excluding magnetic components with those signal processing capabilities from the components inventory of RF design engineers. Some of the nonlinear magnetic components of potential value to many RF design engineers include frequency selective limiters (FSL) and signal-to-noise enhancers (SNE), which are self-adaptive (frequency and amplitude) notch and bandpass filters, respectively. Accurate and efficient modeling of the nonlinear and time-dependent magnetic behavior of components such as FSLs and SNEs requires micromagnetics computation engines that operate at the fundamental materials level, which are relatively of insignificance to RF design engineers. In addition, micromagnetics tools are not designed to interface with any specific RF computation engine and tend to produce output data that can be difficult to interpret. This renders micromagnetics tools impractical to RF design engineers and restricts their use, and thus the adoption of self-adaptive components. This impediment can be eased with a user interface capable of interfacing efficiently with both micromagnetics and RF computational engines. As such, this topic calls for innovative solutions for a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with integrated pre- and post-processors that gives the operator an efficient means to set up modeling and simulation problems and scenarios, which includes nonlinear magnetic components, and provides a vehicle for visualization and intuitive interpretation of the simulation output data. The GUI should work with existing RF computation engines and be scalable and robust enough for commercial and military users.",321,2311,1,No,No,No,,"Select one or more candidate RF computation engines and determine input and output data exchange requirements with a high level micromagnetics computation engine.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 16.2 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.2 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.,"There is a critical Department of Defense (DoD) need to create and exploit distributed coherent communications to enable future defense operations to make greater use of small, disaggregated, collaborative elements in contrast to larger elements. The challenge of communicating between clusters of such nodes becomes more acute as their size, weight, and power is reduced, in all environments (air, ground, maritime). The ability to create and exploit distributed coherent communications can be of great benefit to meeting these challenges. The reason for this is that a phase coherent array of n RF transmitters can enhance the power received at a distant receiver by a factor of n^2 relative to a single radio [1]. If the receiver also contains an array of m elements, a factor of (n^2)m power gain can be achieved in one direction, and (m^2)n in the other direction. In a symmetric system, n^3 gain is possible. For example, a distributed coherent collection of 10 transmitters communicating to 10 receivers can ideally reduce the power required of a single transmitter by a factor of 1000. This project is aimed at maximizing the ability to exploit this phenomena. In systems that are not physically connected, the separate challenges of 1) phase coherence between the transmitters, 2) RF channel state measurement, and 3) coordinated sharing of the information communicated must be resolved. While topics associated with coherent communications between groups of users and a centralized base station have been considered in the past, the case of communication between two disaggregated groups is more challenging [2,3,4]. Innovative and practically implementable solutions to these challenges are sought such that the size, weight, and power of the communicating clusters is minimized for a given data rate and operating frequency.",286,1836,1,No,No,No,,"Develop an initial concept design and model key elements of all 3 challenges, and analyze the resulting communication systems properties.

An exemplary demonstration would include n airborne nodes over a variety of link ranges exhibiting n^(3/2) range enhancement relative to a single pair of nodes. Such a system will utilize a local network to establish and maintain communicating groups and to coordinate information transmission between the distant groups. A means for establishing and maintaining coherence among participating users and across groups will be developed. Groups of at least 3 members will be shown, with a preferable goal of 10 group members. Groups shall be flexibly assembled and members may join and leave the assembly in an ad hoc fashion. Phase 2 deliverables shall include the demonstration event, the hardware and software used to effect it, and final report describing the results, a comparison to theoretical expectations, identification of steps needed for further maturation of the technology and open issues or challenges to taking them.","Emergency responders often have a need to communicate in challenging conditions where conventional cellular communication infrastructure may be damaged or destroyed. In such conditions, the ability to communicate between disparate groups of radio-equipped users may be essential. The use of reach-enhancing techniques may be essential in these conditions. Ad hoc communicating clusters of airborne nodes can be used to reduce power demands of autonomous unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) swarms or other collections of small disaggregated sensors. In such environments, small, affordable, stand-in platforms may be called upon to communicate results of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information. The use of distributed coherent group-to-group communications methods may significantly reduce the size, weight, and power burden that would otherwise be required on a single platform.

The low-light imaging sensor should operate in bright sunlight with a large single-detector instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV), and also operate at night with very low ambient light, with sensitivity better than current night vision and low-light sensors by several orders of magnitude. DARPA is interested in developing a photon counting sensor detector array for passive imaging with incoherent illumination, operating in either the linear mode or Geiger mode. The minimum desired array size is 128x128 detectors, and the array technology should be capable of scaling up to 1028x1028 detectors. The array should be capable of passive light detection at frame rate > 30 Hz. The detectors should have an avalanche gain > 100, with an excess noise factor 500 MHz. The detector array should be capable of a FOV > 35 x 35 degrees in bright sunlight in the 800-1200 nm and/or 1500 -1600 nm bands, using passive direct detection with a narrow band filter that is > 3 nm in width. More angle/angle pixels will reduce the need to handle high background radiation in a particular detector. One of the goals of this effort is a passive imaging sensor with high dynamic range in the presence of high daylight background illumination. Another goal is a passive imaging sensor that also has high sensitivity at night with very low ambient flux. The sensor should be capable of incorporating a narrowband filter for operation with active laser illumination, and also a much broader wavelength filter for passive operation. In order to allow the possibility of coherent sensor operation with a strong local oscillator (LO), the sensor readout should be AC coupled or provide some other readout method so the detector dynamic range through narrowband filer or wideband filer operation is not significantly reduced when a strong LO is used. The sensor should be capable of integration into a compact and inexpensive imaging system with minimal required cooling/temperature control hardware.",338,2116,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a detailed description of the detector array and photon counting imaging sensor system capable of operating in NIR or SWIR bands, and should result in a description of the low light imaging performance under extreme low light conditions, a description of the dynamic behavior and electrical properties of the sensor system and a preliminary evaluation of the expected size, weight, and power consumption of a prototype implementation. Phase 1 should address the ability of the proposed approach to operate in bright sunlight with only a moderately narrowband filter and a wide FOV, and should estimate how many photons at a single detector pixel would be required for 90% probability of detection (PD). A single pixel should generate false detections at rate 60 pixels should generate a false object detection at rate < 1 per hour.","Demonstrate the Phase I concept via laboratory breadboard experiments. In Phase 2, a Phase 1 concept will be reduced to practice and performance validated in a laboratory setting. The experiments conducted should result in empirical and/or analytic knowledge that is used to design a preliminary prototype sensor. The laboratory brassboard must provide characterization data that demonstrate by analysis that the performance objectives can be met. The preliminary design should focus on a demonstration system which could be utilized in a field experiment and would directly meet the performance objectives.","The Phase 3 effort should build the preliminary prototype sensor and conduct a field demonstration meeting the performance objective. A Phase 3 demonstration could be applied to a number of commercial applications, including for example: 1) An automobile day/night passive sensor for a driverless car, 2) a lidar sensor for measuring body motions in interactive computer games, and 3) compact day/night passive or active (i.e. lidar) surveillance systems for robotics and/or security. A commercially-focused Phase 3 effort could choose a viable commercial use and build a prototype system optimized for that application.

Additionally, the Phase 3 effort will fill the large need for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensors, and sensors for robots that require full daylight and extreme low light operations. The Phase 3 effort will be able to fabricate short range, inexpensive, relatively wide FOV sensors in large quantities.

The Internet of Things devices and the proliferation of low power communication devices are becoming an increasing factor in wireless operations. Many of these systems use directional signals and operate at high frequencies. These factors make these signals unobservable at large standoff distances. In cases where these signals are detectable, the number of signals detected tends to overwhelm any signal processing system. It is of interest to use large (10s to 100s) numbers of small, low cost platforms to carry a small spectrum collection and processing sensor to provide distributed, wide area coverage for spectral sensing and radio operation understanding. This would solve both the problems of making an individual system ""disposable” and detecting weak signals possible. There are other advantages such as spatial diversity detection (receiving signals simultaneously from many spatial angles), location diversity (seeing signals from many locations), etc. The platforms of interest can include airborne and ground platforms. The challenge is that a mobile platform near a transmitter or flying at low altitudes (to avoid detection) measures a signal with rapidly varying amplitudes and small detection distance. Combining these problems with uncertain or unknown transmitter parameters (duty cycle, antenna pointing angle, antenna beam motion, waveform agility, etc.) makes mobile platform spectrum data interpretation very difficult.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I Only.","The Department of Defense has a critical need for greater availability of timely services provided by space-based assets. These services range from communications to navigation and overhead imagery. New service offerings depend upon more capable and resilient small satellites that may be launched more frequently and at lower cost relative to traditional space systems. Battery size (capacity) requirements for satellites are determined in part by system energy needs. Significant stored energy is necessary to power subsystems while the spacecraft is in the nighttime portion of the orbit when solar panels are in eclipse and receive little sunlight. To realize the next generation of highly capable small satellites, the mass fraction of batteries must be reduced. Adapting energy harvesting systems originally developed for terrestrial utility and wearable electronics applications have been proposed to complement improvements in battery energy density and solar cell efficiency. Piezo energy harvesters (PEHs) convert the kinetic energy of structural vibrations or oscillatory motion to useful electricity. When PEHs are subjected to a harmonic mode, piezoelectric composite material segments embedded in the structure periodically deform, thereby generating electricity. An initial perturbation is typically delivered from the thermally induced release of strain energy in a bistable mechanism with spring- and/or shape-memory-alloy storage member. Following the perturbation, multifunctional structures attached to the spacecraft that incorporate photovoltaics, sensors, and PEH structures may freely vibrate, thereby charging the batteries. PEH systems for satellites must overcome several technical challenges to be practical. First, new piezo composite transducers must be engineered that exhibit greater current density under large strain, on the order of mA/g, resulting in a measurable reduction in the required battery size. Second, the mechanism that applies the perturbation and the PEH smart structure dynamic properties (mass, effective stiffness, and damping) should be engineered for an oscillation that decays over a period of time comparable to the nighttime portion of the orbit. It should also be capable of being passively reset during the daytime portion of the orbit. Third, the multifunctional smart structure containing the PEH system must not add more than 2 percent to the spacecraft total mass budget. Lastly, the system must operate in a manner that does not adversely affect spacecraft attitude control or introduce excessive jitter in imaging sensors. Innovative solutions are sought to these problems, leading to the first operational small satellite PEH system. The PEH prototype is envisioned to be demonstrated on the ground in an evacuated neutral gravity environment, and in low Earth orbit (LEO) on board a 6U cubesat or similar small (less than 50 kg) satellite.",423,2906,1,No,No,No,,"Design a small satellite with a technically feasible multifunctional smart structure that supports photovoltaics and the PEH system with supporting sensors and rectification electronics.

Existing graphite-fiber composite-pressure vessels can safely operate without leaks with multi-axis strain levels in excess of 15,000 microstrain, however conventional graphite-fiber composite cryotanks tend to operate at less than 5,000 microstrain [Ref 1]. This means that these cryotanks tend to be three times heavier than a pressure vessel designed for the same operating pressure. Achieving 15,000 microstrain in a graphite-fiber composite cryotank would offer the capability to achieve tank weight/volume that is far less than the metal cryotanks currently in use in space launch vehicles [Ref 2], enabling improved vehicle performance and payload delivery. In this effort, DARPA seeks very low-cost and lightweight composite cryotanks that offer substantially better cost and weight/volume than state-of-the-art tanks. The target performance is to achieve a recurring production cost of less than $1,000/ft3 internal volume and less than 0.50 lbm/ft3 (weight of tank/volume of tank) performance in a reference cryotank that is 6 ft. in diameter with a volume of 350 ft3, assuming a minimum burst of 120 psi, not including structural load bearing skirt extensions. The cryotank needs to remain leak-tight after repeated cryogenic temperature and pressure cycles, with a minimum threshold of 25 combined cycles and a goal of more than 1,000 combined cycles.

Using test results, develop a conceptual design of a cryotank that would demonstrate the weight/volume goal for the reference tank requirements.

Achieving the combined cycle goal would provide this performance advantage to reusable vehicles, thereby reducing launch costs.

In recent years, the neuroscience field has benefited from advances in instrumentation and computing resources that routinely generate large, rich datasets in many model systems. However, access to these precious data is typically restricted to the source lab and close collaborators, limiting scientific output. In addition, published results are often highly processed versions of only a small fraction of the source data, further restricting public access to the data and impeding efforts to perform verification studies, much less meta analyses. Given the rapid growth in neuroscience and increasing concerns over lack of reproducibility in science, there is an increasing need for tools that enable widespread sharing of data and analysis procedures throughout the scientific community. An ‘open data’ platform will provide the neuroscience community with access to valuable data, increasing scientific productivity and promoting greater transparency. Data sharing facilitates efficiency in scientific process through reductions in the costs of collecting data and leveraging existing datasets to derive additional results. Furthermore, sharing of analytic tools reduces the necessity for each lab to develop custom software for analyzing data types that other labs may have developed already. Open access also promotes greater transparency in the scientific process, making it easier to replicate findings, and to reconcile discrepancies in published works. Neuroscience data sharing has been limited by several factors, including file size, highly customized formatting, source variability, complex metadata, and unreliable data quality. Additionally, the scientific community is facing ever increasing scrutiny over the lack of reproducibility in science. This topic seeks to advance neuroscientific data sharing by developing standardized software tools that can address these issues and garner wide adoption in order to facilitate collaboration, discovery, and repeatability in the field. Solutions to three particular challenges are of interest in this topic. The first is to develop automated methods for combining and annotating data sets to permit large-scale analyses by third parties. This is particularly challenging given the wide variety of experimental methods, data collection equipment, and data quality, identifying appropriate datasets for co-analysis, as well as methods for combining datasets. Second, the software system must support a flexible set of analysis procedures that can be annotated and archived along with the source data, such that the entire workflow from data generation through analysis can be documented and tracked. Collectively, these capabilities would allow for greater transparency in the reporting of scientific results and facilitate access by third party investigators. Thirdly, a robust data rights system must be implemented. Each data set is generated by investigators with unique requirements, and they may have highly-specific restrictions on the use of the data they share with third parties. The data rights system must be flexible enough to allow for publication embargo, restrictions on download of raw data, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements. Successful proposals will identify and address the needs of data contributors, data users, instrument manufacturers, and the scientific community at large. The proposal should contain tangible approaches to facilitate adoption by a wide swathe of neuroscientists, neuroengineers, neurologists, and instrumentation manufacturers. Uploading data should be as user-friendly as possible, for instance by auto-parsing metadata automatically from common file types. Shareable formats utilized by the software should adhere to scientific community standards whenever possible or define new standards where none exist. Straightforward analysis, data quality metrics, modeling functions, and tools for documenting data handling should be part of a successful solution. It is intended that the software system will be cloud-based, ensuring that the data is widely available to the scientific community.",613,4334,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the software foundation for a suite of tools to store and analyze metadata, securely store the raw data, selectively grant access to the data, and provide application programming interfaces to interact with common tools for data analysis, including Matlab and R.

The specific neuroscience data type(s) and analysis methods must be defined in the proposal. The initial feature set need not be comprehensive, but the software framework should be extensible to allow for additional data types and methods to be added later. A key deliverable of Phase I is generation of a commercialization report describing a clear and viable business model to sustain development and maintenance of the software system. This report must contain clear and tangible approaches to foster wide adoption of the software system among the various communities and should include relevant letters of support from any external parties required for this plan. This report must contain quantified metrics for success regarding adoption during and beyond Phase II.","Extend the Phase I system to enable data import of a wider range of formats and online analysis functions. Proposers should demonstrate this capability by incorporating multiple large datasets available from the literature and/or from collaborators, selectively granting access to collaborators, and performing an initial meta-analysis of the resulting data sets. The Phase II system should also provide mechanisms for communication between the data contributor and parties interested in utilizing it in their research. These communications should include permission requests, conditions of use (such as embargo duration, requirements for authorship or acknowledgement, or ability to download raw data for offline analysis), dialog regarding the metadata, and feedback on the results. In addition, the software must comply with all relevant HIPAA requirements for human subjects research and provide mechanisms to protect personally identifiable information (PII) and verify institutional review board (IRB) approval should the data rights allow for transfer of PII. Finally, as this is a primarily online system, it must track adoption and usage levels by end-users and include means to measure metrics for the impact of each stored element of data. The final Phase II system must include open application programming interfaces to allow for customization by the end user. Final deliverables for Phase II include a report documenting the adoption of the system and responsiveness to user needs. Furthermore, the Phase II pilot user-group must be surveyed to objectively determine the requirements for Phase III upgrades and modifications. Direct to Phase II: Existing software solutions that achieve the objectives stated within Phase I are applicable for Direct to Phase II submission. The proposal should clearly describe how the objectives of Phase I have been attained.","Neuroscience research has the potential to improve the performance of servicemen and women and increase effectiveness in their duties.

The use of insects for sustainable production of food, feed, and pharma products could also potentially be applied in far-forward deployed operating situations, and might ultimately even be an enabler for space exploration. Insects are already a reliable source of food, feed, and pharma products for human use, but at times can be difficult to exploit due to either pathogen outbreaks in colonies during rearing or contamination of organic and inorganic materials during processing. At the same time, genetic and genomic approaches to alter expression systems in insects are becoming available and can be used to improve the value of insect-derived products. Immense opportunities now exist to drastically improve the utility of insect production systems regardless of the intended insect-derived end product. Food security is quickly becoming a global security issue due to increasing human populations and consumption demands. Several factors could lead to a possible catastrophic decline in food availability in the near future, including climate change, energy shortages, and decreased agricultural production due to reduced soil fertility and water availability, and greater numbers and distribution patterns of pests and plant pathogens. Identification of reliable alternatives for traditional foods—and in particular alternative sources of protein—could help meet future nutritional demands, improve food security and bolster geopolitical stability. New technologies to support these alternatives must lend themselves to large-scale implementation if they are to be feasible, cost-effective, and ecofriendly. Insects offer one potential solution to current and future food shortages and nutrient deficiencies. Although 80% of the world’s population regularly consumes insects for food, this is a relatively new concept for the Western world. Production of traditional protein sources such as beef, pork, chicken, and fish is expensive, resource intensive, and not sustainably scalable to a growing population. Insect sourcing for food products that can be consumed directly by humans is an alternative to traditional meat production; insect-derived feeds could also be used for aquaculture or livestock production to reduce the ecological footprint of these food sources. Insects are highly nutritious relative to traditional protein-rich foods. For instance, milled cricket flour (a popular food additive) contains 31g of protein and 8g of fat per 200 calories compared to 22g of protein and 15g of fat for the same 200 calories in beef. Insects have also been used to produce non-food products for human use. The use of insects for production of silk and dyes is well known, but other uses of insect-derived products have been identified more recently. For example, certain insects produce powerful antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as drosocin, apidaecin 1b, and pyrrhocoricin, which can be recovered and purified for human use. Additionally, insect germlines could be modified to produce high levels of desired compounds such as retinol or ascorbic acid for delivery to populations with diets deficient in these nutrients. The recent discovery that chitin-based products can be used to improve whole-blood clotting time and plasma recalcification time has led to the development of insect-derived products like chitin, chitosan, partially N-acetylated chitosan, N,O-carboxymethylchitosan, N-sulfated chitosan, and N-(2-hydroxy)propyl-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride as potentially more cost-effective alternatives to existing commercial blood products. Gene technologies could be used to improve production of edible insect products or to alleviate losses due to biotic or abiotic threats. Molecular approaches to these issues will be an integral part of increasing general output in these systems in the future and could be used to improve quality of product and ease of processing, and minimize loss of recovered product. This SBIR topic seeks approaches to identify and address issues associated with large-scale insect rearing and/or the improvement of production outcomes. We encourage applications that use emerging genetic/genomic tools to these ends. Expected outcomes could be the management of viral or bacterial pathogens through up- or down-regulation of genes that exist in the host or pathogen, improvement of colony insect populations to adapt to altered environments, or the manipulation of pathways that provide products for human use.",678,4665,1,No,No,No,,"Identify molecular targets for improving production and performance of insects that will ultimately be produced in large-scale operations. Individual projects could address at least one of several challenges expected, which include: (1) refining pathogen management, (2) improving quality and quantity of desirable insect organic materials that exist, (3) reducing or eliminating the production of undesirable products, (4) addition of genes to produce desirable products that did not previously exist in the insect. Integrate genetic modifications into systems (transgenic or paratransgenic systems are acceptable) to increase the nutrient output of insects being produced for food sourcing. The addition of pathways associated with vitamin A, C, D, and K are especially desirable. Identify a diverse group of insect species that process animal/human, food, and plant waste for energy and biomass recovery. This would not have to result directly into human food sourcing (i.e., primary production of food production); rather, the potential for improving food stock production for fish and livestock production would be appropriate, with humans as secondary consumers. The key deliverable for Phase I will be the demonstration of proof of concept that the selected challenge has been overcome and can be scaled to a larger format. These demonstrations can be performed in repeated experiments in small colonies on multiple insect species where alteration of insect-derived end products can be shown through chemical analysis.","The small-scale, small-colony approach taken in Phase I will be transferred to and implemented in a large-scale insect products-sourcing platform. The goal of Phase II is the integration of technologies used to produce insects for food, feed, or pharma. Therefore, the deliverable for Phase II is the demonstration of a large-scale insect production system utilizing integrated gene technologies. Communication with the proper regulatory agencies will be a key component to determine how these technologies can be safely and ethically monitored for proper use. Direct to Phase II: Potential proposers with existing technologies that are ready to be implemented in a large-scale format are encouraged to apply for direct to Phase II. The proposal should clearly describe how the objectives of Phase I have already been attained.","Phase III (Commercial): The genetic/genomic technologies developed in Phases I and II will be integrated into a fundamental platform to improve the production of insect-derived products. These integrated technologies will serve as the foundation for further improvement. Phase III will be a demonstration of a fully adopted system that utilizes two or more gene technologies to improve production. These improvements must also be ecologically sustainable. In addition to the development of a plan for regulatory oversight, Phase III projects should address the challenge of encouraging human acceptance of insects and insect-derived products as food. Phase III (Military): The integration of insect-derived food products into the Combat Feeding Directorate is a potential option for technology transition. The objective of Phase III (Military) will be to determine feasibility, utility, and acceptance levels of these products and production systems by military personnel, especially in deployment scenarios.",1,"Janvikul, W., Uppanan, P., Thavornyutikarn, B., Krewraing, J., & Prateepasen, R.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 16.3 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.3 Phase I OR Direct to Phase II Instructions for proposal instructions.,"There is a critical DoD need to develop next-generation genome editing tools that will provide a multifunctional platform capability to address emerging and engineered biothreats to animals, people, and agriculture, create new sensors to detect chem/biothreats, and rapidly develop new agricultural and preclinical animal models for countermeasure development and validation. The emergence of precision genome editing tools, including clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and zinc finger nucleases, has provided an unprecedented ability to modify genomes in a manner that is rapid, adaptable, and has the potential to be highly multiplexed. Among these, CRISPR-based tools have emerged as the gene editors of choice for many applications, given their modular architecture, low cost, ease of design and synthesis, and adaptability for a broad range of applications (for review, see 1, 2). These tools have the potential to enable and accelerate new capabilities and applications in public health, agriculture, biotechnology, and fundamental biological research discovery. While genome editing tools have already been widely adopted by research and development communities, major technical hurdles exist that must be addressed before the full potential of these tools can be realized for advanced applications that move beyond a research setting. These technical challenges include unwanted off-target effects at genome sites outside of the target locus/loci, low efficiency of activity at target sites due to delivery and/or expression challenges, and an overall lack of understanding of organism-level responses to these tools to include host immunogenic responses. Off-target activity at sites outside of intended genome target(s) can result in unwanted and potentially deleterious effects in cells and organisms that can outnumber on-target modifications. Progress has been made to improve the fidelity of gene editors, including the development of ""nickases” that minimize off-targets effects, however, reductions in off-target activity often results in decreased on-target activity, reducing the overall efficiency of the system (3). More recent demonstrations indicating that Cas9 nucleases can be engineered for significantly increased specificity are encouraging (4,5), however, proof of concept is still lacking that these approaches can be applied to a broad range of host cell types/species and to nuclease variants derived from various sources. In addition, the desire to use genome editing tools in a multi-target, multiplex capacity for a range of applications significantly increases the chances for spurious off-target activity. Finally, the efficient delivery and timely activation of the molecular tools required to edit genomes in vivo in target cells and organisms presents an additional challenge that must be addressed. Optimal delivery of viral and non-viral solutions for gene encoded gene editors will require efficient transfer to target cells/tissues, packaging that is amenable to single construct/simple formulation, and temporal control of activity and expression of gene editors to achieve measureable impact at target sites with minimal off target activity. This topic is focused on improving the utility of genome editing tools by developing the next generation of nuclease-based effectors that overcome these key technical hurdles associated with current generation genome editing tools. Anticipated outcomes include development of nuclease based gene editors with no detectable off-target activity in a range of host cells in multiplex mode, improved in vivo target efficiency, and improved packaging of genome editor components into a single genetic construct for host cell delivery. Successful technologies will combine high fidelity and efficiency into viral vectors, mRNA, or other suitable methods for transfer of gene- encoded constructs in vivo.",563,3975,1,No,No,No,,"Establish the technical feasibility of new approaches to address off-target activity and delivery challenges for the development of next generation gene editors. Proposers must address at least one of the following technical challenges: The first challenge seeks to develop gene editing methodologies that enable modification of a target genome at multiple unique loci simultaneously in the absence of off-target activity (e.g., single constant nuclease enzyme with 10 variable guide RNAs) without compromising fidelity or efficiency. Modification of the genome may involve sequence-modifying and/or non-sequence modifying approaches (e.g., epigenetic gene silencing approaches, etc.). Methods for improved in vitro, in vivo, or in silico detection of off-target activity of the gene editors are also anticipated. The second challenge seeks to develop a capability to deliver gene editors in a single genetic construct and/or simple formulation that is broadly applicable to multiple cells lines relevant for pre-clinical and clinical study and/or agricultural investigation (to include plant, mammalian, and insect cells). Temporal control of gene editors should be built into the system to prevent long-term expression/activation of gene editors in vivo, which may result in an increased likelihood for off-target effects. For example, delivery of engineered nucleases as mRNA or purified protein may reduce the frequency of off-target effects by lowering the protein amount and time of expression, but this may also be achieved through transcriptional controls or other methods as proposed by investigators. A delivery strategy should be sufficiently modular to accommodate a gene editor and a minimum of 10 guide sequences simultaneously without compromising fidelity or efficiency. For the challenge areas described above, methods to quantitatively measure on-target and off-target activity should be clearly described with a focus on strategies that allow fast, sensitive and cost-effective detection of on- and off- target activities. Performance goals for efficiency of delivery and on-target activity must be established by the proposers with appropriate technical rationale, comparison with the state of the art, and risk mitigation strategies. For a given approach, the number of unique loci that will be targeted must be clearly indicated, accompanied by the appropriate rationale to support why this number is sufficient to achieve desired effect for a given application. For the selected challenge, develop an initial concept design and describe an approach for transitioning this technology from a laboratory benchtop to an established commercial protocol. Phase I deliverables will include: 1) a technical report detailing the experiments and results supporting the successful demonstration of a next-generation genome editing tool(s) that results in no detectable off-target activity and/or can be delivered using a single-genetic construct with high efficiency to meet the selected technical challenge; and 2) a Phase II transition plan for demonstrating sufficient reproducibility of gene editor performance, advanced development to demonstrate a multiplex capability, and potential research advancement to merit commercialization. The Phase II transition plan will include a description of the commercialization path, any barriers to market entry, and any identified early adoption partners.","Finalize and validate the genome editing tools and experimental approaches from Phase I and initiate the development and production of the technology to address the selected technical challenge. Progress from in vitro (i.e., cell-culture) demonstration to whole-organism in vivo proof-of-concept demonstration for the selected challenge. Establish appropriate performance parameters through experimentation to determine the efficaciousness, robustness, and fidelity of the approach being pursued. Develop, demonstrate, and validate the reagents and protocols necessary to meet the key metrics as defined for the selected technical challenge. Phase II deliverables include a prototype set of reagents, a detailed technical protocol sufficient to allow replication of results in an outside laboratory, and valid test data, appropriate for a commercial production path.","Next-generation genome editing tools will provide a multifunctional platform capability for the DoD to address emerging and engineered biothreats to animals, people, and agriculture, create new sensors to detect chem/biothreats, and rapidly develop new agricultural and preclinical animal models for countermeasure development and validation.

Next-generation genome editors will advance investigation in agriculture to increase crop yields and protect against climate and pest threats. Ultimately, the ability to edit genomic targets within a host cell in the absence of off-target effects will be transformative for the development of clinical applications and the application of these tolls in open systems and environments for a broad range of applications.",1,"Kleinstiver, BP et al.

With this expansion from single- material to multi-material printing provided by several on-going DARPA programs, there is a need within industry and the DoD for a real-time metrology system and inspection platform. This could significantly increase the quality of printed parts and reduce the risk of critical print defects. Most current methods rely on scanning the printed product upon completion of printing rather than scanning in real- time. Systems monitoring printing processes while printing currently exist but are often limited to one material. Increasing the number of materials poses several unique metrology requirements. The materials have different optical properties which can make it difficult to scan large areas rapidly while maintaining high resolution. While scanning, the data generated from the platform should also be used in characterization of the process and feedback control of the system. The feedback control should serve to ensure fidelity in the print geometry, guarantee adequate interfaces between adjacent materials, and be able to adapt to different classes of materials for additive manufacturing. The software package associated with the hardware should enable scan data to be processed efficiently in or near real-time. The feedback method should be robust to the printing process used and be applicable to different printer systems.

Additive manufacturing encompasses several methods to build parts by depositing and fusing small amounts of material at a time. Additive manufacturing has the potential to democratize manufacturing because of its low cost of entry and ease of sharing files that contain full part descriptions. However, these features also make it uniquely susceptible to malicious tampering. Several additive manufacturing technologies are rapidly improving to a point where soon it will be feasible to make mission critical parts. A mission critical part is one where failure of the part may lead to material losses, injury or loss of life. It is therefore important when a validated part description is manufactured that the results can be trusted and appropriate assurances made that all the process validation requirements are met. This becomes of paramount importance and particularly challenging when manufacturing is outsourced. The current manufacturing workflow consists of multiple actors: 1. The authoring tool which created the specification of the object to be made 2. The transmission medium to communicate the specification to the machine tool controller 3. The machine tool post processor which converts the part specification into actions to build the part 4. The machine tool controller and hardware (lasers, stepper motors, etc.) 5. The material Currently, there is little assurance that part specifications will be adequately protected from intentional or unintentional changes after they leave the authoring tool, nor are there any assurances that the required manufacturing processes or materials were used. Resulting deviations in manufactured artifacts can be difficult, if not impossible, to detect without extensive inspection or destructive testing. Some of these vulnerabilities are described in the National Institute of Standards and Technology report NIST.IR.8041, available here: http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2015/NIST.IR.8041.pdf. The intent of this topic is to identify all vulnerabilities in the additive manufacturing workflow, then propose and prototype solutions to one or more of the following (but not limited to): • Tamper proof description and transmission of specification • Embedded validation of the machine tool specification • Enable easy detection of tampering in the final artifact, embedding provenance • Embedding material signatures Proposers are encouraged to leverage solutions from other domains such as: encryption, digital watermarking, digital rights management and techniques inspired from detecting computer viruses. It is expected that the outcome of this investigation will disrupt multiple aspects of the current additive manufacturing workflow, including but not limited to: part description, process description, embedded validation, changes to machine tool controller software and hardware.",422,2970,1,No,No,No,,"Identify all the weaknesses in the entire additive manufacturing chain, and estimate the level of effort required to mitigate the vulnerabilities.

Voice Phishing or ""Vishing” is the use of social engineering techniques to trick users of telephone systems to reveal private information. This attack takes advantage of minimal security in telephony systems and perceived trust in the caller to obtain sensitive, high value personal, financial, and proprietary data. Even though this attack has existed for decades, it is growing and a recent estimate puts the cost to businesses and consumers at billions of dollars [1]. Efforts to educate employees and consumers (including the elderly) have had limited success as attackers use increasingly sophisticated techniques such as phone number spoofing, voice masking, and targeted personal messages. To counter this growing threat, this topic seeks to develop technology for accurate, automated real-time audio authentication. Current research [2] has focused on human driven authentication in both analog and digital audio recordings collected as legal evidence and has not directly addressed this growing security threat. Proposers to this topic should describe how their final product will generalize to common audio attacks including, but not limited to impersonators, spliced audio, pre-recordings, and disguised or synthesized audio. Proposed techniques should also be robust to varying microphones, environmental conditions, compression, sampling rates found in a range of devices such as mobile phones, headsets, and newer voice over IP hardware.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 16.3 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.3 Phase I OR Direct to Phase II Instructions for proposal instructions.,"There is a critical DoD need for new machine learning and human-computer interaction techniques to produce more explainable resource allocation and recommendation systems. Dramatic success in machine learning has led to an explosion of AI applications, including recommendation systems that can learn subtle matches between resources and needs. However current machine learning models are opaque and inherently difficult for end-users to understand. Attempts to explain current machine learning models have been limited to methods that try to portray a set of complex and often highly-dimensional features used in the system’s computation. Such explanations are often too detailed, at the wrong level of abstraction, and make little sense to common users trying to understand why a system acted the way it did. It is vital to develop more explainable techniques. Current sophisticated machine learning techniques are capable of finding useful matches, such as those between veteran skill sets and commercial jobs, but these techniques need to be enhanced to explain non-obvious matches to both parties. For example, it would be possible to apply current machine learning techniques to learn meaningful but non-obvious matches between veterans’ skills and commercial job requirements that would result in successful employment. Yet current techniques would not be able to explain the rationale for these non-obvious matches to prospective employers or veterans. Current sophisticated machine learning techniques are capable of finding useful job matches such as these, but these techniques need to be enhanced to explain these non-obvious matches to both parties. There are numerous services that assist veterans in the transition to civilian life and in the search for jobs; yet adapting military skill sets for civilian posts as well as the veteran employment referral process are lagging. Automation can automatically learn and update these matches to ensure veterans remain competitive candidates in this rapidly changing job market. Furthermore, new job and skill categories often arise in the civilian job market, where there is no direct military parallel for these posts. For example, ""data science”, for which no direct translation may exist, but which may be already part of the service in many military units. By leveraging existing mappings of military codes to occupations and data publicly available from online source (e.g. job boards), it may be possible to learn a better and more fine-grained mapping that is explainable to veterans and employers. In contrast to current practice, the resulting mapping as well as the explanations could be constructed automatically and dynamically from data. This topic seeks the development and application of new machine learning and human-computer interaction techniques to produce more explainable resource allocation and recommendation systems. This can include developing techniques to learn richer models and more fine-grained mappings that are more interpretable. Additionally, the development of explanation principles, feature summarization schemes, interface metaphors, visualization and explanation generation techniques can be utilized to present a comprehensible explanation to the user. Proposers should describe their approach for designing and developing new machine learning and human-computer interaction techniques to produce more explainable resource allocation and recommendation systems. They should also select a resource allocation problem domain, such as matching veterans’ skills to commercial job requirements, and propose the development of a system to address that problem.",530,3654,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a plan for creating machine learning tools and techniques that can both learn subtle resource allocation recommendations and generate appropriate explanations for different contexts.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 16.3 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.3 Phase I OR Direct to Phase II Instructions for proposal instructions.,"Deterrence is a strategy intended to dissuade an adversary from undesirable action. Our nation is entering a period where adversary action and our response to those actions will frequently take place in a segment of the conflict continuum that some are calling the ""Gray Zone,” characterized by intense political, economic, informational, and military competition more fervent in nature than normal steady-state diplomacy, yet short of conventional war. A core impediment to studying deterrence in this realm lies in the fact that success is defined by the absence of an adversarial action. Success is difficult to demonstrate because absence of actions could result from alternative variables not always attributable to the deterrent strategy itself. To confound observation further, the presence and absence of conflict is no longer black and white. There exists a continuum of action between war and peace comprised of (but not limited to) propaganda distribution, unconventional warfare, cyber harassment, covert operatives, diplomatic aggression, economic warfare, terrorism, and proxy forces. Adversarial actors often tune strategies to weaken their opponent, or cause them to spend political or economic capital, without triggering a repercussion threshold, further complicating assessment of a deterrent counter strategy. This topic seeks new technologies that can measure and explain the effectiveness of deterrent strategies in the Gray Zone leveraging open source data. To assess the success of a deterrent, it is necessary to establish evidence that the deterrent effect was achieved, and that the deterrent action taken was a primary cause of the achieved effect. The first requires identifying evidence of a change in intentions on the part of the adversary, and the second requires identifying and assessing alternative explanations for that change in intent. Both require advances over the state of the art in ability to model threat intentions and to explain observations based on data, and require a systematic perspective that examines the complex set of conditions, actors, tactics, strategies, and outcomes across conflict holistically.",320,2157,1,No,No,No,,"Create a notional framework that captures and incorporates the significant factors associated with deterrence in the “Gray Zone.” The goal is to provide a notional framework with a practical number of significant entities, conflict/competition types, and deterrent strategies to allow a commander or analyst to understand the system and what affects change and how. Basic capability must be demonstrated to build a portion of the proposed framework in software demonstrating the ability to measure effects of selected deterrent strategies in a relevant scenario. Define metrics and thresholds for successful assessment and demonstrate ability to measure those metrics. Phase I deliverables will include a demonstration to the government; a report documenting research results, the design for the deterrence framework, and results of testing against the identified scenario; and source code developed under the Phase I effort.","Leveraging the framework derived in Phase I, complete the system design and build a prototype that further enhances and develops the capabilities in Phase I to a level of capability that can be assessed for operational utility. The prototype should demonstrate successful performance against the metrics defined in Phase I using scenarios and data sets identified in conjunction with an operational partner such as a combatant command. Conduct testing in conjunction with the partner to assess utility of the prototype capability. Phase II deliverables will include demonstrations to the government in each year of the Phase II program; and an interim report each year but the final year documenting research results, the design of the demonstration prototype, and results of testing against relevant scenarios; a final report at the end of Phase II documenting research results, the design of the demonstration prototype, results of testing against relevant scenarios, and a plan for Phase III transition; and source code for each demonstration prototype.","The envisioned end state of the research is a capability that can provide a robust capability for operational (combatant command) users to assess and understand the effectiveness of deterrent strategies against adversaries in “Gray Zone” conflict situations. This capability should be able to be deployed to a combatant command in conjunction with, or integrated as part of, a suite of command and control applications in use by an operational command. Specifically, this research should result in a commercializable technology for assessing and explaining adversary intentions and actions from open source data.

Please see the 16.3 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 16.3 Phase I OR Direct to Phase II Instructions for proposal instructions.,"There is a critical DoD need to develop power sources that will increase the mission lifetime for unattended sensors and sensor radio networks. Commercially available small batteries and power sources are limited to output voltages greater than 1.2V and require external components such as regulators to produce stable supply voltages less than 1V. Recent advances in deep subthreshold analog and digital electronics are creating classes of intelligent electronics capable of achieving power consumption levels as low as 10 nW (1). These subthreshold circuits require power supply voltages typically in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 V. While subthreshold circuits can now achieve extremely low power, the regulators needed to produce the 0.3 to 0.7 V level supply voltages from typical battery voltages in excess of 1.2V can easily dominate the total power consumption. In order to take advantage of these recent advances in extremely low power subthreshold circuits to greatly extend the lifetime of electronic systems, new battery or small scale power source technologies are needed that are capable of directly producing stable and tailorable voltage levels in the 0.3 – 0.7 V range. This topic seeks primary batteries or other power sources that can directly produce stable output voltages between 0.3 and 0.7 V over the lifetime, operating temperature range and specified output current range of the power source. Solutions where the battery or power source voltage can be tailored in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 V, for example by stacking lower voltage cells, are highly desired. In addition to the desired voltage properties, the power source must also have a coin cell like form factor, a self-discharge rate of less than 1% per year at room temperature, be stable over an output current range from 0 to 1 µA and have a capacity greater than 80 mAH.

Whether using spectral or coherent beam combining, these fiber laser arrays are pumped by high-power fiber-coupled laser diode modules. These modules are a key driver of the overall required size, weight, and required electrical power of HEL systems. Highly efficient diodes significantly reduce both the required diode electrical power input and thermal management system requirements due to their lower heat generation.

Many of the communications and imaging microsatellites at the vanguard of the New Space revolution hitch a ride to low Earth orbit (LEO) aboard launch vehicles carrying larger, primary satellite payloads. In a typical launch vehicle payload assembly, the primary satellite is stacked atop an ESPA ring, an aluminum ring similar in appearance to a section of pipe. A common ESPA ring has a bolt circle diameter of 1.58 m, with a height of 0.6 m. Up to six circular ports with flanges are arranged about the circumference of the ring that serve as the attachment points for microsatellite secondary payloads. Each secondary payload port has a 0.38-m bolt circle diameter. Recently, space launch service providers have created discrete satellites with the ESPA structure. Some include propulsion subsystems to realize a so-called ""space tug” that is useful in transporting secondary payloads to their planned orbits. In the future, these ESPA space tugs may include robotic arms and similar mechanisms to expand their on-orbit assembly and servicing capabilities. Aside from providing rigid support for the primary and secondary payloads and space tug subassemblies during launch, the bulk of the ESPA ring structure serves little mission-related purpose once the payloads are deployed. In today’s space systems where every kilogram launched to LEO costs tens of thousands of dollars, significant value may be realized by an ESPA that is engineered to be truly multifunctional. New technology could generate greater revenue from a smarter, multifunctional ESPA. This SBIR topic seeks new innovation to realize a multifunctional ESPA consisting of subelements that would provide structural support to two or more secondary payloads during launch and, upon arrival in LEO, would be at least 90 percent deconstructed and reconfigured by a service apparatus included in the ESPA space tug. In this case, the deconstructed ESPA subelements are intended for reassembly directly onto one of the secondary payloads as functional elements of a large-aperture radio frequency (RF) phased array antenna. The post-launch deconstruction of the ESPA and subsequent reassembly into the new phased array configuration would have be accomplished within a mission-compatible time period not to exceed 90 minutes. As stated previously, the service apparatus would be assumed to exist in the ESPA space tug service vehicle that flies with the launch vehicle. The service vehicle would store and/or generate some or all of the energy required to accomplish the change in system configuration (from ESPA support structure to phased array antenna), not to exceed 600 MJ. The total mass of the multifunctional ESPA ring could not exceed that of the basic ESPA described above (approximately 105 kg). Note this mass refers to the ring structure itself and not the service vehicle’s internal systems. The resulting phased array antenna would have to be capable of closing a Ka-band link from an altitude of 1,000 km to a terrestrial 0.5-m very small aperture terminal (VSAT) receiver with minimum 3 dB link margin. Nominal atmospheric attenuation is assumed in a non-interference environment.",513,3288,1,No,No,No,,"Perform computational analysis and trade studies leading to a top-level, preliminary design of the multifunctional ESPA ring. The preliminary design should include a system concept of operations (CONOPS) that describes the sequence of converting from multifunctional ESPA ring to phased array antenna with a rough order-of-magnitude estimate of cycle time and energy. In addition, analysis must quantify the expected phased array antenna performance in terms of a link budget. Phase I would culminate in a preliminary design review (PDR).","Refine the preliminary system design to create a detailed design of the multifunctional ESPA system and mission CONOPS. The detailed design would include subsystem- and component-level definitions with updated mass, energy, and link budgets leading to a critical design review (CDR) and limited prototyping and functional testing of key subsystems and components.","Commercial Application—The prime user of the technology would likely be launch service original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as CSA-Moog, the maker of the ESPA. These companies continuously strive to add more functionality and capability to these products, as evidenced by the advent of the SHERPA ring, which has control and propulsion capabilities. The so-called “killer app” would be one in which a commercial LEO communications or imaging microsatellite would be augmented after launch with the deconstructed ESPA ring elements/building blocks to form a large, high-performance phased array antenna, larger than any deployable array that could be accommodated within the microsatellite. DoD/Military Application—By using launch vehicle payload mass more efficiently, the multifunctional ESPA system could yield greater RF performance (and hence greater revenue or return on investment (ROI)) per kilogram for microsatellite secondary payloads. Greater RF performance would enable new data products for the warfighter, including delivery of overhead imagery and near real-time video, all for lower capital investment in a microsatellite secondary payload. Lastly, it would also open an avenue for a broader on-orbit service economy that creates commerce on Earth.",1,"Lo, A. S. et al.

Moving to a compositional model for task-oriented systems would allow designs that facilitate many rapid future adaptations, the nature of which do not have to be specified in advance. Compositional approaches to platforms would seek to create system capabilities by combining subsystems that are maximally homogenous and minimally stateful, while acknowledging limitations to approaching these extrema in cyber-physical systems. This approach would have great value in rapidly developing military-specific capabilities and also enabling rapid technical advances via re-use. A notional example of a task-oriented system could include a specialized robotic manipulation system. The principal metric of goodness of a composable platform architecture is time to meet an unknown, previously unspecified need. This approach stands in contrast to standard multi-objective systems engineering approaches that focus on simultaneously satisfying or optimizing around multiple performance requirements. It is expected that a composable approach could produce instantiated systems faster than a conventional optimization-centric approach with manageable performance trades. In an envisioned future, an engineer or non-expert user would be able to leverage hardware and software parts bins and—in the space of minutes, hours, or days—be able to produce a functional platform system to support a specific application. The user would be able to interact with available components and a compiler-like toolchain for the composition process. Composable architectures have been used in pure software systems, with self-orchestrating services creating higher-level capabilities. Cyber-physical systems are often highly stateful and not cleanly encapsulated, with complex multi-physics interactions between components. This topic seeks to explore the viability of the concept of composable architectures for task-oriented platforms and under this effort would apply the concept to ground robotic systems, which are expected to benefit from improved development timelines and be capable of tolerating some degree of performance overhead in support of improved service encapsulation. This exploration is expected to encompass development of a foundational framework for a composable architecture, supporting toolchains, and initial toolbox elements. The effort is expected to conclude with a hardware-software demonstration constrained by time. If successful, the effort would lower the barrier for entry to robotics development. As a result, significant military and commercial spinoff opportunities are anticipated, and proposers are encouraged to consider such opportunities. As a point-of-departure culminating in a Phase II demonstration concept, proposers should consider the following content: (1) Develop and demonstrate a highly mobile, Soldier-carried reconnaissance/engineering robot that would perform a mission set over 30-60 minutes and 100 meters in an urban training facility, roughly equivalent to a move- to-detect, move-to-contact, enter/clear-a-room scenario. In addition, with the same component hardware and compositional toolchain software set, compose (2) a mobile manipulation robot to do a subset of two to three maintenance/assembly tasks (for example, exchange radio batteries between radios and chargers, remove tire lug nuts, etc.). The system should not simply be a two-point design, but should be (3) extensible to unanticipated applications. In a notional culminating demo, (1) and (2) would be demonstrated within hours of each other.",502,3645,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a foundational hardware library, software repository, and initial compositional toolchain that support concept demonstrations in a simulation environment.

Develop a bus-based architectural and physical backbone to allow for more open-ended extensibility of electronics and physical components beyond simply the aforementioned components. Create an initial compositional toolchain (builder/compiler) and user interface to assist in composing elements to meet demonstration goals. The compositional toolchain would notionally include a goal-seeking builder, which would assist a human designer in achieving functional goals via available components, extensions via known interfaces, or creating on-demand middleware. The middleware components would assist in adapting non-conforming hardware and software into the compositional framework (translator elements that encapsulate behavior to drive towards lower statefulness). The compositional toolchain would also include a compiler, which would take results from the builder and develop specifications or possibly produce functional equivalents that are applied to an application. Demonstrate concepts in simulation, showing accomplishment of representative reconnaissance/engineering robot and maintenance/assembly robot missions based on determined trade space.","Conduct user demonstrations of developed composable kits toward objective functions and time constraints.

Platform products, to specifically include robotic platforms, of composable design toolchains as well as flexible components would allow for affordable, marketable, and producible robotic subsystems for application to static and mobile robotic-based manufacturing, household robotics, healthcare robotics, logistics/material handling, unmanned systems, and construction robotics, to include robotics for use in hazardous environments. Design modularity would allow for module and toolchain products that could be purchased and implemented by end-users for custom applications at rapid assembly/programming paces versus developing robots, thus eliminating huge cost and time barriers. A successful development could fundamentally change the paradigm of robotics system development. Military—Composable platforms, specifically robotics as demonstrated in this effort, would have direct application to the current mission space of small reconnaissance robots for infantry units, engineering robots, mobile manipulation, explosive ordnance, and remote/unmanned needs for robots in hazardous environments. The diversity of component composition would allow for multi-mode configurations for different mission sets with the same elements (for example, wheeled maneuver recomposed for walking maneuver, then recomposed for climbing maneuver, all with the same components), while the compositional toolchain would allow for rapid and non-expert user recoding of control schemes for immediate use in such different configurations. The result would be robots that are no longer custom for a specific use, and yet are highly optimizable for multiple missions using largely the same hardware and software.",1,"S. Neema, J. Scott, T.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Direct to Phase II ONLY.","There is a critical Defense Department (DoD) need to advance the capability of guided projectiles to enable new missions and improve outcomes of current air-to-ground, ground-to-ground, and long-range ballistic missions. Guided projectiles must tightly integrate control actuation, navigation sensing and filtering, and guidance computation into a small package capable of gun-launch survivability. Electromechanical and processing demands drive the need for large subsystems, reducing volume for other projectile subsystems. A tightly integrated maneuver package would improve total packaging and performance and enable a high-performance 40 mm or smaller guided projectile. Significant advances are needed for integration of traditionally separate subsystems. By integrating chip-based navigation, guidance computation, and control electronics into a single package tightly coupled to an optimized CAS, significant volume savings could be realized. The topic objectives of the fully integrated assembly are: • Significantly reduce the overall size and weight of the CAS by identifying and evaluating optimal materials/material systems with sufficient strength-to-weight ratio for maneuver • Maximize efficiency and consolidate the assembly through refining gear-train options for the CAS • Optimize speed and torque parameters vs. power draw by selecting best configuration for the CAS motor interface • Enhance performance through aero-optimization of control-surface designs • Examine canard deployment and incorporate it if appropriate for improved system performance • Achieve in-flight course corrections through precise maneuvering of each canard by implementing a miniature four-channel positional feedback-sensing system • Develop and ensure optimal performance of a low-cost IMU with integrated GEU with reduced bias stability, angular random walk, and non-linearity of gyroscope solution • Ensure assembly survives 50,000+ g launch and environmental conditions through innovative, robust packaging and validate survivability via testing • Reduce the overall volume claim of an integrated CAS/GEU/IMU by >50 percent over the current state of the art (SOA) • Minimize latency of a combined CAS/GEU/IMU Additional optional objectives include: • Devise and demonstrate an integrated g-switch that is customized for the gun-firing g-event • Optimize power consumption on regulation/conditioning • Devise and validate performance of an innovative accelerometer This topic is ONLY interested in fully integrated solutions incorporating CAS, IMU, and GEU into a single package capable of fitting within a 40 mm or smaller projectile.

The current SOA is several small individually packaged modules connected by wire physically layered on top of each other with the empty spaces (gaps) filled with epoxy or foam. Hence, the overall package is much larger than it has to be because each module has to have its own power management, protective packaging, and shock isolation. Putting all or some of these modules on the same chip would drastically reduce space and increase performance. Inter-component data bandwidth would increase chip bus speeds and overall size could be much smaller. The fundamental components to be packaged—CAS, IMU, and GEU—already exist as individual components. The R&D challenges include integrating heterogeneous components on a chip because some of these components require more power (e.g., CAS), while others require more shock isolation (e.g., IMU) and others require a low-noise environment (e.g., radio frequency (RF) communications). Packing these components tightly together and potentially on the same chip require innovation and combining them in a compact and durable package with validation via physical testing are being sought.","Develop, test, and validate innovative material systems, components, and structures for a four-channel CAS with IMU and GEU combined in a compact and durable package with validation via physical testing. A prototype will be constructed and demonstrated to survive a high-g launch and function under high performance demands. At minimum, the assembly will demonstrate reduced packaging size, increased maximum maneuver, and reduced maneuver latency. The final Phase II deliverable will be a detailed design of the assembly and a detailed test report describing the improved performance achieved.","Commercial—Solving the integration and manufacturing challenges through the SBIR program would substantially lower integration risks that commercial receivers of the technology would face. Small GNC packages would enable a new class of ultra-small unmanned air vehicles capable of flying longer ranges for longer times on tighter paths. Tightly integrated IMU solutions have enabled current mobile device navigation. By including control and actuation, next-generation mobile devices could become truly mobile and move to suit user needs such as flying around a user for better camera angles or crawling up vertical surfaces to achieve better signals. This system could also be used on mobile devices to improve navigation in virtual simulations and drive haptic and tactile feedback to users. Military—This technology would be immediately applicable to ongoing guided projectile technology programs such as DARPA’s Multi Azimuth Defense Fast Intercept Round Engagement System (MAD-FIRES) and the U.S. Navy High Velocity Projectile (HVP). Guided projectiles have the potential to enable new missions and improve outcomes of many current missions such as air-to-ground engagements, ground-to-ground engagements, and long-range ballistic engagements.

Microbes hold promise as untapped sources of therapeutic molecules and may be leveraged for a range of industrial applications from medicine to mining. Better understanding of microbial communities would enable the manipulation of the diverse environments in which they are found. Microbial communities are increasingly appreciated as rich sources of natural products and rare metabolic activities, and as key contributors to the health and behavior of the ecosystems they inhabit. The microbial diversity of earth is estimated to be as high as 10^12 species, only 10^4 of which have been sufficiently characterized to be exploited for biotechnology. This relatively small sample of characterized species is in part due to the difficulty of cultivating most microbial species using standard culturing techniques. Technical challenges for culturing microbes include the need for specific growth environments, and a dependence of the microbes on community and host interactions, and minimal culture density. Recent successful efforts to cultivate “unculturable” species by closely mimicking natural environments in the lab have been tailored towards individual species and/or communities of interest. The positive results of these efforts illustrate the feasibility of increasing the number of cultivable species, but ultimately the approaches have been too ad hoc and labor intensive to keep pace with the growing demand for microbiome studies. DARPA seeks general experimental platforms to enable the high-throughput cultivation and functional characterization of microbial communities from a wide range of environments. The proposed solution should increase the number of unknown species that can be separated, identified, and cultivated from microbiomes by three orders of magnitude relative to standard lab techniques, such as colony growth on petri dishes. The proposed technology should also facilitate analysis of microbial community interactions, such as metabolic contributions of individual species, host interactions, and environmental factors that influence community function and behavior. As such, the proposed technology should be compatible with standard analytical techniques used to study and identify microbial species, including but not limited to next generation sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), mass spectrometry, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).",355,2539,1,No,No,No,,Develop a breadboard system to demonstrate feasibility of approach for improving yield of culturable microbes.

The state-of-the-art approach to tracking long-term viral dynamics is flask-based serial passaging, which continually transfers a small fraction of the viral output from a given flask of infected cells onto a new flask of uninfected cells. Although a powerful technique, the serial passaging method has significant limitations: low abundance viral mutants often are discarded, dilution affects cell and virus characteristics, the rate of viral evolution is prolonged, and the long-term in vivo evolutionary dynamics are not recapitulated. Maintaining appropriate cell influx and viral efflux rates in the face of viral amplification is key to recapitulating virus-host dynamics; this dynamic state is required to determine the instantaneous and steady state in virus stocks and host cell infection status (e.g., infected, uninfected, dying), which in turn is used to monitor virus mutation. One of the central challenges to overcoming these limitations is to design filters or other methods to controllably and quantitatively remove desired cells and virions. DARPA seeks to promote the design and development of new bioreactor technology to support long-term evolutionary studies for chronic infectious or non-infectious diseases. The reactor must have continuous operation and support controllable rates on influx of fresh cells and nutrient media and the separation and removal of viral particles and different types of cells without clogging or fouling. Removed particles and cells must be sorted by their type. The reactor must support operation for sustained periods of time (minimum of 45-90 days). The system must support controlled “sampling” of the reactor contents one or more times per day. The sample should be unbiased and support additional assays of cells and supernatant such as high-throughput sequencing, molecular imaging, single cell analysis, etc. The filtering technology for removal and sorting should be characterized and validated. Designs should leverage advances in microfluidics, continuous flow, novel filtration mechanisms, or other relevant technologies.

The increasing number and size of data archives has stockpiled vast quantities of information. While the extent of archiving is viewed positive, the retrieval tools enabling rapid survey and use of the archived information have not kept pace. This data explosion opens new opportunities to extract more value from data collected by the military, academia and industry. According to research by MGI and McKinsey’s Business Technology Office, big data analysis is becoming the key basis of competition due to the increasing volume and detail of information captured by enterprises, multimedia, social media and the internet. In the commercial sector, big data can be transformative through the collection of product performance, consumer and market trend information. The ability to cultivate, analyze and display this information as meaningful output will enable organizations to make decisions regarding future investment areas. The endeavor of making archives useful, is still underdeveloped. Search engines are one of the major strategies to cull through archived data, but only yield lists of information. Search engines do not enable the user to rapidly understand the topics embedded within the archive nor make connections between topics. Some content management tools that can search for keywords and return a list of matching files are available, but often require the user to know precisely what they are seeking. These tools fail to enable the user to explore the data archive in an organized approach. These aforementioned liabilities are particularly acute for archival systems designed to meet security requirements. The tools that have been developed to parse and search through large datasets have not been able to incorporate growing datasets and provide applicable, useful information using visualization techniques that achieve the desired level of interactivity. A software tool that can adapt to datasets of different volumes and compositions, provide the user with the desired output and implement visualization techniques that make the system accessible is needed to deal with the rapid increase in archived data. Tools that can analyze and produce output that displays patterns, connections and actionable information for the user will be increasingly useful. The proposed system would create a collaborative platform that is not only content-rich, intuitive, and useful, but also widely applicable and customizable.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I ONLY.,"There is a critical DoD need to develop a method for identifying, intercepting, and interposing known functional code blocks and libraries in mobile applications without altering the functionality and data flows of the targeted application. Mobile devices and their applications are increasingly relied upon by DoD. The security controls available for the most popular platforms do not always align with DoD requirements and policies. Rather than develop a new proprietary mobile platform, it is desirable to leverage existing platforms to the maximum extent possible and to add the necessary controls by controlling the application distribution channels. The goal is to produce a framework that can identify, intercept, inspect, and instrument known libraries and code blocks, including code that describes user actions, environmental sensing, and system events among others. The ability to identify code blocks and instrument them based on the application package should be transparent and should not interfere with the application functionality and data consumed or produced by the application itself. Modified applications would then be delivered to managed handsets through appropriate means, e.g., a DoD-only application store. All popular mobile platforms are of interest, with a particular emphasis on iOS and Android. Proposers may focus on a single platform, and need not consider the application distribution channel as part of their proposed effort. The code interposition framework should be able to instrument all paths through the identified set of code blocks within the targeted application using static analysis of the binary and managed code of the mobile application. At later phases of the project, dynamic analysis could be used to ensure that all potential paths have been instrumented and to intercept known code blocks if they are introduced during runtime. One of the challenges is that the application may be presented as a packaged binary which may be heavily obfuscated or may employ anti-debugging and integrity checking techniques; any proposed solution must address such challenges, and proposers must clearly articulate their approach to doing so. The framework should also be able to handle unobfuscated complex applications using interfaces to native code. In case of inability to analyze or instrument the application binary, the framework may be able to use less optimal instrumentation points by instrumenting code entry and exit points to the code that is being obfuscated. It is envisioned that the system will use both dynamic analysis and static analysis so that it is not bound by the limitations that are inherent in using only one approach. The system should provide some guarantee of adequate code coverage of the applications that it processes without creating significant overhead when processing a set of applications. Chandler et al. [1] and Binder et al. [2] have proposed different techniques that can achieve bytecode instrumentation, by inserting additional instructions in Java bytecode using multiple techniques. Dynamic analysis has the limitation of ensuring adequate code coverage and the analyzed application may display different behavior if it detects being executed in a controlled environment. DARPA needs a framework to utilize both static analysis and dynamic analysis to help overcome the shortcomings of each approach and augment each other for a more comprehensive analysis.",520,3443,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a feasibility study to determine innovative cyber techniques and mechanisms that can be used within a methodology to identify, intercept, and interpose known functional code blocks and libraries in mobile applications without altering the functionality and data flows of the target application. Design, prototype, and evaluate the resulting concept framework capable of using code interposition on mobile application binary and managed code based on known functional code blocks and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The initial prototype may simply instrument code entry and exit points to the obfuscated code. As part of Phase I, a test case with success criteria for the mobile application should be defined. Phase I deliverables will include a final report that details initial prototype design and concept framework, and preliminary results of the test case.","Fully develop the Phase I concept framework, and include both static and dynamic analysis to ensure that all potential paths have been instrumented and to intercept known code blocks if they are introduced during run-time. The system should provide some guarantee of adequate code coverage while keeping runtime overhead to a minimum. The initial prototype capability developed will support multiple techniques for testing the efficacy of the resulting code interposition framework. The resulting prototype will be demonstrated in accordance with the demonstration success criteria developed in Phase I. Phase II deliverables will include a working prototype and final report that details demonstration results.","This dual-use technology applies to both military and commercial environments affected by cyber adversaries. Commercial benefits include increased cyber warfare protection of infiltration of a company’s perimeter/network through mobile devices, and thus, increased protection of critical infrastructure environments (e.g., health, electrical, transportation, etc.). In addition, the developed framework may be commercialized for use with a mobile device that interfaces with a commercial enterprise level system that can be used to detect heavily obfuscated or anti-debugging and integrity checking techniques employed by a cyber intruder. The DoD and the commercial world have similar challenges with respect to maintaining the integrity of their cyber computing and communications infrastructure. The DoD is concerned both about in-house and third-party (commercial) mobile devices in existence today and being able to effectively detect the cyber intruder within operational systems that support the warfighter. The resulting code interposition framework for mobile applications that can identify, intercept, inspect, and instrument known libraries and code blocks, including code that describes user actions, environmental, and system events, with a DoD-only application store is directly transitionable to the DoD for use by the services (e.g., Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSC), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)).",1,"Walter Binder, Jarle Hulaas, and Philippe Moret. 2007.

Computational models and tools for representing and analyzing the human dimensions of security should be used as part of a broader verification process to assess a cyber ecosystem’s overall security. Assessments of cyber ecosystem security that integrate an understanding of human capabilities and behaviors will result in more accurate decisions regarding whether a system is adequate for specific applications, and will help guide remediation efforts such as the development of security policy modifications, personnel training plans, and specific technological countermeasures. Risk assessment for conventional cyber security focuses on formally proving that software has no vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows or cross-site scripting) and/or systematically testing with less formal verification processes (e.g., assessing architectural design and known software vulnerabilities through scans, performing analysis of static/dynamic code). Other cyber security efforts focus on creating computing hardware that resists various forms of exploitation. However, even when software and hardware vulnerabilities are eliminated, the interaction of humans with that software and hardware can lead to new and unexpected vulnerabilities. The range of relevant forms of human interaction with a system is broad, spanning not only the end-users of systems, but also system and network administrators, policy makers, system designers, malicious actors external or internal to the organization, as well as the various types of behaviors exhibited by each. Securing an overall cyber ecosystem must therefore address the potential for vulnerabilities that could be introduced from across all forms of human interaction with the system. If the human capabilities and behaviors that exist within a cyber ecosystem could be accurately represented in computational form, the security of any such system could be rapidly assessed during and after development. This effort will develop a modeling framework that supports integration of diverse data sources from the cyber domain and inferred human capabilities and properties (e.g., psycho-social factors, patterns of life, cognitive and perceptual factors) to enable the creation of models of human behavior within the cyber ecosystem, as well as the rigorous validation of such models. The models should reflect a wide range of vulnerabilities, ranging from the unintentional and careless to dedicated adversarial behaviors. The effort must include modeling human behavior beyond the user interface—the goal is not to merely confirm the functionality of the user interface, but rather the inherent complexity found when multiple humans are interacting in a variety of ways with a system and each other. This effort will marry research in modeling human behavior with formal security analysis methods to identify system vulnerabilities that are “reachable” given varying levels of human intentional and unintentional behavior. One result of this work will be an assessment of the likely risk of activating the human-associated vulnerability for a system and its operational policies. This approach will provide additional and immediate benefits through the assignment of monitoring resources, training, improvements to cyber technologies, and/or revisions in security policies to improve resilience against the highest value threats.",533,3765,1,No,No,No,,"Prototype a framework for assessing overall security of a cyber ecosystem by combining models of human behavior with models of cyber infrastructure (software, security systems, security policy).

Commercial organizations generally face a more difficult security risk situation due to lack of control and influence over both their members and the hardware and software systems they use.

Please see the 17.1 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 17.1 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.,"There is a critical national security need to understand the priorities of other governments, a task that is particularly difficult when dealing with opaque, authoritarian systems. The U.S. has important relationships with countries that engage in information control practices (e.g., restricting freedom of the press), which make discerning the policy goals of leadership difficult. Policy discussions are not held in public forums, official statements tend to be broad or vague, and local media is frequently subject to strict publication limitations. However, regimes that exert great effort in managing the flow of information also tend to engage in similar and complementary information control practices online. The Internet has provided many platforms to share news and ideas in an unregulated manner, even in countries where the information environment is closely regulated. Government efforts to control the flow of information online (via tactics such as censorship, sock-puppeting, and/or astroturfing) leave an imprint that can be measured and interpreted as a representation of which topics or people are considered important to those in power. Comprehensively tracking systematic efforts to control information is a significant technological challenge, particularly in the diverse, voluminous, shifting, and multilingual online environment. To accurately track online interventions, the action of foreign governments must be studied at high speeds and on large scales with multiple algorithms designed to consistently detect online intervention and correlate trends, given that “ground truth” - by design - is hidden. To make sense of the signal at scale, these algorithms will require automated text analytic techniques tailored to the target language, baselining and trend detection methodologies, topic modeling, and regional or sub-national analysis. This effort seeks to develop an ensemble of generalizable approaches and associated algorithms for detection of online interventions in discourse – and is focused on text (although extensions that address audio, imagery, and/or video are not excluded). Generalizing approaches is challenging, given the need to accommodate: (1) different and dynamic languages and media consumption patterns; (2) ongoing changes in a foreign government’s topical interests and tactics; and (3) the wide variety of means by which information flows online. This effort will include the identification and/or extraction of publicly available information from foreign online media and social networking sites that contains one or more signals created by the online intervention of foreign governments. Identification and extraction efforts are difficult for a variety of reasons, including the multitude of forums to monitor, the need to identify posts in near-real time to ensure they are collected before they are altered or removed, and the need to systematically separate relevant content from irrelevant content that might be altered or removed (e.g., spam). Successful implementation will depend on two aspects working in harmony: (1) comprehensive data identification and/or extraction infrastructure adaptable to different regions; and (2) robust and regionally sensitive post-collection analysis. The effort will ensure compliance with all relevant policies and regulations on the protection of human subjects in research.",483,3379,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a system design concept to identify, extract, and analyze one type of online intervention in a single country, including the infrastructure for obtaining and analyzing at least two sources of anonymized, foreign social media data.

Capabilities have been demonstrated to monitor PAI and analyze sentiment, attitudes about specific topics, as well as group properties such as organizational structure, cohesion, and extra-group affiliations. Such attributes can and have been used to monitor the shifting attitudes of groups through their exhibited behavior in social networking environments and other online forums in which such information is openly published. However, a key remaining challenge is determining if exhibited behavior in PAI that appears to have some characteristics of threat behavior actually represents a real threat, or merely some other purpose (venting, appearing agreeable to an affiliated group, etc.). That is, it is a challenge to assess not only if expressed beliefs or attitudes are sincere, but also whether those beliefs or attitudes are a likely source of intentionality and action. This challenge is made more difficult by the potential for a group to act covertly or to practice deception. This effort will pursue the ability to accurately detect and predict a group’s intention to act within expressive behavior in PAI. This effort will consider intention as a phenomenon distinct from attitude or belief expressions themselves. Preference will be given to approaches that hold promise of resilience across differing sources of PAI (e.g., different social networking environments, online news), languages, cultures, and topics.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 17.1 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 17.1 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.,"There is a critical DoD need to reduce the volume and weight of high power RF transmitter systems. The power supply is a key component of the transmitter. This solicitation seeks to develop the enabling technologies to significantly reduce the footprint and weight of power supplies for transmitters based on vacuum electronic amplifiers and to demonstrate innovative power supply architectures in a relevant application. Vacuum electronic (VE) amplifiers such as traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) often are the technology of choice for transmitter applications requiring operation with high power-bandwidth product performance at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. A high voltage power supply/modulator (HVPS/Mod) provides the conditioned voltages and currents to the TWT and is a critical component of the transmitter system. Typically, the HVPS/Mod consists of a cathode supply, heater power supply for the thermionic electron gun, a modulating anode or grid supply to gate the electron beam on and off, and supplies to bias multiple depressed collector stages in a topology that enables true energy recovery of the spent electron beam for overall system efficiency enhancement. Increasingly, constraints on platform size and available prime power are placing challenges on the volume, weight, and efficiency of the HVPS/Mod. This topic seeks the development and demonstration of new HVPS/Mod topologies and components to significantly reduce the HVPS/Mod system SWaP (size, weight, and power requirements) and to increase the power density up to 1 Watt/cm^3 (>3x the current state-of-the-art). Innovative architectures that can exploit higher switching speeds with low losses are desirable as are the development and incorporation of new materials and components such as (but not limited to) high speed, high voltage solid-state switches and rectifiers; high frequency, high saturation field, low-loss magnetics; compact, high voltage capacitors that can tolerate high ripple currents ; compact high voltage connectors; improved high voltage dielectrics; and improved high voltage packaging and encapsulation. The overall topic goal is to demonstrate innovative power supply architectures for applications in RF transmitter systems and to develop the enabling technologies to significantly reduce the volume and weight. To provide a focus for the development, the specific performance goals for this topic are a cathode voltage and current of 20 kV and 1.5 A, respectively; 100% duty operation; a maximum modulating anode voltage swing of -3 kV (beam off) to +1.5 kV (beam on) with respect to the cathode voltage; cathode heater DC power of 12 V and 5 A with respect to cathode voltage; and up to four stages of depressed collectors for energy recovery with a goal of reducing the prime power requirement to approximately one third of the beam power.",430,2856,1,No,No,No,,"Conceptualize and design an innovative HVPS/Mod architecture with a power density of up to 1 W/cm^3 and capable of meeting program performance goals. These goals include a cathode voltage and current of 20 kV and 1.5 A, respectively; 100% duty operation; a maximum modulating anode voltage swing of -3 kV (beam off) to +1.5 kV (beam on) with respect to the cathode voltage; cathode heater DC power of 12 V and 5 A with respect to cathode voltage; and up to four stages of depressed collectors for energy recovery with a goal of reducing the prime power requirement to approximately one third of the beam power. The overall HVPS/Mod power-added efficiency should exceed 85%. Key components and enabling technologies will be investigated, assessed, and identified for incorporation in the design. Phase I deliverables include the HVPS/Mod electrical design and preliminary mechanical design, the identification of innovative component technologies, and a plan for their development and implementation.","Develop, fabricate, and demonstrate a prototype HVPS/Mod based on the Phase I work. Finalize electrical and mechanical engineering designs. As necessary, developmental components and sub-assemblies will be tested and validated. A series of laboratory tests will demonstrate that the prototype hardware meets the power density and electrical performance goals set out in Phase I. Phase II deliverables include all HVPS/Mod hardware and a report documenting test results and innovative component development.","Vacuum electronics is a critical defense technology. At present, over 80% of the microwave and millimeter-wave transmitters in fielded DoD systems are based on vacuum electronic amplifiers and oscillators. Compact high voltage power supply/modulators are a key component for all of these systems and are a critical enabling technology for future applications on land, air, sea, and space-based platforms. These applications include jam resistant high data rate digital communication systems capable of operation in adverse environmental conditions, high resolution radar with extended range, and high power, broad bandwidth transmitters for electronic attack. The HVPS/Mod architectures and advances in innovative component technologies resulting from the Phase I and II research will enable new systems with significantly lower SWaP compared with the current state-of-the-art. Commercial applications would also benefit from reductions in HVPS/Mod SWaP. For example, the reduced volume and weight would enable higher power transmitters to be mounted directly on ground-based antenna feeds resulting in lower system losses and increased range of operation. Furthermore, the technology could be used in satellite communications. Over 90% of the geosynchronous communications satellites use TWT amplifiers. Reductions in the size and weight of the power supply/modulators would have immediate benefits. For example, reduced SWaP would allow the inclusion of more amplifiers on a given satellite to increase channel capacity and/or improve reliability, or reduce the overall size and weight of the satellite to minimize launch costs.",1,"S.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 17.1 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 17.1 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.,"There is a critical DoD need to develop “recommender” systems that process data based on streaming rather than static feature sets to more intelligently automate big data analysis and cue pertinent information for analysts and planners. Recommender systems have been a staple of many recent successful businesses including Netflix’s movie suggestions and Amazon’s product recommendations. They are also rapidly emerging in many other fields such as personal health recommendation and can similarly be expected to play a larger role in intelligence analysis and command and control functions of Department of Defense (DoD). For example, such a system could help an analyst cue-in on critical aspects of an image, or serve as a virtual decision-aide in the construction of courses of action during mission planning. These systems typically work by identifying trends or patterns in data to associate past behavior with future tendencies. For example, based on a given user’s past movie history rankings and what their friends rated highly, a recommender system can generate a short list of movie suggestions that the user will most likely want to watch next. A critical piece of such functionality depends on the features that describe the data; from the above example they would include a user’s movie rating history, network of friends, movie genre, etc. In the past, recommender system designers would hand tune this set of features and it would remain static for months or years, but this approach ignores many other potentially beneficial features that could be found from available data. Consider the problem of recommending articles posted on social media websites. Typical features would consist of a predefined set of words and topics; however, the language of social media changes frequently. New slang words and event-driven topics may greatly alter the meaning of articles; recommender systems built on fixed feature sets without these words may be unable to keep up with current trends and fail to meet user expectations. This is an example of the need to incorporate streaming features – new words in this example – to improve recommender system performance.",342,2170,1,No,No,No,,Identify one or more relevant data sources and recommendation targets applicable to those sources. Design an algorithmic approach to enable a recommender system to take advantage of streaming features produced by the identified data source(s).

Evaluate the proposed recommender system against recommender systems that use only static (non-streaming) feature subsets to demonstrate potential gains to be achieved by using streaming features. Phase II deliverables must include a prototype software implementation of the algorithm as well as a final report that documents the software, system design, and evaluation results.","This effort has the potential to enable several resilient recommender systems to be developed as virtual decision-aides for defense systems (tipping and queuing for intelligence analysts, course of action planning in command and control processes, etc.); and may have a broad impact in the commercial sector (improved product recommendations, tailored newsfeeds, personalized health plans, etc.).",1,"X.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I and DP2. Please see the 17.1 DoD Program Solicitation and the DARPA 17.1 Direct to Phase II Instructions for DP2 requirements and proposal instructions.,"There is a critical DoD need to develop and demonstrate an adaptive optical beam control system optimized for use with high energy, ultra-short pulse lasers and propagation in non-linear media such as the atmosphere. USPL pulses propagating through a non-linear medium such at the atmosphere undergo self-focusing due to the non-linear interaction between the high-peak-power optical field and the propagation medium[1], and may undergo other non-linear optical interactions, for example (but not limited to) Raman or Brillouin scattering. DARPA is interested in developing adaptive optics which enable precise beam control of non-linear optical beam propagation in uncontrolled turbulent and non-linear media, in particular in the atmosphere. The propagation of high-peak power short pulses is influenced by the spatial, spectral and temporal profile of the pulse.[2] Therefore, “adaptive optics” in this announcement is extended to include or interface with methods of dynamic manipulation of the spectral and temporal profile of the laser pulse as a secondary or augmented capability. The adaptive optical system to be designed shall include a method of spatial wavefront correction (e.g. deformable mirror (DM)), a spatial wavefront sensor (WFS), a diagnostic method of closed-loop feedback (such as a guide beacon), and a closed-loop control system with control software and user interface. The system shall be designed to accommodate short pulse lasers with pulse energies up to 1J, pulse lengths varying from 100fs to 100ps, and peak power levels of 10-1000 GW. The system should be compatible with operation in the near-IR (~0.8-1.1µm), short-wave infrared (1.3-2.5µm), and/or the mid-wave infrared (3.5-4.2µm). The wavefront correction components should be capable of dynamically correcting moderate to high spatial frequency scales such as those expected for optical propagation through a turbulent atmosphere. DARPA desires near-diffraction-limited correction of wavefront errors with spatial frequency less than or equal to 6/(clear aperture), in a clear aperture of 2-8 cm, at rates >100Hz, with a peak-to-valley dynamic range of 6 microns excluding full-aperture tilt. This is approximately equivalent to an ability to compensate for up to the sixth order of aberrations in Zernike polynomials. A means of diagnostic feedback to the closed-loop wavefront control is an important part of the system. It can be assumed for the purpose of this effort that the transmitted USPL pulse will be brought to a self-focus at a predetermined distance. The high-peak-power USPL pulse will experience distortions of non-linear effects during propagation that would not happen to a lower power beam propagating through the same medium when the USPL pulse is not present. Therefore there is special interest in AO methods which utilize measurements of the USPL focus viewed from the launch aperture location as a diagnostic source. This is a significant departure from traditional AO systems which rely on direct wavefront sensing and reciprocal symmetry of the propagation path. However, systems which utilize independent wavefront measurements of the linear propagation paths, or other methods, are acceptable if they can obtain some degree of sensing and correction of the non-linear propagation path[4]. Novel control solutions such as “sensorless” methods[3] are of interest to address this issue. In addition, the propagation of a USPL pulse in a non-linear medium can be altered by changing the spectral/temporal profile of the pulse. In atmospheric propagation, for example, analog modulation of the spectral or temporal profile is desired with resolution of 1/10 (or less) of the spectral or temporal width. Consequently, AO closed-loop methods that can interface with spectral/temporal pulse control systems and can utilize such spectral/temporal controls in open- or closed-loop coordination with spatial wavefront control are of particular interest.",587,3960,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a detailed description of the adaptive optical system, including wavefront measurement methods and sensors, wavefront correction methods and materials, and control system methods and algorithms. This description should include a performance estimation of residual wavefront error, closed-loop bandwidth, and a preliminary evaluation of the expected size, weight, and power consumption of a complete prototype system implementation. The Phase I design description should address the ability of the proposed approach to accommodate ultrashort pulsed power levels of up to 100 GW and up to 1J of pulse energy. In addition, the Phase 1 effort should address the control-system approach and provide an analytic validation that the proposed approach can converge to a desired solution in the presence of non-linear optical effects. Phase I deliverables will include a Kickoff Meeting briefing, monthly technical and financial status reports, a Final Review briefing and a narrative Final Report.","Demonstrate the Phase I concept via brassboard experiments. In Phase II, a Phase I concept will be reduced to practice at full scale, and its performance validated in a laboratory setting. The experiments conducted should result in empirical and/or analytic knowledge that may be used to further optimize and/or upgrade the system to a prototype AO system. The laboratory brassboard must provide characterization data that demonstrate by analysis that the performance objectives can be met. It is expected that the brassboard system with minor modifications could be subsequently utilized in a field experiment that would directly meet the performance objectives in the atmosphere. Phase II deliverables will include a Kickoff Meeting briefing, monthly technical and financial status reports, a System Requirements Review briefing and report, an Experiment Plan, a Final Review briefing and a narrative Final Report.","AO systems capable of providing beam control for non-linear optical beams may find military applications in high-energy laser systems and in standoff chemical identification systems.

In order to achieve manufacturing and maintenance cost savings as well as weight reduction, structural concepts for a load-bearing thermally protected structure are needed. Structural concepts for hybrid thermal protection systems (TPS) and hot structure components, including leading edges, aerodynamically heated remaining structure, and control surfaces are sought to improve on the state-of-art. The current state of the art in hypersonic structures faces two technical challenges: environmental durability and fabrication; additionally, weight penalty is incurred since the TPS is parasitic and not load-bearing.

This new technology would reduce their launch system weights. Similarly, but in its early stages, commercial firms are also beginning to explore the business case for both supersonic and hypersonic commercial aircraft. DOD/Military Applications - Weight on the back end of next generation fighter aircraft needs to be reduced for the aircraft to reach the range needed in the future. Increased thermal loads from thermally isolated engines can also lead to early structural failure (O&M issues) and weight issues.

One of the major challenges when operating a TBCC engine is obtaining stable mode transition while achieving the required performance and operability over the entire flight range. During this process, a successful propulsion control and actuation system must: (1) avoid inlet and/or engine unstart [1], (2) mitigate low-/high-speed inlet/engine interactions, (3) account for backpressure and moving-structure positioning effects, and (4) deliver optimal vehicle performance. [2] Current sensors suffer from an inability to survive the hypersonic environment and provide reliable, distributed data such as pressure, temperature, heat flux, shear, displacement, flow velocity/Mach number, etc. Current sensors do not integrate well into hypersonic vehicle structures—whether they are high-strength metal alloys or hot ceramic structures—for a variety of reasons.

PROPOSALS ACCEPTED: Phase I ONLY.","There is a critical DoD need to promote the development of means of tracking and characterization of space objects beyond the limitations of our current optical and radar-based methods. This need can be fulfilled by a collaborative RF-based tracking architecture, with a primary focus on an innovative, small, lightweight RFID or extremely low-power electronic device. Such a device should be suitable for installation and operation on spacecraft or rocket upper stages, and be capable of transmitting a unique identification code either upon RF interrogation, or in a systematic fashion consistent with its design architecture. In addition, this device should transmit position information and telemetry that provides an indication of the object’s state of health (perhaps based on angular velocity or changes therein). The device should operate independently from the host object, and should not require power or data from the host. It should be small and lightweight, so as to minimize the impact on the host object’s operations and other systems. The device should have an operational lifetime comparable to the on-orbit duration of the host object, which may vary from months to decades depending on the host platform. A systematic means of interrogation and data transmission from the device to the ground should be explored. Due to the rapid expansion in the number of space objects, space situational awareness provided by traditional, externally derived radar and optical measurements will likely become inadequate for purposes of identification and tracking. A variety of proposals are being discussed to provide a measure of space traffic control under a common authority. Current methods are resource-intensive and prone to errors and misidentifications. For example, multi-satellite launches lead to persistent misidentification of objects launched, and maneuvering satellites are difficult to identify when reacquired by a tracking station. A more robust method is envisioned for identification and tracking of space objects that is collaborative with the objects, paralleling the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in the maritime domain or the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system in the airborne domain. With variants of this device attached to future spacecraft and other space objects, future space traffic management systems would be able to continuously monitor space traffic, even through orbital maneuvers and gaps in tracking coverage.

Some of the main limitations with current electronics for neurophysiological studies are the size and cost of traditional equipment for neurophysiology studies. Large digital signal processing boxes [1] have enabled large-scale recordings of neural activity in the brain and recent efforts to miniaturize these electronics have yielded successful research products [2]. While clinically available [3] systems have been developed, the number of channels in these systems is comparatively low. There has been significant academic research addressing portions of this need [4-8], but none of this research has provided a complete system ready for commercial distribution. Next-generation neural systems will require bidirectional, real-time communication of high-bandwidth neural signals into and out of the body. Current neural interfaces tend to focus on input (stimulation only) or output (recording only) from the physiological system. As the field of bioelectronic medicine matures, the need to have bidirectional systems that provide closed-loop stimulation (diagnose, analyze, then stimulate accordingly) will require electronics that are capable of recording and stimulating simultaneously. Proposals must develop a compact and flexible bidirectional system that addresses all components of C-SWaP (cost, size, weight, and power). The goal is to move processing power from traditional large, bench-top processing boxes to smaller electronics on (or close to) the site of recording on the animal (i.e., a headstage), including multiplexing functionality that reduces lead-count in the wire bundle connecting head-stage to benchtop instrumentation. The headstage electronics must be compact and lightweight, providing a high throughput data ""pipe"" to enable high channel count recording and stimulation (minimum of 32 channels per headstage). The system architecture should be flexible and scalable to further increase the channel count and support multiple types of biological data (brain, peripheral nerve, muscle, etc.). The goal is to shift processing power and technology closer to the biological specimen, improve the quality of signal, and lower the overall cost and bulk of the equipment to perform large-scale neurophysiological experiments. Solutions may require real-time analysis capabilities and firmware upgradability to add new capabilities. The device should be intended for pre-clinical research in animals. In addition to C-SWaP, efforts need to account for reliability and manufacturability. Systems and architectures need to account for methods to reliably attach to various electrode(s) and, if the system is to be wired, an external connector. The design should account for relevant environmental stressors to enable robust operation in freely behaving animal experiments. In order to demonstrate a viable prototype by the end of this SBIR, all aspects of system development enabling a functional prototype must be addressed: application programming interfaces for stimulation and recording, data transfer and power, power usage, size, weight, cost to fabricate, encapsulation, thermal budget under operating conditions, design for operation in a realistic environment (e.g., EMI, simulated mechanical behavior, etc.). The design of electronics may require safety features, bioelectric amplification, DAC/ADC, signal processing, operational reconfigurability, true stimulation charge balancing, stimulation artifact immunity/rejection, noise levels (<0.5 uVRMS), onboard memory storage (pseudo wireless), and/or other features that would enable the design to be highly scalable to support high channel count devices. Additional features may include data compression or analysis functions implemented on the headstage.",548,3943,1,No,No,No,,"Develop preliminary design concept and architecture to determine technological feasibility of a low-power, scalable, flexible bidirectional system for pre-clinical animal use. The component must support capabilities for simultaneous stimulation and recording on each headstage, with flexible and rapid reconfigurability. Neural recording instrumentation must be suitable for measuring various types of bioelectrical signals, including compound and single unit action potentials in peripheral nerve, muscle, and field potentials and action potentials (multi and single unit) in the central nervous system. Stimulation control should offer the resolution and range needed for neural stimulation in these various structures. The proposed electronics must be scalable to enable high channel count (1000+ channels) recording, with a minimum of 32 channels per headstage. Systems need to be lightweight and compact to enable placement very near or on the animal. While the system or platform needs to record from a subset of nerves, brain, spinal cord, and muscle, the specific architecture should enable successful recordings from all structures. Architectures could include an all-in-one solution, a modular design, or other possibilities. A particular electrode technology or connector/link to external equipment is not mandated, but the system design should include specific choices and support for particular electrode(s) and wired connector(s) or link(s). Plans need to include specific methods to connect electrodes and, if applicable, a connector to an external system. Technology feasibility needs to include anticipated specifications (e.g., noise floor, power, heat, size, cost, resolution/step size, etc.) and needs to address the inherent issues of electrical recording neural/muscle waveforms simultaneously with electrical stimulation of neural structures. System noise and power consumption parameters must be defined and quantitatively estimated. In addition, detailed system properties and assumptions need to be defined/supported including, but not limited to: self-test capability to ensure system, electrode, and insulation integrity; tissue heating; and power usage. Error detection and correction capabilities should be assessed where relevant. Efforts should prepare plans for testing in vivo to verify full functionality for bioelectrical recording and stimulation. The Phase I deliverable is a final report that must include : a) modeling and simulations of expected performance; b) modeling and simulations of the effect of relevant biological components on package and electrode interfaces; c) target animal species; d) competitive assessment; and, e) system performance metrics, plans, and a timeline for the systems to be designed and constructed in Phase II. Optimizing usability with multiple neural interfaces or connectors will be considered an additional attractive feature. Plans for Phase II should include preliminary design goals and key technological milestones to enable pre-clinical testing and evaluation. Phase I should account for time to submit and process all required animal use protocols as appropriate. For this topic, DARPA will accept proposals for work and cost up to $225,000 for Phase I. The preferred structure is a $175,000 base period, up to 12 months period of performance, and a $50,000, 4-month option period. Alternative structures may be accepted if sufficient rationale is provided.","Develop and demonstrate a prototype system based on the preliminary design from Phase I. All appropriate engineering and testing will be performed. A critical design review will be performed to finalize the design. Particular emphasis will be placed upon prototype size, weight, power, cost, functionality, scalability, flexibility, and the ability to reliably record neural/muscle data simultaneously with neural stimulation. Phase II deliverables will include: (1) a working prototype of the system, including expected life-cycle capabilities; (2) test data on its performance collected in one or more pre-clinical models; (3) test data to ensure compliance with relevant regulations from FDA, FCC, IEC, or other organizations for use in animals, or potentially humans; and (4) projections for manufacturing yield and costs. Phase II should account for time to submit and process all required animal and/or human subjects use protocols as appropriate.","An end goal of this effort is to provide a new commercial platform/device(s) to conduct basic research or pre-clinical neural engineering, biomechanical, neuroscience, or neuromodulation research.

Projects focusing on mosquito production are discouraged from applying.","There is a DoD need to improve production systems to produce insects for food or feed, agricultural release, or entomological research in an effort to mitigate threats to agriculture stability and develop alternative methods of producing nutrients or other bio-synthesized products. Insects currently provide crucial “ecosystem services” including natural pest suppression and pollination that are under increasing strain from environmental and anthropogenic disturbance. In contrast, advances in synthetic biology provide future opportunities to bolster these roles, or create entirely new insect-delivered services altogether. Achievement of these goals will require large numbers of specific insect species to be produced at a scale that is currently difficult because of system bottlenecks. If these bottlenecks could be overcome, managed insect production could play a large and important role in ensuring national security through stabilization of food security or the provisioning of other essential services delivered by insects. Insects are the dominant animal group on the planet, and many species are accordingly vital to the provisioning of natural capital in support of the human economy. These so-called “ecosystem services” may be calculated as the value of the services lost if insects were to disappear. Using this method, Losey and Vaugh (2006) valued wild insect ecosystem services in the United States, including pollination, pest suppression, nutrient cycling, and recreational opportunities, at no less than $57 billion USD per year. Debates continue as to the accuracy and ethics of assigning values to natural services, but few can argue that a world without insects would struggle and perhaps fail to support human economies as we know them today. The opportunity to positively affect large-scale managed insect production requires technological advances to overcome the bottlenecks created by the feeding media or substrate, labor, post-processing, quality control, and insufficient capital to generate efficiencies of scale (Cohen et al. 1999, Grenier 2009). Many insect species, especially those used for pest control, have relatively inflexible dietary demands in terms of nutritional quality, and some natural enemy species require only certain animal species as hosts. Insect bodies are fragile, and have generally been handled by humans during husbandry and packaging, a time-consuming and often expensive endeavor. Artificial rearing sometimes produces poor quality results; for example, it can yield insects with low nutritional value or that are unable to function in the environment upon release. Too often, existing solutions are expensive, thus triggering a vicious cycle where the insect product is not economical enough to attract the very capital expansion investment that would reduce the cost-per-unit to sustainable levels. Accordingly, innovative solutions to these problems of rearing valuable insect species en masse would prove immensely valuable. Opportunities abound to improve rearing success on artificial diets, increase automation of husbandry and processing, improve quality control, and reduce cost-to-entry barriers of novel or existing technologies that overcome the most common insect rearing hurdles. Improved genetic, genomic, and proteomic understanding and editing tools allows enhanced diet optimization on both the production (nutritional) and consumption (insect) ends of the pipeline. Vast improvements in sensors, robotics, and computing have already allowed a nascent, automated plant-farming industry to form, and similar technologies could be developed or transferred to insect rearing and processing methods. Plummeting costs in an array of molecular techniques and specialized production platforms encourage a re-evaluation of formerly cost-prohibitive processes or a re-imagination of new ones. Removing or reducing barriers to the efficient, economical, and effective production of valuable insect species could be used to improve agricultural production, deliver novel sources of nutrition, and protect necessary ecosystem services. Innovative engineering, bio-synthetic, and/or genetic/genomic strategies will be required to improve the output, quality, and viability of large-scale insect rearing needed to meet these goals. This SBIR topic seeks approaches to identify and address issues associated with large-scale insect rearing and/or the improvement of production outcomes. We encourage applications that use emerging engineering and genetic/genomic tools to these ends. Expected outcomes could be: rapid assessment and/or production of successful artificial diets; improved rearing efficiency and/or scale through the use of automation, strategies, or machines to rapidly assess insect quality or delicately handle live insects for post-processing; and materials or methods to speed return on investment during the scaling-up process.",690,4918,1,No,No,No,,"Identify engineering objectives, molecular targets, or innovative strategies for improving production and performance of insects to improve large-scale rearing operations. Individual projects should address at least one of several challenges expected, which include: (1) artificial insect diet success, (2) increased efficiency and automation, (3) improved quality control and post-processing, (4) materials or methods to significantly improve rates of return on creating economies of scale. Example approaches could include the following: • Artificial diets for difficult-to-produce or especially valuable beneficial insect species. • Engineering advances in insect rearing facilities to increase energy, materials, and/or labor efficiency. • Methods, sensors, or machines to improve insect quality and reduce post-processing time or losses. • Novel, alternative, or streamlined solutions to especially costly insect rearing facility problems. The key deliverable for Phase I will be the demonstration of a proof of concept that the selected challenge has been overcome and can be scaled to a larger format. These demonstrations should be performed in repeated experiments in small colonies (i.e., tens to hundreds of individuals) on single or multiple insect species where significant improvements in insect rearing success, efficiency, end product, or cost-per-unit can be shown to have significantly improved through relevant analysis. For this topic, DARPA will accept proposals for work and cost up to $225,000 for Phase I. The preferred structure is a $175,000, 12-month base period, and a $50,000, 4-month option period.

Therefore, the deliverable for Phase II is the demonstration of a large-scale insect production system utilizing integrated engineering, genetic, or materials technologies. Communication with the proper regulatory agencies will be a key component to determine how these technologies can be safely and ethically monitored for proper use and eventual commercialization of the anticipated product.","Phase III (Commercial): The technologies developed in Phases I and II will be integrated into a fundamental platform to improve the production of economically or environmentally valuable insect species. These integrated technologies will serve as the foundation for further improvement. Phase III will be a demonstration of a fully adopted system that utilizes two or more technologies to improve production. In addition to the development of a plan for regulatory oversight, if applicable, Phase III projects should address the challenge of encouraging human acceptance of insects and insect-derived products for human use. Phase III (Military): The integration of insect-derived products or ecosystem services (e.g., into the Combat Feeding Directorate or the Armed Forces Pest Management Board) is a potential option for technology transition. The objective of Phase III (Military) will be to determine feasibility, utility, and acceptance levels of these products and production systems by military personnel, especially in deployment scenarios.",1,"Riddick, Eric W. 2009.

Demonstrate and validate the technology for at least three distinct indications.,"There is a critical DoD need to respond effectively to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases by recognizing and responding to new outbreaks early and rapidly [1]. The advent of nucleic acid-based countermeasure technologies has been critical to addressing this need, enabling rapid synthesis, reduced cold chain needs, and decreased costs [2,3]. A significant hurdle remaining in this process are requirements that ensure clinical batch-to-batch comparability. Potency tests for nucleic acid drug products are integral to clinical development to ensure similar, expected behavior of the product when derived from various batches, manufacturers, etc. Those working in this space currently are using ad hoc systems to evaluate product potency, or even worse, not evaluating batch-to-batch potency at all. DARPA seeks to promote the design of a gene-encoded mAb potency assay that requires only minimal (if any) modifications across mAb and/or indication space. For DNA vaccines currently in the clinic, the potency test consists of transfecting cells with the DNA plasmid and using flow cytometry to determine if the transfected cells express the encoded antigen, which then triggers multiple signaling cascades to generate a protective state. For DNA- (or RNA-) encoded monoclonal antibodies, the encoded protein itself confers a protective state, and thus a potency assay based on expression alone is insufficient—the assay(s) should not only demonstrate gene expression by transfected cells but also effectively predict concentration range in the intended recipient (e.g., 40-pound child vs. 130-pound adult) and confirm that the encoded mAb(s) protein maintains desired binding and function.",247,1700,1,No,No,No,,"Develop key requirements and establish performance metrics for evaluation of the potency assay.

Optical phase filters have been designed using a variety of approaches in order to efficiently modify an incident wavefront into a spot which is tightly focused transverse to the direction of propagation. For over sixty years, attempts have been made to realize these superresolving filters, usually assuming they are thin with respect to the wavelength of operation resulting in low diffraction efficiency. Spot sizes, smaller than conventional resolution limits suggest, have been obtained but these were often at the expense of increased stray light, reduced field of view or reflections. The limits to resolution from a scattering of diffracting element have been debated over the years by Shannon, Gabor and Di Francia [1] often in terms of analytic properties of the wavefield and the number of degrees of freedom of the imaging system. The classical analysis of this problem and the inherent ill-posedness of superresolution can be found in [2] by Slepian and Pollack and one of the first papers proposing a superresolving filter was by W. Lukosz [3]. Manipulating zero crossings of a field to fashion desirable point spread functions is reasonably straightforward and the relationship between the resulting point spread function and the transmittance of the diffracting mask is well known [4]. In lithography, so-called phase-shift filters have been employed for 30 years to provide some measure of improvement in resolution [5]. Constructive - destructive interference effects can reduce the effective width of a point spread function, but the improvement is limited. A detailed study of superresolving filters was published by Morris et al [6], considering both the transverse width of the point spread function (the G parameter which is the ratio of the first zero of the superresolved point spread function, divided by the first zero of the Airy disk) and its relative intensity (the Strehl ratio: the intensity of the superresolved peak/the intensity of the Airy disk) [7]. One example approach for superresolving filter design is as follows [8]. By manipulating the zero distribution of an optical phase filter’s diffracted field, tightly focused spots are accompanied by intense sidelobes and correspondingly low intensity in the spot. A useful property of propagating and diffracted wavefields is that one can represent them by analytic functions of a complex variable. A point spread function is an analytic (entire) function of specific order and type determined by the spatial bandwidth. In the one-dimensional case, this allows a representation for the field similar to that of a polynomial, i.e. as a (Hadamard) product encoding zero locations. Asymptotically, the complex roots are equally spaced and tend to lie parallel to or on the real axis. The nature of this class of analytic functions is that one can retain the square integrable properties of such a function if one only perturbs the non-asymptotic zero locations. Thus, by manipulating these zero locations in 1D, 2D and 3D, the point spread function can be shaped to be arbitrarily narrow to form super-oscillatory wavefronts, [9-10]. Unfortunately, this analysis to date has been based upon a physical optics or weakly scattering model. A strongly scattering model is necessary and some kind of 3D or 2.5D metasurface [11] is likely needed to improve efficiency. An inverse problem has to be solved to determine the index distribution of the phase filter or metasurface in order to realize an improved design. By carefully manipulating the interference pattern generated by scattered and diffracted waves transmitted through an optical phase filter which is not necessarily thin, can one generate a spatially superresolved spot that is both light-efficient and manufacturable? What additional degrees of freedom can be usefully exploited to this end, if one includes multiple scattering in the filter and makes use of coherence and polarization properties [12-13] of the incident wave? An innovative approach to this challenging problem is sought.",660,4242,1,No,No,No,,"Design and numerically simulate the properties of an optical filter that can generate superresolved (e.g. less than tenth of a wavelength) optical spot with high throughput efficiency. The efficiency of the proposed optical phase filter must be specified along with the fundamental limits to the smallest spot size one might achieve. Also, the power handling capability of a practical filter needs to be estimated, as well as its wider angle beam properties (stray light) and field of view. The optical phase filter is anticipated to be a surface relief pattern with high transmission efficiency and ideally be free-standing. The filter should encode the spot at a known distance behind the filter and the sidelobes and depth of focus of the subwavelength spot determined. Polarization, bandwidth and coherence characteristics should be determined also. Phase I deliverable(s) will be a final report that includes the design principles used, the proposed designs for the optical phase filter and numerical simulations or theoretical models that predict the filter’s practical performance specifications. For this topic, DARPA will accept proposals for work and cost up to $150,000 for Phase I. The preferred structure is a $100,000, 6-month base period, and a $50,000, 4-month option period.","Using results from Phase I fabricate and validate a prototype. The optical filter can be designed and fabricated to operate at any or several of the specified wavelength ranges. In Phase II, filters will be fabricated and can be characterized in a 3D printing, cutting, or scribing application. The filter’s use for imaging should also be evaluated. The material choice and fabrication approach is not specified but manufacturability of a large number of these optical phase filters has to be eventually feasible at reasonable cost. Phase II deliverable(s) will include examples of optical filters and their performance specifications in one or more of the applications given above.","Multiple commercial and military products could benefit from this technology since an optical filter design could be optimized and then scaled for use at different wavelengths. Ideally, a stand-alone mask can be inserted into existing optical systems such as optical printing or machining systems. This filter may be retrofitted to 3D printers that write with lasers (e.g. Optek, 3D Systems tools, Nanoscribe) in both a military and commercial context for greater precision when producing parts or prototypes, e.g. in the battlefield or in space. Advancing this technology has potential applications for: i) Cutting and writing into materials which absorb optical wavelengths; medical and industrial applications come to mind (e.g. chip trimming, ablation or erasure of material with high precision) ii) Optical imaging with the superresolved spot as a probe iii) Reading and writing with optical storage media iv) As a means to produce a highly focused and higher power laser spot by direct use of the filter in a laser cavity (e.g. external cavity laser or direct fabrication onto the end of a fiber laser). v) Possible use as a sensor if small wavelength changes or wavefront perturbations modify the spatial distribution of light vi) Optical scalpel for laser surgery, cutting and sealing tissue, tattoo removal, cosmetic applications, internal/orthoscopic applications, repair of micro- and nano-structures by laser trimming etc.",1,"D.

Mechanical CAD data preparation continues to dominate most CAE activities, hindering use of advanced engineering simulation tools, and resulting in excessive costs across a broad range of design and manufacturing activities. Most commercial and legacy tools require gridding or meshing – semi-automated heuristic procedures that rely on human experts and manual processing. Recent R&D efforts have been focused on meshfree and meshless methods, but the adoption of these tools has been slow and limited, partly due to their difficulty interoperating with realistic CAD data, and partly because they are not mature enough to replace the legacy CAE tools researched and developed over many decades. As a result, significant resources spent on improving and perfecting CAE tools appear to be reinventing and improving the “representation and simulation wheel” (or “a better mousetrap”), without being able to harvest their full potential and power. The types of analysis and simulation tools sought for this topic includes but is not limited to mechanics, aerodynamics, thermal, electromagnetics, fracture, aero-elastic, noise, vibration, transport phenomena. In particular, the proposers are expected to develop and prototype one or more of the following (but not limited to): • Minimally modify existing analysis and simulation codes to support automated interoperability with CAD models, while reducing or eliminating the need for preprocessing (for example, by combining legacy CAE tools with immersed boundary or meshfree methods) • Demonstrate interoperability of existing analysis and simulation codes with legacy and emerging types of CAD models (e.g. polygonal meshes, point clouds, voxels, mixed dimensional models, splines, and implicit representations) • Develop automated agents and protocols for applying legacy analysis and simulation codes to CAD models from different sources • Demonstrate automatic interfacing and composition of different types of analysis and simulation codes and apply them to CAD models from different sources Proposers are encouraged to leverage both commercial and open source engineering simulation tools, collections of widely available solid and geometric tools and models, as well as cloud-based technologies.

Envisioned capabilities will enable near-real time measurement of a group’s state beyond the simple aggregation of individuals’ measures and behaviors, toward understanding the causes and consequences of internal and external factors on group performance over time.","There is critical DoD need for the assessment of diverse, real-world human performance capabilities, particularly in novel, challenging, or adversarial contexts where individuals and teams likely face multiple stressors. The concept of allostasis has been introduced to describe an organism’s response to one or more of these stressors in order to return to homeostasis, which can be thought of as a functional state of resilience and adaptability1The resulting “wear and tear” on the organism from this process, thought to accumulate over time and which can lead to a number of health and performance dysfunctions, is referred to as “allostatic load” [2-5]. Identifying allostatic load has demonstrated some value for trying to quantify and predict individual trajectories related to health, wellness, and behaviors [6-13]. Much of the research on allostatic load has been done in medical contexts, where associated measures, e.g., a composite index of indicators of cumulative strain on neurophysiological systems, are frequently associated with poor clinical and health outcomes. However, some research on performance in operational, competitive, and high stress environments has found seemingly paradoxical effects, where individual measures that would normally be associated with poor outcomes (such as low vagal tone) are actually associated with better performance [15]. In part, these findings may reflect the fact that current measures of allostatic load fail to incorporate the important influence a person’s social context has on their biology. Group cohesion, leadership, morale, and trust have long been qualitatively, if not quantitatively, recognized as key elements in performance and resilience. These factors may shape whether a team’s members are able to effectively deal with challenges or threats and are protected against distress and other negative impacts on performance and wellness [16-20]. Without accounting for these intangible but important social influences, conventional interpretation and prediction of any given individual’s neurophysiological state and future performance may lead to conclusions that can be misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate. Being able to quantitatively measure a team or group’s “Collective Allostatic Load” (CAL) at appropriate scales and frequencies may enable new capabilities for better predicting the current and future state and resilience of both a team and its individual members. This may further lead to capabilities for identifying and characterizing new design principles and assessment measures for human-machine teams, where – because humans are involved – such factors as trust, commitment, social support, and cohesion are likely to remain significant for shaping performance. The intent of this topic therefore is to solicit proposals for innovative quantitative and integrated approaches – addressing a full pipeline of data collection, aggregation, processing, analysis, updating, visualization, and recommendation/intervention - that might rigorously advance the goal of “making the important measurable, rather than making the measurable important” for better understanding and predicting both team and individual resilience and performance. Proposers are encouraged to leverage a wide range of domains and technologies such as wearable and non-obtrusive sensors, data science and mathematics, machine learning, network science, cognitive neuroscience, experimental psychology, psychometrics and computational social science, while seeking to demonstrate the advantages and new capabilities their proposed approach may provide over current state of the art. Examples might include proposals that provide credible approaches to leveraging the growing volume and variety of personal and social data to enable new measures for quantifying CAL; new methods for integrating a suite of sensors that might include passive or social sensing platforms to enable repeated CAL measures; new reproducible experimental approaches to testing diagnostic and predictive validity of CAL measures; indirect assessments of CAL for longitudinal studies of teams or groups in different environments. This topic is generally not seeking to fund approaches that are tightly tied to narrow experimental protocols or sensor systems, rely on restricted or excessively costly software and/or data sets, or are likely to demonstrate only incremental improvements over current, largely qualitative, often non-predictive approaches towards trying to measure team performance. Hardware and sensor approaches should leverage widely-available existing platforms and any proposed development efforts must focus on range of application, ease of use, and low barriers of entry for adoption of the approach by DOD, USG, commercial, and academic communities.",678,4799,1,No,No,No,,"Identify your specific approach to a research pipeline, including which CAL measures will be developed and how they will be collected, analyzed, validated and reproduced.

Current cybersecurity efforts focus on identifying faults in software using techniques that scan source code for faults. Such approaches may also apply potentially privacy-invading techniques, such as behavioral anomaly detection to identify malicious intent. These approaches result in significant false positives, as it is difficult to distinguish normal from abnormal behavior (e.g., the difference between a delay in correctly implementing a security function while a developer researches the proper implementation and an omission due to developer fatigue). Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish simple programming errors from systematic insertion of malicious code. Proposers to this topic must present novel methods for identifying and analyzing human dimensions that impact software development processes and significantly increase the identification of faulty and/or insecure code prior to software deployment. Mechanisms to consider may include, but are not limited to: multi-dimensional analysis and modeling of individual and group behavioral characteristics (e.g., patterns of development activity, form and content of communication amongst developers and other stakeholders), in conjunction with source code analysis over time. Proposed techniques should be robust to a variety of software development languages, platforms, and systems.

Recently, seL4, a general-purpose high-performance operating system microkernel, was released to the public as open-source software [1]. Unique to seL4 is its unparalleled degree of assurance, achieved through formal software verification — the use of mathematical proofs to show that a piece of software satisfies specific properties. As such, seL4's implementation is formally proven functionally correct (bug-free) against its specification, is proven to enforce strong security properties, and its operations have proven safe upper bounds on their worst-case execution times [2]. The open-source release of seL4 includes source code, proofs and specifications, in addition to tools, libraries and example programs that can be used to build trustworthy systems [3]. With seL4 open-sourced, the opportunity emerges to create an extensive community of developers of dependable (safe, secure, reliable) systems, in application areas ranging from national security to automotive, avionics, medical implants, and industrial SCADA automation. In the defense sector, this technology promises to lead to more secure military systems ranging from unmanned ground, air and underwater vehicles, to weapons systems, satellites, and command and control devices. However, seL4 alone is not sufficient. It provides a foundation for developing dependable systems, creating a secure software base upon which further secure software layers (i.e., system and application services) can be layered to form a trustworthy system. Consequently, DARPA seeks to build out the open-source ecosystem of secure software components around seL4. Some examples of ecosystem components may include supporting additional processor architectures, communication protocols, network stacks, trusted boot, and dependable configuration tools, as well as application layers, and so on. DARPA also seeks to have these ecosystem components demonstrated in the context of applications that have potential for national impact. Note that because seL4 enables factored security arguments [4], the components and applications do not necessarily have to be fully formally verified, but they do need to have trust arguments that tie into the formal guarantees that seL4 provides, so that relevant security properties can be established.",338,2365,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a plan for building open-source secure software components on top of seL4, together with a plan of how these components may be used to create dependable applications.

As autonomous systems increase in capability, one key bottleneck for real-world applications is the high computational cost of planning each action to execute. Because the state space of possible trajectories is enormous, planning even simple motions in relatively sparse environments can be a challenge. In well-controlled settings (such as a factory floor), planning for common motions can be computed offline, and the pre-planned actions can be executed repeatedly as long as the work environment does not change much. In even slightly less structured environments, motion planning typically requires a significant amount of auxiliary computational resources yet still adds significant delays to each action taken. Speeding up motion planning would expand the range of tasks that autonomous machines can perform because they would be able to adapt to changes immediately and more fluidly learn from the consequences of actions. This would pave the way to systems that interact with their environments in near real-time. A successful system will consider both the hardware and software aspects of this problem to provide real-time motion planning on Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP)-constrained platforms.

Current focal planes are typically designed to measure passive imagery, but active arrays are available that can measure depth using the time of flight of a short-pulsed laser illuminator, also known as light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Passive imaging drives an optical design that maximizes throughput within the spectral band of interest. However, active mode operation at long range requires efficient rejection of background illumination, and the use of a laser line pass band in the optical path. Camera designs are emerging that are able to image in both passive and active modes. Tunable/switchable filters are available, including liquid crystal, acousto-optic, or Fabry Perot filters. But each suffers from challenges that include switching speed, high passband transmission, out of band blocking, narrow bandwidth, or large aperture. Actively tunable notch wavelength filters are not required but would enable tuning and calibration, as well as other potential applications. For example, hyperspectral imagers tend to be bulky due to their large optical systems, which are needed to simultaneously collect both the spatial and spectral data, and a switchable filter with both broad passband mode and tunable narrow wavelength mode would be beneficial. In another area of interest to the DoD, obscurants such as dust or smoke limit the ability of sensors to provide cues needed by pilots or vehicle drivers while conducting operations. Narrow-band filtering of sensor imagery has been shown to improve visibility in the presence of obscurants. This application does not require a bandpass as narrow as for active illumination. The ability to create a system that has a tunable bandpass filter for spectral imaging, while also allowing broadband passive operation could reduce the number of detectors, the system size and complexity required for several different applications. Innovative approaches are sought which can simultaneously achieve all performance parameters below for laser line transmission. 1.

Current, field portable ultrasound transducer and imaging systems are readily available yet have a number of drawbacks that restrict their use. First, a highly trained technician is required to control the angle and positioning of the ultrasound wand and to decipher the images produced by these systems. Second, the relative size, weight, and power (SWaP) of current systems are restrictive for wide adoption. Third, current systems include only imaging capabilities and do not include the ability to deliver focused acoustic energy with the aim of modulating organ/tissue function (see references 1, 2). Developing ultrasound transducer systems that overcome these challenges is the focus of this topic. A wearable and conformable ultrasound system that could be placed on the body in a static location could eliminate the need for highly trained technician for wand positioning, and enable image processing software systems to read and provide diagnostic measures of the ultrasound images. Likewise, a conformable array of ultrasound transducers could conceivably reduce the SWaP of existing systems to enable broad adoption in home or field scenarios. Furthermore, there is growing interest in therapeutic applications of ultrasound, with new research demonstrating that acoustic energy delivered to tissues and organs can regulate their function. Wearable ultrasound systems may thus offer diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic capabilities in a single, lightweight device.

Traditionally, the diffraction limit of light has limited the miniaturization and high-density integration of photonic circuits and devices. One solution has been to exploit surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), which are bound waves at the interface between a metal and a dielectric. SPPs supporting structures include metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguides, insulator-metal-insulator (IMI) waveguides and dielectric loaded surface plasmon polaritons waveguides have been suggested and demonstrated [1]. Because the energy mostly propagates in the low loss dielectric layer, the latter have much longer propagation lengths than MIM waveguides. However, to broaden nanoscale photonic functionality, MIM structures can confine light to deep subwavelength scales (e.g. < 0.05 of a wavelength) enhancing non-linear effects. In addition, recent developments in subwavelength antennas and meta-atoms, suggests that the dynamics and coupling between two or more subwavelength shaped structures can provide further functionality. The propagation length of MIM structures varies from several micrometers to several tens of micrometers, which is adequate for many for nano-photonic applications. Passive photonic circuits elements such directional couplers (DC) and Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) based on MIM structures have been proposed and demonstrated. These devices can provide components for signal processing, but an all-optical circuit requires active devices. SPP’s in reduced sized structures containing non-linear optical materials can provide modulating capabilities [2]. Control over the plasmon characteristics relies on the design of the nanostructures’ composition and morphology. Prior research includes optical bistability and variable transmission responses under different incident intensities [3], demonstrating all-optical approaches to control light with light. The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation used in photonic components, devices and circuits, and hence photonic device size, is approximately one hundred times larger than typical electronic components. The use of high index dielectrics will only shrink the optical wavelength in proportion to the refractive index of refraction. Plasmonics, i.e. a collective oscillation of electrons at the surface of a conducting material, oscillate at optical frequencies and propagate along and are tightly confined to the surface with dimensions comparable to electronic circuits. Transverse decay lengths are on the order of the skin depth, 10 nm. Plasmonic structures and devices are lossy but only need to carry information a few centimeters across a chip or a few microns within a device to be effective in fusing electronics with photonics. Light at optical frequencies can be focused to a spot size of only 5 nm through the use of surface plasmons. This tight confinement of electromagnetic waves provides device opportunities and high intensities facilitate non-linear effects that may have low switching threshold energies and fast response times. Non-linear effects can be exploited for frequency conversion, parametric effects as well as simple harmonic generation. These properties are governed by the subwavelength features in plasmonic components and devices, and provide a means to control light with light [4].",479,3442,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate the feasibility of non-linear, plasmonic-based devices which provide some specific functionality like frequency conversion at high data rates. Ideally they should have low loss, support small (e.g. less than 1 µm2) footprints and be compatible with CMOS electronic devices at the chip level for control and tunability. Suggested devices include, but are not limited to, all-optical switch, modulators, optical limiter, frequency up-conversion, frequency down-conversion, self focusing, self phase modulation, and Raman scattering. To support scalability requirements of next generation signal processing architectures, the modulators should occupy a small footprint (target is ≤ 2 µm2) have low insertion loss characteristics (<5dB), while providing efficient performance.

Applications are increasingly data-rich, yet the security protections available for the most popular platforms do not provide any data controls within the context of a single application. While some applications do employ proprietary ad hoc sandboxing, such technology only enforces separation of the application from the operating system, instead of separation of the data used within the application. This topic seeks ways to add data controls with generic operating system or application-embedded security extensions. The root cause of a large class of application attacks stems from memory corruption vulnerabilities. These memory errors may, for example, be caused by an application using uninitialized memory, pointers to objects that have been previously freed, or accessing a buffer of data beyond the allocated size of the data. Traditionally, these vulnerabilities have been used in attacks that seize control of an application by altering control-flow, for example, by injecting new code into the application or by leveraging existing code. Contemporary defenses seek to reduce the number of memory corruption vulnerabilities, and the widespread deployment of practical implementations of data-execution prevention (DEP) and control-flow integrity (CFI) [1] have made code injection and code reuse attacks more difficult to pull off than they once were. Nevertheless, applications are routinely shown to be vulnerable to the loss of data security [2], both in terms of confidentiality and integrity, especially in light of non-control data attacks [3,7,8]. Hence, the DoD seeks a framework for application data sandboxing (or isolation, partitioning, etc.) of data-rich applications that provide data security, both in terms of confidentiality and integrity [4], thereby preventing or significantly limiting both the modification and disclosure of security-relevant data used by an application. The data security model should go beyond Bell-LaPadula and Biba Integrity models, which only separate higher-privileged data from lower-privileged data. This requirement stems from the fact that data-oriented attacks typically involve accessing data of the same privilege-level (e.g., passwords, keys, browser cookies), but across different contexts (e.g., domains, users, processes) [5,6]. The framework should be transparent to the user, not interfere with normal application functionality, not require extensive manual software re-architecting, and should operate with minimal negative performance impact under normal usage of the application. The approaches taken should, for example, identify security-relevant data, partition the data into appropriately sized groupings of data and the code that may access those data groupings, then enforce the partitioning at runtime. Frameworks that correctly and efficiently operate on COTS binaries are favored.",430,3050,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct a feasibility study to determine innovative cyber techniques and mechanisms that can be used within a methodology for application data sandboxing of data-rich applications. Design the resulting concept framework capable of sandboxing data in COTS applications. The framework should prevent or significantly limit the modification and disclosure of security-relevant data used by an application (e.g., cryptographic keys, passwords, personal and banking information, configuration settings) in the presence of a memory disclosure (or modification) attack. The framework should operate with negligible performance overhead. An initial prototype may make use of program source code and have a negative impact on program performance, so long as a clear path is provided to eliminate those issues in Phase II. As part of Phase I, a test case with success criteria for data security in data-rich applications should be defined. Phase I deliverables will include a final report that details initial prototype design and concept framework, and any preliminary results for the test case. For this topic, DARPA will accept proposals for work and cost up to $150,000 for Phase I. The preferred structure is a $100,000, 6-month base period, and a $50,000, 4-month option period.",Fully develop the Phase I concept framework. The resulting prototype will be demonstrated in accordance with the success criteria developed in Phase I. Phase II deliverables will include a working prototype and final report that details demonstration results.,"This dual-use technology applies to both military and commercial environments affected by cyber adversaries. Commercial benefits include increased cyber warfare protection of infiltration of a company’s data, preventing or significantly limiting both the modification and disclosure of security-relevant data used by an application, and thus, increased protection of critical infrastructure environments (e.g., health, electrical, transportation, etc.). The DoD and the commercial world have similar challenges with respect to maintaining the integrity of their cyber computing and communications infrastructure. The DoD is concerned with being able to effectively keep the cyber intruder from penetrating operational systems that support the warfighter. The resulting framework, capable of sandboxing data in COTS applications and adding data controls with generic operating system or application-embedded security extensions, is directly transitionable to the DoD for use by the services (e.g., Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSC), Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)).",1,"Blog.ropchain.com.

Conversely, the DoD has historically required domestic, low-volume, and trusted fabrication sources in order to safeguard classified IP contained in circuit designs. As commercial market practices continue to diverge from DoD policy, new technologies are required to ensure that the military retains access to the most advanced fabrication nodes for its high-performance hardware needs [1]. The past decade has seen intense academic interest in hardware security techniques [2, 3] intended to prevent the reverse engineering and subsequent modification of sensitive IP by unauthorized third parties. Application specific ICs (ASICs) fabricated in foreign, untrusted foundries are particularly vulnerable to these threats since the full design is easily available through imaging and side-channel analysis. Once an adversary extracts the design, they may resynthesize the netlist and layout to include malicious modifications, sometimes referred to as hardware Trojan horses (HTHs). HTHs may modify the circuit’s functionality, leak sensitive information, or degrade performance. Obfuscation of ASIC functionality [4, 5] is sometimes employed to protect a design from reverse engineering, thereby increasing the difficulty of inserting an effective HTH. However, such measures do not provide complete security. Indeed, the additional circuitry needed to obfuscate a design incurs penalties to performance, power, and chip area, ultimately limiting the practically attainable degree of security. In the event that trusted practices and obfuscation do not provide sufficient security over an ASIC development flow, other security measures that expose signatures of logic modifications post-manufacture are the last line of defense against HTHs. Such authentication tests can be performed either during integration acceptance testing at a trusted packaging facility or during operation in real time. In the former, test vectors are applied to the IC in order to either trigger a HTH response or observe HTH side effects on the power and/or timing characteristics of ICs [6]. Unfortunately, well-designed HTHs are stealthy, rarely triggered, and have signatures that are difficult to distinguish from similar effects caused by manufacturing variability. DARPA seeks to promote the practice of HTH testing by advancing design-for-test (DFT) principles into industry standard EDA tools. These measures should sensitize IC designs to HTH insertions or provide additional functionality to improve the probability of detection, and should be of integrated within commercial EDA development flows such that performance and overhead impacts will be less severe than ad-hoc approaches. Other authentication measures can monitor the information flow on an ASIC during operation [7,8]. DARPA seeks to develop new methods that detect faulty logic with high probability, prevent the triggering of HTHs, or reconfigure logic in real time to mitigate the impacts of HTHs that happen to pass through acceptance testing or other defensive measures.",458,3202,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a methodology for an innovative design for test, runtime monitoring, HTH trigger defense, or other hardware security technique that mitigates the risk of HTH insertion.

A new advanced monolithic aircraft typically requires 10-25 years to design, develop, and build. New technology concepts are subject to requirements and other processes which can render them programmatically unrealizable before the technology becomes obsolete. An innovative approach is needed to ‘build on demand’ and to incrementally enhance existing capability. There are two main pieces to this effort: the ability to rapidly build a FMR on demand at a rate of 500 units per month and the FMR itself designed to be produced at a rate of 500 units per month. An FMR is a device that can optionally remain on the wing of a host F-16 or F-18 aircraft and release an AIM-120 missile, or alternately, fly away from the host aircraft acting as a booster and extending the range of an AIM-120, Small Diameter Bomb, or special payload pod. Once the FMR reaches the target area, the FMR vehicle would be capable of loitering until the weapon is released. The flight performance and flying characteristics of the FMR will be a fallout of the successful performer’s design, and is constrained by the wing hardpoint capacity (to be estimated by the proposer based on public data). Design parameters of the FMR may include configuration, payload capacity (1 or 2 AIM-120s, other payloads), aerodynamic design, engine selection, flight performance, minimal payload slot for a radio with a power connector, the radio itself, and an antenna for the radio. The design and analysis of FMR technology can leverage an appropriate a suite of engineering analysis and modeling and simulation tools in the execution of this task. Additionally, this vision calls for an ability to rapidly manufacture the design in the future. An objective vision would foresee the ability to surge and construct up to 500 FMRs (goal) in a 1 month period. Technical and procedural approaches to this surge manufacturing capacity are desired. It is anticipated that this manufacturing objective may drive aspects of the FMR design itself. It is anticipated that this broad topic would benefit from small business innovation both in aircraft design and manufacturing technology. Successful proposals will address both aspects, and suggest a path to future risk reduction (Phase II and beyond), that may include prototype manufacturing, testing, or other activity. Rapid manufacturing and aircraft design are two specialties which often do not reside in the same company. Teaming is highly encouraged for all proposals in all phases to bring the best experts into one design. Phase II may award FMR and rapid manufacturing as two separate Phase II efforts to increase overall program effectiveness though two separate efforts would be considered the same team. The proposers are expected to choose all elements and components of the design which enable rapid manufacturing and that no equipment will be specified by the government. The FMR must be built for rapid manufacture and be compatible with the F-16 and F-18. Communication equipment (Link-16, weapons data link, etc) can be suggested or provisioned for under the auspices of rapid manufacture of the FMR. Any available low SWAP-C military data links may be considered, assuming that low SWAP-C radios enables rapid manufacture. Any necessary flight computers, bus wiring, mechanical equipment, engines, software, and required electronics are the responsibility of the proposers. Detailed designs and models using actual hardware and software are highly desired over intentions to integrate existing capability. Capability creep must not impact the sole mission of the FMR: The mission of the FMR is to be a reusable if not launched from the host platform or fly to a point, loiter, and launch its payload. Alternate uses for the FMR will be asked WITHOUT a desire to change the design. The FMR does not need to maintain controlled flight after it’s last munition is expended (if designed for multiple munitions) but will have an operational utility if it controlled flight can be maintained. Again, rapid manufacture of the FMR is a priority and any capability beyond flight after launch is a bonus if the rate of 500 per month is not impacted. The AIM-120 is the primary munition to be considered. Any additional munition capability is an added bonus but the AIM-120 is the point of the FMR.",722,4455,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a conceptual design for a flying missile rail and estimate performance. Develop low-risk approaches that are suited for massive surge manufacturing, e.g. capable of rapidly manufacturing up to 500 flying missile rails (goal) in one month. The rail should be capable of acting as a conventional AIM-120 missile rail on F-16 and F-18 aircraft, or optionally acting as an independent robotic range booster for the AIM-120. Phase I deliverables will include: 1. Conceptual flying missile rail design • The flying missile rail must be compatible with existing F-16 and F-18 loaders. Proposers should source public information to estimate F-16 or F-18 hardpoint capacity. Additional information may be provided during a Phase I. 2. Prediction of flight capability and characteristics, suitable for evaluation by a third party. • Flight time and flight characteristics of the flying FMR with AIM-120 loadout. • Altitude and airspeed profile of the FMR post AIM-120 launch to end-of-flight. • Any of the above characteristics by carrying other munitions after the AIM-120 loadout is fully analyzed. 3. Conceptual design of a flying missile rail production approach that produces up to 500 flying missile rails (goal) in one month. • There is no requirement to manufacture the flying missile rail in austere locations. The objective is on-demand rate and location is part of the analysis. • Analysis should include transportation of a manufactured device from the manufactured location to and on a C-17 compatible pallet. • Clearly identified assumptions on rates or pre-requisites 4. The Phase II proposal will be due 3 months after Phase I award to promote rapid progress to a Phase II award. For this topic, DARPA will accept proposals for work and cost up to $225,000 for Phase I. The preferred structure is a $175,000, 6-month base period, and a $50,000, 4-month option period. Alternative structures may be accepted if sufficient rationale is provided.","Perform risk reduction on the flying missile rail design and manufacturing approach developed in Phase I. Risk reduction may include: • Prototype manufacture • Prototype testing • Manufacturing approach development or demonstration. The exact content of the Phase II risk reduction approach shall be up to the proposer. It is expected that the choice will be made weighing the greatest technical risks the concept of a flying missile rail and associated manufacturing approach. High impact demonstrations are highly desirable. Approaches and risk reduction activity which lend themselves to follow-on activity (fit testing, captive carry, test flights, manufacturing pilots) are desirable. For a performer choosing to prioritize flying missile rail design risk reduction, notional Phase II deliverables might include any of the following: 1. One or more safe separation mass models representative of the final design. 2. Detailed design of the manufacturing approach including cost assumptions required for long term storage. 3. Detailed design of a flying missile rail. 4. Physical installation of a flying missile rail. Ideally this is suited for captive carry on F-16 or F-18, but DARPA recognizes this level of maturity may not be realizable within scope of Phase II. 5. Detailed predictions of flight characteristics and performance. 6. Risk reduction demonstration of rapid manufacturing approach. 7. Safe separation analysis for the release of: • The flying missile rail with AIM-120 from an F-16 (stations 3 and 7 with 300 gallon fuel tanks on station 4 and 6) and F-18. • An AIM-120 from a flying missile rail where the flying missile rail stays attached to the F-16 and F-18. • An AIM-120 from a flying missile rail (the flying missile rail is flying and the AIM-120 is successfully launched from the flying missile rail). A performer choosing to prioritize manufacturing approach risk reduction could identify alternative deliverables in their Phase II proposal. Teaming is highly encouraged for all proposals in all phases to bring the best experts into one design. Phase II may award FMR and rapid manufacturing as two separate Phase II efforts to increase overall program effectiveness though two separate efforts would be considered the same team.","The commercial application resulting from this effort will demonstrate to other qualified contractors how to develop rapid and short lifetime systems to the DoD without the traditional long-term programmatic timeline. Learning how to break into the Defense Sector is an extremely powerful and valuable commodity to the commercial sector. The Military application resulting from this effort will be twofold: an actual on-call mass-manufactured weapon system and a process that can be applied to other systems. This example system, the Flying Missile Rail, is a system which will be utilized immediately but is too low on the DoD priority to procure. The traditional DoD timelines, operation and maintenance, and life-limit on short term point solutions prevent their procurement. The benefit of an SBIR-enabled “build-on-demand” system demonstrates how to maneuver within the Federal Acquisition Regulations using a different model to achieve rapid capability. This change will address one of DARPA’s challenges. This program is an application of an existing DoD program such as the Air Force Research Lab’s Loyal Wingman Program (see references).",1,http://www.darpa.mil/program/gremlins; https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=fa87323841777b53ba42c2fcc51b5458&tab=core&_cview=0; https://researchfunding.duke.edu/rfi-autonomy-loyal-wingman-testbed; https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/pentagon-touts-loyal-wingman-for-combat-jets-423682/; http://www.c4isrnet.com/articles/loyal-wingman-program-seeks-to-realize-benefits-of-advancements-in-autonomy,http://www.darpa.mil/program/gremlins; https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=fa87323841777b53ba42c2fcc51b5458&tab=core&_cview=0; https://researchfunding.duke.edu/rfi-autonomy-loyal-wingman-testbed; https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/pentagon-touts-loyal-wingman-for-combat-jets-423682/; http://www.c4isrnet.com/articles/loyal-wingman-program-seeks-to-realize-benefits-of-advancements-in-autonomy,5,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/81188/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/81188/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,17.3 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:19:00,,,,,SB173-005_81188,DOD_SBIR_17_P1_C3_SB173-005,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:01.57866+00

Many established aerospace and emerging entrepreneurial companies are developing new ELV/stage technologies that strive to dramatically reduce the cost of access to space. The goal of this topic is to leverage these investments to enable operability-driven, low-cost launch vehicles capable of deploying payloads of militarily relevant mass and volume to orbit. Technological trends facilitating such ELVs include an ongoing computer/software revolution enabling affordable design; sophisticated software in lieu of mechanical complexity, integration, and test; micro-miniaturization of electronics and mechanical actuators; high strength-to-weight composites and nano-engineered materials; lightweight structural concepts and thermal protection; advanced manufacturing methods that enable high- thrust/weight rocket engines and turbo-machinery; and liquid propellants that are safe, affordable, and promote ease of handling. The proposer must demonstrate a clear understanding of the system applications of the launch vehicle, and a high level of technical and engineering maturity with respect to all critical technologies for this expendable vehicle or upper stage. Key design elements include non-toxic propellants, functional mechanisms and accommodations for insertion of operational satellites, and balancing gross mass with adequate velocity change, payload, and manufacturing cost. Low-cost stages with efficient structural arrangements to accommodate the structural interface and load paths to the reusable booster, while maintaining sufficient functionality and performance, are of interest. ELV designs that can be re-purposed for tactical missile applications and future boost glide air-transport systems are also of interest. A clear understanding of the technology applications to any proposed military or commercial system is essential. Critical technologies may include lightweight structures and propulsion, low-cost additively manufactured engines and components, high-impulse-density propellants, miniaturized avionics, modular components, altitude compensation and complementary aerodynamic/propulsion integration, and stability, guidance and control subsystems—all integrated into the stage while keeping the system simple and affordable.

In peacetime, the primary source of such hypervelocity projectiles is man made orbital debris. In wartime, hostile offensive action may result in the addition to this debris environment of projectiles such as the pellets and fragments from the breakup of other satellites. TO protect these space systems, effective debris impact shields must be designed and implemented. Since the impact velocities exceed considerably the capabilities of current ground launcher technology, the design and analysis of such shields must rely heavily on the extension of laboratory impact data from moderate to high impact velocities by computer simulations of impact events. In an effort to optimize shield performance, DARPA is exploring the use of certain classes of materials which offer the potential for major improvements in shield capability. Of particular interest are ceramics. Examples include lightweight ceramic armor and ceramics with microstructure. Accordingly, it is the intent of this research topic to identify and demonstrate the advantageous use of ceramics in advanced shield designs.

This, in turn, opens the possibility of autonomously powered repeaters in a fiber optic telemetry cable system. Thus, the weight and expense of supplying power for repeaters and sensors through the trunk cable can be eliminated, and this can save an order of magnitude in the size of the trunk line cable. Unfortunately, present batteries available for the powering of repeaters are relatively expensive, and its predicted that within a repeater module, the battery would be the most expensive component. Present technology suggests the use of a lithium thionyl chloride batter which would cost between $5,000 and $10,00. The purpose of the proposed research effort is to investigate novel methods of supplying approximately 1 watt of electrical power for 1 year on the ocean seabed. The power source must be easily transportable, deployable under military conditions, and have minimal volume. In addition, it must be safe to handle, and obviously must not depend upon light as an energy source. Three approaches are known at this time: Seawater batteries, radioisotope thermo-electric generators (TRG’s), and optical powering. (a) Sea Water Batteries. The government is undertaking some research in this area, using the cathodic corrosion of, say, magnesium or aluminum in sea water to produce low voltage (about 1 volt) at low current levels. This research is directed at a specific application, and further basic research is warranted in the selection of materials, the build-up of hydrogen on the cathode and its elimination with low water flow over the active surface, low power dc-to-dc converters to boost cell voltages of 1 volt to 5 to 25 volts, and the shape and material of the cathode. (b) Radioisotope Thermo-electric Generators (RTG’s). RTG’s have been available to supply power in remote areas for sometime. In use on the seabed for fiber optic repeaters, a number of difficulties arise concerning the safety of the nuclear material. Present designs for RTG’s primarily use in uranium or plutonium as the fuel, which has difficulties because of the toxicity of the material and its by-products and international controls on accountable weapons grade material. The research should focus on the possibility of other less toxic isotopes, which could still supply the now-reduced power requirements, and be less politically sensitive. (c) Optical Powering. If attenuation in optical fibers continues to drop, and the efficiency with which light can be converted into electrical energy increases, it may be possible to supply some or all of the power to such a repeater through a ser of optical fibers.

Among the systems which have been deployed with varying degrees of success are the so-called ""Underwater telephone,” the Integrated Acoustic Communication System (IACS), and several approaches using explosive sound sources. Simultaneously, the oil industry has developed many variants of underwater control and telemetry systems, generally based on coded acoustic tone, intended for use with both underwater vehicles and wellhead equipment at ranges on the order of a kilometer. For many recent applications of interest, communication ranges on the order of 200 km, with data rates of 10 bits/second would be operationally useful, but no known existing approach can supply this performance at acceptable error tares (less than 103 per bit). To some extent, data rate and range can be traded off against each other, but it is also strongly desirable that candidate systems and approaches should be maximally covert and minimally susceptible to enemy jamming. Two-way communication is required in many applications, and power demands should thus be commensurate with limitations imposed by small, remote, unnamed platforms. New approaches are sought to solve the communications problem posed above. It is anticipated that investigation of candidate systems would be divided into two phases: (1) Conceptual waveform and channel design, with theoretical and analytical assessment based on existing environmental and experimental data describing propagation characteristics. (2) Based on successful theoretical results, fabrication of prototype equipment and experimental verification of competing approaches by means of critical demonstrations at sea. (b) Multiple Access and Control in Hostile Areas. Novel techniques for control of, and report back from, distributed sensors operating in denied or hostile geographical areas are needed. The sensors cannot be expected to retain long-term synchronization without external control. Hencs communication to and from the sensors must be controlled external to the overall system.

The strength member would typically consist of a Kevlar/epoxy matrix or S-glass compound. The cable is usually less than one tenth of an inch in diameter, may be from 8 km to 50 km in length and is precision wound on a cylindrical or truncated conical mandrel. Two methods of deployment are in use: the outside wind, instead of a building a cable pack by laying successively larger cylinders of cable on top of the other (like thread on a spool), the layers are built up as flat discs which are stacked on after the other (not unlike a stack of phonograph records, or, yes, pancakes). The winding sequence would being by winding the first layer on a spiral pattern, inside an upright cylindrical tank, say inside to out. When this layer was finished the next layer would be wound, outside to in, and so forth, in alternating flat disc layers. When deployed, the cable would be peeled off the flat face of the cylinder. This payout method would appear to have less chance of hockling, more even peel-point stress, and greater flexibility in combining cable packs.

Interests include such areas as source and detector integration onto a VLSI chip, the optical control of integrated electronic devices, optical switching elements, reconfigurable optical channels, and all optical generalized cross bar switching networks. Guided channels may be considered for intrachip interconnects, but the advantages of unguided optical channels should play a major role in solving interchip and interprocessor communications. Once the electronic signals have been converted to optical signals, optical imaging and holography may be used to guide the optical beam to its destination, which would likely be a photo-detector to another chip. One may go so far as to envision reprogrammable interconnects employing the optical phenomena of four-wave mixing. The bottom line in realizing opto-electronic interconnects is a need for research into nonlinear optics because it is the nonlinear aspect of optics that lies at the root of many of the desired operations – from integrated light sources, through optical switched and reconfigurable channels, to four wave mixing.

One way of enhancing system reliability is to allow the use of alternate optical paths in the even of electronics failure. Redundant optical paths are now implemented by using optical couplers, which permanently split the optical paths and energy. An alternate method would be through the use of an optical switch or commutator, in which the optical path is physically changed by a mechanical means. Mechanical switches are made more difficult by the shift of the fiber optic telemetry implementation to single mode optics with light core diameters of 5 microns. The resulting tolerances for a match between optical waveguides are one micron or less.

We desire a low cost (%5k to $50k each in quantities of 100) multi-purpose mobile robot suitable for educational and laboratory use. Just as the proliferation of computer-based work stations has accelerated progress in computer science, so should the ready availability of a suitable mobile robot accelerate the progress in intelligent systems research. This study should trade off possible capabilities of the robot vs. cost and produce an effective design. Modularity and interfaces are important considerations. Almost all users are expected to need an imaging visual sensor (e.g. TV camera). Many users will require some form of manipulator(s). Other sensors and effectors should be considered. Careful attention should be paid to the mode of mobility. Wheels or tank-tracks are possibilities, an air bearing would require a specially prepared environment and would therefore probably be too limiting, and legged locomotion is quite general, but may be too expensive. Some on-board local processing will no doubt be required, but users are expected to have substantial processing resources in their laboratories, on which their algorithms already run. Therefore a capable bi-directional tele-communications link will be required.",269,1810,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70398/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/70398/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,86.6 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:19:23,,,,,SB86-014_70398,DOD_SBIR_86_P1_C6_SB86-014,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:02.119317+00

This powerful new technique relies on electrostatic focusing of the high energy electron beam by the positive space charge of the ion column which remains after the beam electrons have expelled the background plasma electrons. High current beam instabilities, which had previously limited electron beam currents to less than 5 kiloamps, are totally suppressed by this new technique.

Advances in electron microscopy have revealed that optical thin films produced by evaporation are strongly columnar in nature with voids between the columns.

Exceptions include work by Lehner and Wilkins’. The classical framework for thinking about adversaries is game trees, in which my moves and my opponent’s alternate. One could import this idea into planning by generating a few plans, making a copy of the temporal database for each one, then generating the opponent’s counterparts as similar temporal database copies, and so forth. Unfortunately, the resulting tree would be artificial. There is no natural ""move” structure to impose on real-life planning, so the time after which the enemy will react is somewhat arbitrary. Furthermore, much of what agents do is hidden from adversaries, so their reactions will be uninteresting. And, of course, it is not obvious how to find quintescent positions where a ""broad evaluation function” can be applied. Still, we must find some way of thinking about how the enemy reacts to what we do. We begin by having some notion of what the enemy’s plan is. To infer it, we must use plan recognition techniques. Some aspects of the enemy’s plan may suggest goals (e.g., ""stop this advance”) to be incorporated into our plan. Other aspects (e.g., our belief that the enemy plans to shoot anything that enters a certain field of fire) get added to the ""world physics.” Our plan, including our countergoals, is now formulated. It is then projected as usual, and potential problems are noted. At this phase, the enemy’s actions appear as problems in the same sense that nature presents problems. An enemy field of fire is dangerous in much the same way that a forest fire is dangerous. Planning must come to a halt when it is detected that our actions will not have the desired effect, and enemy action is one way that can happen. Crudely put, the protected fact ""Our troops are alive and well” can be violated. We can now apply standard planning techniques to the problem. If an enemy machine-gun installation is causing the problem, we can add steps to the plan to get rid of it. In addition, there is a special class of techniques for the enemy-action situation, revolving around the idea of deception. A full-scale solution to the problem of what other agents believe would be quite complex, but that’s probably unnecessary. In most cases, all we want to do is alter our plans so that the enemy cannot tell what we are doing. All behavior is, so it is a useful tack to try to conceal it. A step up on complexity arises when we allow misleading actions, such as diversionary attacks. There may be standard methods of creating useful diversions, or it may be that this problem is too hard to tackle now. To sum it up, the planner is looking for a ""fixed point,” in mathematical jargon, a stable set of beliefs about its own intentions and the enemy’s, such that what it believes the enemy will do makes sense given the enemy’s likely knowledge of the planner’s intended actions; and the planner’s intended actions make sense given the enemy’s plan. There are many planning problems involving the enemy where such fixed points can be found without too much trouble. In particular, if the forces controlled by the planner are quite small compared to enemy forces, then it is unlikely that the planner’s activities can affect what the enemy does, e.g., a single autonomous vehicle operating near enemy lines. It will probably treat enemy activity as a violent form of weather; get too near a storm and you are destroyed. The vehicle’s actions do not themselves cause enemy activity, but are only affected by it. Of course, there are cases where the presence of the robot will give away the proximity of the entire friendly army, and change the enemy’s plans drastically, but in those cases we should just treat ""Avoid detection by the enemy” as a top-priority constraint on all plans, and not attempt to think about what happens if the constraint is violated. Note that another form of planning closely related to the adversarial situation is worst-case planning. Here we want to think about how well we can cope with various possible disasters. Even if there is no opponent, we can treat Nature as an opponent by assuming that just by chance she acts as if she were out to get us. This kind of planning is harder than normal adversarial planning because there is no notion of the ""opponent’s” plan; in principle we have to think about virtually everything that could happen in order to anticipate all disasters. Reasoning about deception is of no use in worst-case planning, because the opponent is assumed to be clairvoyant, and to always do what will damage us the most. It is difficult to see how to automate this kind of planning using current approaches. It is quite possible that in most circumstances there is no systematic way to think about the worst case; you make a few guesses about what might happen, but if the worst case actually comes to pass it will probably involve events you didn’t anticipate.",859,5000,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/55246/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/55246/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,88.8 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:19:48,,,,,SB88-027_55246,DOD_SBIR_88_P1_C8_SB88-027,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:02.716199+00

As an automated planner makes decisions, it must record them in some temporal database. Information about the actions of allies, adversaries, and nature must also be stored there. The temporal database must be an active memory, which notices ""interesting” conjunctions of facts and draws ""interesting” inferences. A classical database stores facts. A temporal databse stores occasions on which facts are true. A classical database draws inferences from conjunctions of facts. A temporal database must draw inferences from the overlap of occasions. This kind of inference is a type of forward chaining, drawing conclusions as soon as their premises are known. Some preliminary work on projection, defined as forward chaining through time, has been done. The work of deKleer and Brown, Forbus, and Kuipers on qualitative physics concerns itself with predicting the operation of devices with weak knowledge of their parameters. Dean has included some simple forward chaining machinery in his temporal database. However, much remains to be done. For one thing, qualitative-physics research is ""too qualitative.” In this paradigm, the reaction to the uncertainty caused by incomplete knowledge is to generate several different scenarios, each consistent with what is known. In some cases, a better reaction would be to use more quantitative knowledge and avoid the uncertainty. Projection must also deal with the problem of loops. If a device oscillates, we want to notice that rather than blindly simulate it. The usual approach is to characterize the system at a course enough level that loops are easy to detect. In realistic planning, oscillations are lest likely, but loop detection is harder. Another problem that arises is that as the projection goes further into the future, there are likely to be bigger and bigger uncertainties about overlaps. We need to be able to halt the projection and resume it as further constraints make the overlap definitely present or absent. It is probably infeasible to monitor possible overlaps in arbitrary cases. The purpose of all this machinery is for detecting bugs in plans. As the projector paints its picture, ""demons” must note the existence of problems. Such demons amount to a generalized form of protection. Adding risk and uncertainty to the picture may complicate it surprisingly little. Handling them requires solving three problems: 1) Assigning probabilities to future events, or in some other way weighing risks, 2) Generating alternative scenarios given different alternative futures of varying probability, and 3) Patching plans to cope with possible events. The first problem has remained naggingly difficulty for some time. There is much discussion in AI about the need for new models of reasoning about uncertainty, but the only really well worked-out model is Bayesian inference. Fortunately, ad hoc schemes for assigning numbers to possibilities have worked pretty well. The second problem is mostly a matter of temporal database technology. We need to be able to copy the current database and make changes to the copy corresponding to a scenario of some degree of likelihood. There needs to be several copies in existence at one time. The programming technology for managing multiple copies of this kind already exists (e.g., Dean’s thesis). The only danger is that too many copies will be attempted, clogging the system. The third problem, patching the plan, has not been addressed at all, but that’s mainly because it has been neglected in the non-probabilistic case as well. Risk and uncertainty behave the same up to a point, but they diverge when the possibility of learning new information exists. For a risky situation, there is no way by definition to drive probabilities to 1 by learning more. In an uncertain one, there well may be. It is not hard to find ways of distinguishing between risk and ignorance – there is a consensus to use probability ranges instead of point estimates – but it is somewhat harder to plan to narrow the range. Many of these issues are dealt with in classical decision theory. Our collection of temporal databases may be considered equivalent to a decision tree, but there is more to it than that. The classical theory assumes that estimates of utility were to be obtained from a human decision maker. We need to reinvent utility theory for a truly autonomous agent, who must be able to compare a given risk of loss of itself against another risk of losing some other resources that it might be able to save. Such comparisons are nontrivial. Coming up with theories of utility for robots is likely to be an uncomfortable job, as well as technically tricky.",759,4704,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66913/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66913/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,88.8 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,DARPA,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:19:50,,,,,SB88-030_66913,DOD_SBIR_88_P1_C8_SB88-030,,1,2025-08-09 19:52:02.716199+00

Approximately twenty-five percent of all vehicles destroyed in World War II were due to mines; in Viet Nam the figure was nearly seventy percent. Current detection methods involve either manual probing or use of metal detectors. Both methods are manpower intensive and slow, and both leave human operators exposed to covering fire. Current neutralization techniques include plows, rollers, or flails attached to the front of a vehicle, and projected explosive charges. These methods are slow and vulnerable to covering projected explosive charges. These methods are slow and vulnerable to covering fire, and are rarely used until the presence of a minefield is established. A minefield protected with covering fire can be extremely difficult to breach, similarly, the use of infrequent individual mines is very difficult to counter. The problem of detection and/or neutralization is complicated by a wide variety of mines (buried/surface-laid and metallic/non-metallic), fuzing techniques (e.g., pressure, magnetic, trip-line), and environmental conditions. It is most desirable that detection systems should be capable of operating in real time, at normal vehicular advance rates, with high detection/false target ratios, and with sufficient standoff to allow the carrying vehicle to avoid engaging a detected mine.

These technologies include sensors for day/night and all-weather conditions and Automatic Target Recognizers. Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) is a key element in a variety of autonomous weapon systems including smart munitions, target cuers for aircraft, and fire and forget missiles. More recently, ATR has emerged as an important element in advanced systems such as the Smart Weapons Program (SWP) and the Electromagnetic Gun Weapons System (EMGWS), both of which seek to apply advanced multiple sensor, ATR and Strategic Computer Technologies. In each of these systems the outputs of the sensors are directed to a high speed image processor for extraction of targets from the scene and classification. Without ATR algorithms which can function under a variety of input scene conditions, the utility of these systems is at risk. Even though considerable funds have been expended by DOD to solve this problem over the past ten years, robust and reliable ATR algorithms are still not available. Attempts have been made to combine conventional bottom-up processing with a top-down, rule-based artificial intelligence system in order to take advantage of a priori and contextual information. However, imposing top-down information at processing levels below the feature space conversion has limited its effectiveness. As a result, the top-down information is only used for consistency checks of the bottom-up conclusions.

The wet chemical process is difficult to control and is not amenable to the automation necessary for high throughput, high yield semiconductor manufacturing. Dry etching of compound semiconductors, either by laser ablation or in a plasma reactor is feasible, but has not been demonstrated as a production technique for MCT detectors. Diode performance has been shown with the dry etching process, but the characteristics are not equivalent to state of the art diodes produced with the wet chemical process. Development of a production compatible dry etch process for MCT photo detectors requires design and demonstration of a reactor with geometry suitable for uniform, high throughput etching, optimization of the etch parameters, development of photo masking approaches and automation technology. Realization of this technique will substantially increase the control essential for process repeatability, and demonstrate a crucial sub module for a mercury cadmium telluride detector micro factory, where processing is accomplished in a completely controlled environment.

The characteristics of the material as it is grown are not monitored, and the material characterization is usually accomplished subsequent to growth by a series of evaluations which sample small sections of the wafer. Since several growth runs are completed before a thorough characterization is available, growth parameters cannot be adjusted in real time to optimize the growth. An in-situ sensor to control material properties is needed to optimize the growth process for a production environment. This is also necessary to eliminate the successive growth of low quality material before a complete evaluation is obtained. This control philosophy not only achieves real time adjustment of growth parameters, but also eliminates the need for costly post-growth material evaluations. Several optical techniques are available to nondestructively map wafer properties, but these have not been integrated into the growth apparatus and investigated as growth control mechanisms. Significant cost reduction benefits can be realized from a reproducible, high quality material input to the infrared focal plane array manufacturing line before substantial value is added to the product.

However, this assumption is critical in view of recent possibilities to obtain information on the detailed geology of the emplacement sites of Soviet nuclear explosions which often are detonated in such rocks. The theoretical analysis of coupling in these rocks is difficult and there is a substantial lack of experimental data. It is through that laboratory and field experiments with conventional explosives can provide a great deal of insight into this problem. Problems of importance to consider in experimental design include the roles of saturation, hydrostatic pressure, distance to the free surface, scaling of cracks with respect to explosion yield, yield scaling in general, and the effect of gravity on the development of spall. An important objective is that a body of reliable, reproducible data be developed which future workers in the field can use.

One explanation for this phenomenon is that the explosions, being near surface, are detonated in a medium with a lower Q. A second explanation is that the Lg phase from explosions is generated from P to S conversions at the free surface. Theory suggests that this conversion is more efficient the shorter the distance in terms of wavelengths form the source to the surface. However, some theoretical analyses do not confirm the effect, and some theoreticians believe that the effect of spall is much larger than that of linear conversion at the free surface. Experimental laboratory and field data would help to resolve the problem. In particular a complete accounting of the energy from the source is needed. For example, if tin the linear case there is a reduction in amplitude of the fundamental and higher mode surface waves as the shot increases in depth, where does the energy go? Experimental results are desired for both the linear and non-linear case. However, it is clear that the linear problem must be experimentally solved first, and that the non-linear problem may involve experimentally difficult problems related to medium destruction, yield scaling, and effects of gravity. Phase I –Outline the experimental plan for Phase II and the experimental techniques illustrated by the acquisition of good data for a few depths. Compare the data with theoretical linear predictions.

ACT devices are sampled analog signal processing elements similar in some respects to both charge-coupled devices and surface acoustic wave devices, but without the more serious limitations of either of those older technologies. The devices demonstrated to date or under development include digitally programmable transversal filters, fixed and programmable vector processors, correlators, analog memories, convolvers, and various hybrid structures. These devices all offer extremely wide bandwidths and dynamic range, low noise operation, and the advantages of implementation as monolithic gallium arsenide integrated circuits. Ultimately, the integration of ACT devices with digital processing elements on the same chip will provide extremely powerful and compact processor structures. The application areas for ACT devices include radar and radar electronic countermeasures, electronic support measures, and communications systems. The devices allow for enhanced performance of conventional concepts as well as making possible new, innovative approaches. Proposals which address the exploitation of ACT technology and devices for military systems are of current interest to DARPA.

In addition, modern forces can be expected to take full advantage of cover, concealment, and deception techniques.

In light of such efforts to reduce the effectiveness of conventional systems, DARPA is interested in examining unconventional sensing concepts which, though perhaps less capable in a general sense, possess special characteristics which make them desirable or even required for target detection, tracking, or classification/identification. Such sensors may seek to exploit unusual target signatures which are perhaps unsupressed, or use a form of energy which is less affected by current conventional techniques.

The ""signal microprocessor” is a high capability, digitally programmable, integrated circuit which can process analog signals by mathematical computation, thereby providing the same type of functionality for analog signals as the traditional microprocessor does for digital data. Such a device combines analog processing speeds and simplicity with the programmable versatility traditionally attributed only to digital processing techniques. Indeed, the signal microprocessor can be implemented all-digitally as an integrated circuit surrounded by convertors, but even the currently available ACT-based microprocessor is 1,000times faster than any available digital version and can operate on signals in the video, IF, and RF frequencies while digital versions operate only at audio frequencies. Functionally, the ACT-based microprocessor can be represented as a digitally programmable transversal filter. A standardized unit provides 128 taps, currently available 6-bit tap weight accuracy, and 150 MHz bandwidth. The unit requires only external DC power and a standard PC printer interface for control. The hardware is supported by a user friendly software package which automatically and dynamically controls tap weighs in response to user objectives, specified in a wide variety of ways. Units can be stacked for greater accuracy or cascaded for more taps/delay lengths. It is clear that such a device presents a powerful capability that has application in a variety of military electronic systems. It is the intent of this topic to identify and demonstrate such applications.

The orientation becomes even more crucial as projectiles get longer and thinner. Even if the pitch and yaw cannot be precisely controlled, one may characterize the performance much more accurately if the orientation is known. Presently, the best way to get information on projectile orientation is through the use of orthogonal X-ray stations. This procedure can be laborious, clumsy and slow. Additionally, most test facilities are limited in the number of X-rays they can use.

Advanced over the past five years have reduced high temperature superconductors (Tc > 77°K) and the promise of room temperature materials. The potential exists for no cryogenically cooled devices to operate in the super conducting state under ambient conditions in space (either present materials or higher Tc materials). Potential application areas of interest for space systems include RF devices, sensors, hybrid microelectronics (super/semiconductor integrated circuits), superconductor device based microelectronics, and others.

Additionally, novel application in areas such as propulsion, spacecraft stabilization and attitude control, high density energy storage devices may facilitate new or improved capabilities for spacecraft.

The"" signal microprocessor"" is a high capability, digitally programmable integrated circuit which can process analog signals by mathematical computation, thereby providing the same type of functionality for analog signals as the traditional microprocessor does for digital data. Such a device combines analog processing speeds and simplicity with the programmable versatility traditionally attributed only to digital processing techniques. Indeed, the signal microprocessor can be implemented all-digitally as an integrated circuit surrounded by converters, but even the currently available ACT -based microprocessor is 1,000 times faster than any available digital version and can operate on signals in the video, IF, and radio frequencies while digital versions operate only at audio frequencies. Functionally, the ACT -based microprocessor can be represented as a digitally programmable transversal filter. A standardized item provides 128 taps, currently available 6-bit tap weigh accuracy, and 150 MHz bandwidth. The unit requires only external DC power and a standard personal computer printer interface for control. The hardware is supported by user friendly software package which automatically and dynamically controls tap weights in response to user objectives, specified in a wide variety of ways.

In the future, when advanced requirements and designs might dictate even more elaborate arrays, the receive site costs could become prohibitive. It is the intent of this topic to explore potential cost savings for such arrays by the innovative use of fiber optic technology, which may allow for radically new approaches in array design and construction.

The laser light is delivered by a fiber optic into the sensitive test environment where it is then converted to electricity by photovoltaic cells. Both gallium arsenide (around 800 nanometers) and alexandrite (755 nanometers) lasers are close to the peak spectral response of the photovoltaic cells. Presently, the required optical power of 25 Watts can only be delivered by the alexandrite laser. However, gallium arsenide diode lasers are much more efficient and are less cumbersome than the alexandrite laser. The typical continuous wave output of a gallium arsenide diode laser is around 1 Watt. Therefore, to use the more attractive gallium arsenide lasers as a method for coupling the output from numerous (greater than 25) diodes into a fiber optic is necessary.

It is preferred that the system use some characteristic unique to gun barrels (long metal tubes 3. to 4. in diameter). The original stated requirements were: scout vehicle optics capable of identifying a tank gun barrel (frontal aspect) that has not been fired for at least six hours, is located within a camouflaged defensive position, and is at least two kilometers (2km) away. The capability to detect but not identify the same target from four kilometers (4km +) is also required. Some early studies indicate that this requirement may be difficult to meet using solely optical means. Therefore, consider any means that promises to do the job. The following example is given to show that no means are ruled out: An acoustical probe wave is launched into the camouflaged area suspected of containing tank with guns. The gun barrels could act like an organ pipe and produce a strong acoustical signature at its resonant frequency. The system could then use microphones to listen (electronically) for the organ pipe resonance. This resonant frequency will depend on the length of the gun barrel but is expected to be in the range of 100 to 200 Hertz. Narrowband filters (bandwidth 1 to 5 Hertz) can be used to enhance the signal to noise ratio. The launch wave could be an impulse such as a gun being fired, or more economically from a commercially made cannon designed to scare blackbirds from strawberry fields. This device is expendable (about $500) and could be located away from the using unit. It could also double for use in psychological warfare; since the enemy would continue to wait for the other shoe to drop, sleep would be difficult. If it were desired to operate more covertly, a one second acoustical burst at 150 Hertz (but tunable) could be launched toward the suspect area. This sound might easily pass unnoticed by the enemy since hearing sensitivity is down 30 db at 150 Hertz as compared to the 1000 to 5000 Hertz. That is a 1000 fold advantage. If the hum were heard, the long wavelength makes it very difficult to perceive the location of the source. The source for this single frequency acoustical energy might be a powerful loud speaker, a motor driven diaphragm, or an air driven trumpet like horn. If gun barrel echoes were received, it is important that it be possible to locate the source of the echo. : This could be done by having two or more receivers which could time the arrival of the echoes. The arrival time would place the location some where along an ellipse having the sound launcher as one focus and the receiver as the other focus. With two receivers, there would be a second ellipse with a different focus. The gun is located where the two ellipses intersect. With three receivers there would be a confirming ellipse. This is an easy calculation for an ordinary personal computer. It should be noted that the same equipment could be used passively when the enemy fires the guns. The guns can be located even when the muzzle flash is not observed. This would also yield moderately accurate range information. The attenuation of sound may defeat this method at ranges greater than one kilometer. Phase I: Continue conceptual analysis initiated in house. Make sufficient field measurements to assure that the selected means is feasible and that adequate signal to noise will be available.

Typically linear arrays of detectors with less than 30 total detectors are used in these systems. These are scanning systems with small instantaneous fields of view. As the system optics scans the total field of view the detector elements are read out at extremely high rates. Conventional IR projection techniques cannot support the modulation of the IR signal outputs at the rate required for accurate HWIL tests of these systems. These performance limitations have forced the exclusion of the IR detectors from the HWIL simulations which are necessary to adequately assess weapon system performance. Therefore, innovative fast IR projection techniques are needed to overcome these limitations. Currently, IR laser diodes are available in the short to mid wavelengths which are fast enough to test these systems. However, low output power levels limit their utility. Accordingly, if power levels could be improved and extensions made into the long wavelengths, an IR projector capable of supporting HWIL tests of these systems could be developed.

This knowledge can be applied to the design of low cost, low weight instrumentation to detect the potential onset of icing condition so that evasive maneuvers can be taken. Technology investigations have identified new electrical and mechanical methods of removing ice from aircraft wing and tail surfaces. One of the most promising utilizes piezoelectric effects. Use of these technologies will be examined to produce a low cost weight ice detection and deicing system that would permit operation in an icing environment.
