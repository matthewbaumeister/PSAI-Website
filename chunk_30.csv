This is primarily due to the inefficient coupling of pumping energy used to excite the lasing medium to energy level required for the spontaneous and stimulated emission of photons to take place. Most solid state lasers are currently pumped using flash lamps. This is inefficient because of the broadband nature of the flash lamp being used to pump a laser medium with a narrow absorption band. The efficient conversion of flash lamp emissions to a more narrow bandwidth could increase efficiency. Laser diodes are a potential narrow band pump source. They have been used in pumping low power level Nd:YAG lasers in laboratory conditions. The laser diode temperature tenability makes temperature stability a critical issue. The ability to fabricate large laser diode arrays has yet to be adequately demonstrated. The lifetime of the laser pumping mechanism is another critical issue. The goal is the development of efficient laser pumping techniques with the ability to provide laser output power of at least 2 joules/pulse at 10 Hz over a three-year untended lifetime.

One approach to relieve this problem is to employ the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to accomplish some of the decision making formerly performed by the crew. This approach offers new challenges to the crew station designer, since the interface between new crew and the system must now accommodate the transfer of preprocessed information and decisions from on-board expert subsystems, as well as raw data. It is envisioned that the interface will have to support a high level, abstract dialogue, as well as the current type and level of information exchange. Accordingly, increased attention must be given to the design of the crew station from the perspective of cognitive engineering. An emerging discipline, known as Cognitive Science, has made significant advances in formulating cognitively based principles of work station design, especially in the area of display format construction. Several of these principles have been applied recently in the analysis and design of work stations in process control industries. Research and exploratory development is needed to apply and extend the advancements of Cognitive Science into the design of future crew stations. Specifically, the goals of the research are to develop validated design principles and methods from Cognitive Science perspective for use during conceptual design engineering. As a minimum, the methods should consist of 1. analysis tools to facilitate development of cognitively sound crew station concepts; 2. evaluation metrics to access the quality of a design in terms of speed/accuracy, problem formulation ability, coordination among AI cources, crew situation awareness attainment, and in general, dialogue quality; and 3. operator workload and total system performance.",284,1924,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/71035/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/71035/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,86.6 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:23:39,,,,,AF86-277_71035,DOD_SBIR_86_P1_C6_AF86-277,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:03.985174+00

These Thorndike-era principles were derived more from animal learning than from human learning, which makes them largely mechanistic in nature. Resulting training programs focus on objective aspects of learning and largely ignore the medicinal processes that underlie performance. Even so, training is usually fairly successful, but primarily because training developers and instructors go far beyond the mechanistic model of learning. The positive results obtained by instructors spring from their personal experience and intuition that a lot more goes on during kill acquisition than the purely observable behaviors that are the primary focus in current application of the Air Force Instruction System Design (ISD) process. With the present high level of interest in the Air Force regarding total training system design, an improved conceptual framework is needed to guide the use and design of aircrew training devices at all levels. Dr. William Spears (Seville Training Systems Corporation) recently completed a program with Naval Training and Equipment Center (MTEC) to develop a rationale for the design and use of part-test and lot-fidelity training devices (technical report). Cognitive and motor skills were analyzed in terms of modern information processing concepts to understand the mediational process involved in performance.

The laser energy is reflected back into a photovoltaic detector, where it is mixed with local oscillator laser radiation of a different frequency (on the order of a 50 megahertz (MHz) offset from the transmitting laser frequency) to generate an intermediate frequency (IF) for final signal processing. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL), has developed a carbon monoxide (CO) transmitter laser which can be rapidly tuned over the entire P-branch of the CO band (on the order of milliseconds (ms)). However, the local oscillator has not been able to change frequencies with the transmitter to give a stable IF.

The transmitter is airborne and the passive receiver is either airborne or ground-based. The clutter may consist of rain, chaff and/or ground reflections; amplitude statistics may be Rayleigh, log-normal or Weibull distributed. The radar simulation should include flexible location schemes for a number of targets at arbitrary positions. The output would be the probabilities of detection of each target, for constant false alarm rates (CFAR processing).

In the event of an accidental release of toxic gases to the atmosphere, a ""toxic corridor‚Äù is calculated, based on output from an atmospheric diffusion model. The toxic corridor delineates the area requiring protective action (such as evacuation) due to gas concentrations exceeding specified limits. Model users need to know the uncertainty associated with calculating the toxic corridor; interest will be contained within the calculated corridor. The current Air Force operational atmospheric diffusion model, the Ocean Breeze/Dry Gulch (OB/DG) equation, is an experimentally derived method on a large number of test releases of a neutrally buoyant tracter. Because it is based on a large number of releases, confidence factors can be determined for its use, assuming the equation is used with scenarios identical to the releases used in it‚Äôs development. Newer models, operated on microcomputers, have been developed as potential replacements for OB/DG, which can be calculated manually with nomograms. The newer models incorporated improved model physics and include evaporation algorithms and techniques for simulating the release of heavier than air gases, while OB/DG does not. Despite these improvements, there is no straightforward way of calculating the uncertainty associated with these models. This uncertainty must be quantified before they can achieve widespread use within the US Air Force.

More efficient devices are needed to reduce their weight and energy consumption.

This has been attempted, but when the system is shut off the refrigerant creates great pressures as it worms, damages the vest, and leaks out.

Although line filters, environmental shielding, and careful experimental techniques will eliminate much of the signal corruption, uncorrelated noise from within the brain tissue corrupts the desired response to an unacceptable level.

One primary concern in these virtual man-machine interactions is the exploitation of new and creative approaches to presentation of situation awareness and other information to the pilot. It is our intention to explore the feasibility and benefits of dynamic holograms as a pilot to aircraft systems interface device. The need for improved situation awareness involves informing the pilot of other aircraft, ground threats and terrain in his area and their spatial relationship to his aircraft. A three-dimensional display would be ideally suited for this purpose, however, it would have to be generated for display in real-time. I.e., to 30 times per second depending on aircraft dynamics. Dynamic holograms have previously been accomplished through the use of motion picture film. The film medium, however, is not capable of responding to the pilot‚Äôs actions or to changing external conditions and is therefore unsuitable for application in a fighter cockpit. This research would involve a number of areas including holographic media materials, holographic generation, optical processing and dynamic holography applications. There are many applications for this technology. This technology could provide 3-D virtual imagery in the cockpit of future aircraft without the weight vs. display field of view and scene complexity constraints currently encountered with helmet display technology. Airborne situation awareness, threat response, target recognition and identification, mission effectiveness and survivability should be improved using this technology.

Environmental Reliability of Electronics Equipment. Environmental part stress screening is used during the production phase to transform latent part and workmanship defects in equipment into detectable failures for their elimination prior to delivery to the ultimate users of the equipment. Current practice is to establish the proper stress types, levels and durations by trial and error, experience, company policy and/or negotiations. If the environmental stress is too severe, too much useful life is consumed by the stress screening process. Weak stress screen will identify some latent defect allowing products containing defects to be delivered to the ultimate user. The net effect of current environmental stress screening techniques is that the shipped equipment contains fewer latent defects and displays a lower failure rate as the result of having been screened.

The throughput and multiplex advantages of the Michelson interferometer could be of great value in improving our ability to study ultraviolet atmospheric radiation from space platforms. The implications for doing so for wavelengths down close to 0.1 micrometer are a formidable degree of control of the placement of a moving mirror which must be positioned and translated with precision, repeatability and with adequate freedom from tilt and shear. In Phase I it is not required that this general capability be demonstrated with radiation of wavelengths as short as 0.1 micrometer. Rather, it is recommended that components be selected so that, with some convenient ultraviolet wavelength, a clear and convincing demonstration is made that the desired interferometer spectrometer performance at vacuum ultraviolet wavelength (at least 5 Angstrom resolution at 0.1 micrometers) is readily achievable with the proposed mirror drive and control for 25 mm optics.

There are two problems into which research and development is desired. One is high-speed imaging where specific goals are frame rates to 10,000 per second and resolution of at least 400 by 400 TV lines. Other areas to be addressed concerning high-speed imaging are sensitivity, dynamic range, spectral response, size, pixel geometry, gating for image capture, on-the-chip image processing, integral image storage buffers, and number of video outputs. The other problem needing research and development is high-resolution imaging for shadowgraph and similar instrumentation applications. The pixel density desired is 4096 by 4096 for high-resolution applications. Sensitivity is of concern because the sensor would typically be used in low-light situations or with short pulses of illumination. Other areas of interest concerning high-resolution imaging are spectral response, consistency on pixel geometry, physical closeness of pixels, long-term image storage ability, and gating for image capture. Of less concern for this particular application is video output rate (since only one frame high resolution data is required per camera), and shades of gray (since the picture would be shadowgraph, a binary sensor may be acceptable). Initial research efforts (Phase I) should result in evaluation of the most promising imaging chip architectures (including new architectures) and fabrication processes, expected values for each of the above areas of interest (including supporting derivations), and development cost estimates. The short-term goal (Phase II) is exploration of the most promising architectures to give proof-of-concept through hardware demonstration experiments.

Compatibility with direct optical sensor output and optically augmented electrical transducers is required. a. Current test techniques employing piezo-electrical and other electrical measurement techniques either do not have sufficient measurement bandwidth, are too expensive, or suffer from induced electro-magnetic effects. This effort is to investigate the application of fiber/electro-optic sensors within the explosive environment and/or embedded in the explosive material. Of particular concern or interest is the direct effect of the dynamic environment on the sensor or transmission medium itself and ways to exploit/prevent these effects as needed. The Phase I effort is a study of the effects of the explosive environment on the fiber and sensors, along with demonstration of experimental techniques for making measurements in both the transient and post event phases. The Phase II goal is to determine sensor and data transmission link design characteristics usable in explosive experiments via feasibility experiments. Phase III will be to fabricate and test prototypes and document the designs and results for use by the weapons development and test community. b. Large numbers of transducers are used to collect performance data about the munition or explosive device under test. As discussed above, to obtain the required performance data, new high bandwidth transducers are under investigation wherein the output is either directly a light signal or is converted at the transducer to a light signal for transmission through the severe test environment.

They employ advanced focal plane array technology and complex processing algorithms. However, the technology to effectively evaluate these systems has been lagging. There are no techniques currently available for simulating real-time broadband IR imagery. The majority of IR seeker testing involves large scale range testing. The problem with this approach is that test conditions are never exactly reproducible, and costs are high in time and money. The alternative to field testing is a laboratory test set-up. This would offer the advantage of repeatability of test parameters and lower cost. However, current IR display devices lack sufficient dynamic range and resolution. Some IR display devices which are being considered are the Bly Cell, the IR light valve, and the thermoelectric array. The Bly cell has been proven feasible in providing dynamic IR scenery in the 3-12 um waveband. However, current generation Bly Cells suffer from relatively low resolution (less than 4 cy/mm) and low dynamic range (max 70 degrees delta temp). The objective of Phase I of this program is to investigate methods to improve resolution, dynamic range, time constant, and methods of driving the Bly Cell so as to produce flicker-free IR imagery.

Fragmentation tests are required for high explosive munitions, such as small-caliber ammunition, cluster submunitions, bombs and bomlets, rocket and guided missile warheads, etc. There are two main devices presently used to obtain this data. A thin velocity screen is placed a known distance from the explosive and each time a fragment passes through, a pulse is produced. The time of flight and distance to explosive are used for determining velocity. Behind these velocity screens are large recovery boxes made of wood fiberboard or granular vermiculite. These materials are stacked thick enough to stop the heaviest expected fragment. There are two main problems with this system. First, thousands of man-hours are needed to set up the test, record each fragment hit, weigh each fragment, and analyze the data. The second problem is that this system limits the data that can be taken to a few degrees wide, fan-shaped area. There are requirements to take data from various orientations around the explosive including directly above it. For Phase I, innovative techniques for obtaining fragment mass, velocity and spatial distribution data are needed.

One approach that has been investigated is to combine two or more compounds which are by themselves not adequate explosives but when intimately mixed form a eutectic mixture which exhibits better explosive properties than any of the individual components. These eutectic explosives are also known as intermolecular explosives. Most eutectics studied to date utilize ammonium nitrate as the oxygen contributing component and nitrogen-containing organic nitrate salts as the explosive fuel (e.g. ethelenediamine dinitrate, guanidine nitrate, diethylenetriamine trinitrate). Only a handful of intermolecular explosives have been studied to any degree and although they perform well, they are still not insensitive enough to meet the IHE criteria. Many other intermolecular explosives which may perform well and exhibit the required insensitivity have not been studied by need to be. Intermolecular explosives are also used in two other types of melt-cast explosives: (1) intermolecular eutectic emulsion explosives and (2) intermolecular slurry explosives. New intermolecular explosives exhibiting a variety of physical, chemical and explosive properties are needed for these types of melt-cast explosives. The goal of Phase I is to find new intermolecular eutectic explosives which are melt-castable (80-110oC), which theoretically show an ability to perform well, and which exhibit thermal and impact insensitivity. When selecting new components emphasis must be placed first on the melting point of the resultant eutectics as these will be melt-cast systems (a eutectic composition melts at a lower temperature than any of the components).

These projectiles must be of thin wall design to insure maximum high explosive content and must utilize a relatively soft rotating band material to minimize barrel erosion and maximize gas sealing at 5000 ft/sec muzzle velocity. These projectile requirements, together with the requirement to reduce drag to an absolute minimum, necessitate the use of a plastic rotating band retained in a shallow depth (.020 inch) band-seat. The band material must be an injection-moldable thermoplastic capable of withstanding the high shock and torsional loads involved in projectile launch. The band seat retention technique must be a simple, reliable, inexpensive method of attaching the plastic band to the parent projectile. In Phase I, band seat fabrication methods, band/band-seat bonding and band materials will be studied with recommendations for materials and methods to be testing in Phase II where those materials/methods found to be most promising in Phase I will be tested on gun-fired projectiles.

Explosives are classified as 1.1 mass detonating, 1.2 non-mass detonating, 1.3 mass fire, and 1.4 moderate fire. Many military explosives fall in the 1.1 category. The most crucial test challenge is meeting the criteria of the non-detonating propagation test called sympathetic detonation. When one round of six bombs in a standard storage pallet is intentionally detonated, a detonation reaction must not propagate to neighbor rounds. The severity at which the neighbors react determines their hazard classification. Present methods to determine reaction severity of neighbor rounds include witness plate markings, warhead case fragment sampling and explosive collection. These methods, however, are often too crude when attempting to differentiate between a detonation or a deflagration. They do not distinguish the levels of reaction within each category which is of importance in setting quantity distance criteria. Thus, each explosive‚Äôs hazard area must be determined and then quantity distance calculated. In addition, as testing proceeds from a two body to a storage pallet (6 body) and a multiple pallet (6 pallets or 36 warheads for MK82 bombs) test, determining even the crudest of reaction severity and categorization is impaired due to the number of reacting items. The Phase I effort should examine and define the feasibility and engineering design of externally mounted (exterior of the bomb case) instrumentation and monitoring devices.

This model would then be integrated in the current radar fuze model to predict when the warhead would function so vulnerability estimates could be made and verified by empirical data.

This measuring system is the reference system for the evaluation of airborne navigation systems of the Department of Defense. About half the errors in the existing measuring system are due to the uncertainty in measuring the location of ground transponders to an absolute reference while the remaining half are due to uncorrected variations in the velocity of propagation. The requirement is to make real time measurement of the velocity of propagation between the ground transponder and the airborne interrogator. The Phase III requirement would be to propose a system to incorporate into a set of up to 150 ground transponders and an airborne interrogator making range and range rate measurements at a 10 Hz rate using S-band radio frequencies. b. A requirement exists for a general purpose Position Proximity Sensor (PPS). The sensor must deliver a discrete signal at the time of closest proximity. These reference system requirements include the high speed rocket sled test track, mobile test vans, precision centrifuges, rate tables, and linear displacement devices. The requirement is to produce discrete events at the time of closest approach of two predetermined objects.

The conversion of the measured radiant energy emitted to actual surface temperature requires that the spectral emittance of the surface be known for the sample material under test. Unfortunately, the emittance of most materials varies with temperature and is generally only available for room temperature conditions. By using the room temperature emittance values to convert measured radiance to surface temperature (as is currently done), significant errors can be made for tests performed in high temperature environments. Capabilities for measuring material emittance at elevated temperatures exist at other locations, such as Purdue University, NASA Langley and Lockheed Space and Missiles (Palo Alto, CA); however, each of these systems has drawbacks in terms of accuracy, temperature range, spectral range, and/or timeliness of response. A system for obtaining elevated temperature emissivity measurements should be capable of making measurements on relatively small material samples (2 in. diameter) at temperatures up to 2000 to 5000 degrees R. Spectral measurements are required over the range from 0 to 10 microns. Emphasis should be placed on achieving isothermal material sample conditions, minimizing errors due to radiant energy loss/gain, and providing a system which is affordable and sized for use as a piece of bench equipment in an existing thermal laboratory. The system described above may be pursued concurrently by AEDC via the Aerothermal Materials Technology Project (DC06).",243,1663,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67240/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67240/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,88.8 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:25:29,,,,,AF88-022_67240,DOD_SBIR_88_P1_C8_AF88-022,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:06.08631+00

The possibility of combining sophisticated silicon integrated circuit technology with the inherent high speed and optoelectronic capability of the III-V‚Äôs is especially attractive. In addition high quality silicon substrates are readily available at low cost with diameters that range up to ten inches. III-V substrates on the other hand are expensive, have orders of magnitude more defects, are limited to small diameter (2 or 3 inches) and are extremely fragile. Most of the recent research in this area is concentrated on the growth of GaAs on silicon. InP based alloys however have a high payoff potential for Air Force Photonic, Forecast II and space based applications such as MILSTAR and SDI.

Contact area must be reduced in size and the contacting probe must be controllable at low applied pressure.,"Contact Lead Technology developed in the silicon industry is inadequate for contacting III-V compound devices. Forces applied by soldering arms are sufficient to cause damage in these softer materials systems. High frequency operation is currently limited by the size and electrical characteristics of contacts formed by ball or wedge bonding. Low temperature operation and repeated thermal cycling to room temperature degrade device performance due to fatigue of the contact. Phase I should demonstrate a technology to reduce the size of bonds to less than 15 sq um with significant reduction in temperature and pressure. With the growing number of leads required by new chips, speed is also important.

While advances in virtual display technologies proposed for integration into future systems endorsed by the Air Force‚Äôs recent planning exercise, Project Forecast II, promise to alleviate the information overload problems, much remains to be done in the human engineering area. Programs in the following areas are of special interest: Situation awareness: Metrics and measurement techniques are needed for assessing the effectiveness of human-machine interface technology. The metrics should be empirically derived and must be appropriate for assessing the adequacy of human-machine coupling alternatives including virtual displays. Information coding principles: There is an interest in human-machine interface design based on the principles of icons and flow fields which convey properties of dynamic activities entailed in relevant environmental vents (external or internal to the system). This requires the application of knowledge and principles of Event Psychology. The challenge is to develop information codes which support a high degree of situation awareness despite momentary shifts in the man-in-the-loop simulations is desirable. Operator state feedback: Digital systems architectures currently permit measurements of hardware states and operator interactions hardware. New interface technologies, such as virtual display systems, will record data on hand, eye and head movements. Technology for non-invasive sensing of physiological signals is progressing. Now there is a need for algorithms, software and hardware to close the loop between system hardware states and human operator states in the operational environment. Automated analysis of physiological data in the presence of artifacts is challenging. Innovative techniques, rugged miniaturized hardware and automated analysis algorithms must be developed. Feasibility demonstrations and prototyping will be required. Hyper-media integration: There is a press for effective integration of multi-media information types in battle management and command-control-communication workstations. The application of virtual display concepts is anticipated.

This force information must be presented to the human in such a way that he can intuitively relate the forces acting on his arms to the forces acting on the robotic manipulators. Efforts are currently underway to develop a dual-arm exoskeleton system that can independently deliver forces and torques to each of the seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF) in the human arm. This system will allow man-in-the-loop control of a dextrous end-effectors attached to six DOF robotic arms. Successful implementation of this exoskeleton controller requires the development of algorithms to transform the vectors measured at the wrist plate of the robotic arm into force vectors that can be applied to the human arm by the actuators on the exoskeleton. The transformation algorithms will receive input in the form of six force and movement vectors Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz. The output will be in the form of seven torque vectors that can be applied to the seven DOF in the human arm: shoulder flexion/extension, forearm pronation/suppination, wrist flexion/extension and wrist abduction/adduction. The forces to be delivered to the human arm should enable the operator to perceive that his arms are experiencing the same forces as the robotic arms. Also of interest are tactile stimulation mechanisms operating in a virtual or telepresence environment that measure and communicates stimulation in three-dimensional space. These mechanisms should be capable of being used within a virtual cockpit where virtual images of discrete cockpit switch locations or control panels are projected and displayed in a helmet-mounted display, and stabilized in space using a helmet-mounted sight. An example would be piezoelectric materials embedded in gloves providing various forms of tactile feedback to the operator indicating switch contact and activation in virtual space.

Historically, FLIRs have undersampled because of the small number of detectors available on the focal plane arrays/FPAs, and the fact that the human brain can compensate for the aliasing artifacts in the imagery. However, FPA detector densities have improved and ATRs are sensitive to alaising. As a result, sampling a rate is now considered to be a critical design parameter. The correct values for various applications are the subject of an industry wide debate that is being discussed at national conventions such as the Infrared Information Symposium (IRIS) and the Automatic Target Recognizer Working Group (ATRWG). New FLIR design and performance figures of merit are being proposed. However, there is no way to verify then since all existing sensors are limited to one sample rate by the detector size and spacing on the FPA and/or scanner limitations. In Phase I of this effort, an innovative design for a variable sample rate laboratory FLIR will be developed. Approaches which may not be practical for operational FLIRs such as combining a staring FPA with a step-stare two axis scanner, are acceptable to achieve the variable sample rate feature. The FLIR must generate non-uniformity corrected, non-interlaced video at 525 TV line rates. High frame rates are desired so that the data can be displayed to an operator iwhtout image tearing artifacts. The detector and aperture sizes should be selected to provide anti-aliasing filters.

In such a radar, a complex weighting is computed from the covariance of the antenna array element outputs to maximize the target-to-interference ratio in a particular space-time direction. The array/filter weights can be described as forming a retrodirective receive beam in the direction of a source of interference. Subtraction of the retrodirective beam pattern from the normal, unadapted pattern will effectively null out the source of interference. Aircraft motion induced clutter Doppler shift is compensated for by incorporating a digital delay line in each of the elements and adaptively employing Displaced Phase Center Antenna (DPCA) techniques in order to make the radar antenna appear stationary. Conventional radar detection processing, consisting of the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) and Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR), may follow. Data-adaptive radar processing methods are generally applicable to optimum measurement of environmental parameters, the rejection of correlated interference, and system calibration. Specific tasks include resolving and tracking multiple targets in the antenna main beam, clutter rejection, multipath rejection, jammer rejection, and system calibration. Space-time adaptive radar processing techniques afford optimum performance in particularly applicable to airborne interceptor radars operating at the lower frequencies and, hence, incorporating conformal array antennas with correspondingly few elements but large power-aperture products.

A key enabling technology for meeting these requirements is leaning systems. Learning systems technology is a recently emerging area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and includes three general approaches to real-time adaptation: Neural Learning, Evolutionary Learning, and Distributed Rule-Based Learning. The first two use concepts from neurophysiology and evolutionary biology respectively, the last approach relies on the formal and informal logic based techniques of mainstream AI and incorporates concepts of Distributed AI for real-time potential. In general, electronic combat avionics applications from the point where the aircraft meets its environment with its sensors, emitters, and radars up to the situation assessment module of whatever cockpit management system is in place (e.g. Pilot‚Äôs Associate) will be explored. This program will thus complement the Pilot‚Äôs Associate program and other cockpit centered programs.

Determination of Distributed Object Representation, Prediction and Matching Techniques for Model Based Vision. Current object recognition approaches in vision focus upon the use of massively parallel architectures to extract object features such as edges and homogeneous regions from imagery. The prediction of each object features, the representation of these features, and the matching of these predicted features with image (e.g., infrared, synthetic aperture radar) features is generally performed as a single process on a single CPU. This research will investigate approaches to use massively parallel architectures for: (1) Storing distributed representations of objects; (2) Performing predictions (infrared, radar) from these objects; (3) Storing the predicted object representation (i.e., an object view); and (4) Matching the distributed object view with a distributed feature representation derived from the image (in this context, distributed representations refer to one object, view, etc., being represented on many processors). Phase I activity will be limited to concept formulation and validation via implementation and testing on Government furnished massively parallel hardware. b. Determination of Processing Requirements for Expert Systems Using Machine Intelligence. The projected use of expert systems will require orders of magnitude improvement in processing throughput to achieve real time airborne operation. The use of parallel processing in conjunction with the high speed microcircuitry is a potential solution. In order to prepare for the eventual integration of an advanced developmental configuration, design tradeoffs leading to the identification of desired system characteristics need to be accomplished in the near term. Phase I activity will include surveys of available algorithms and available parallel processing machine configurations. The relative merits of each type of hardware/operating system design will be judged in terms of their adequacy in supporting, principally, selected expert system software applications.

This would entail gathering data on the optical signature and performance characteristics of a US aircraft, and the performance of a visually diverted threat anti-aircraft system. A system would then be devised to use this data, with the AFWAL Optical Reduction Image Processing System (ORIPS), to demonstrate the kinds of signature reduction that could be achieved through situational awareness. ORIPS can be used to generate the visual scenes (as would be viewed by the threat) with both a normal flight profile and one modified to take advantage of situational awareness.

Moreover, the potential structural integrity monitoring and control payoffs of the smart structures concept over current structural integrity monitoring and active control systems needs to be defined. The objectives of the Phase I effort are to fully define the smart structures concept, identify the sensor requirements and deficiencies in current sensor technology, define real-time data acquisition and analysis requirements, define active control requirements, and define the required decision making architecture.

A critical element for both types of systems is the wing leading edge which must survive and maintain structural integrity in an aeroheating environment capable of generating radiation equilibrium temperatures on the order of thousands of degrees F. Of the two types of systems, however, the reusable mission vehicle imposes the greater technical challenge in the sense of having to maintain leading edge moldline contours and structural integrity under severe repetitive thermal and mechanical loading. The emphasis of this effort will be on the development of multi-mission leading edge concepts capable of sustaining maximum radiation equilibrium temperatures of between 4000o F and 5000o F. Cooling techniques may be employed, but only to the minimum extent required to enable maintenance of structural and material system integrity for a given concept. The philosophical approach is thus that less cooling is preferable to more cooling, whereas no cooling (active), if possible, would be most desirable for system simplicity (and hence reliability) and ease of maintenance. Stated equivalently, the goal should be to push to the limits of materials technology and then actively cool.

(b) Most of the problems are loosely defined, open-ended, virtually none of which has singular, unique solution, but all of which must be solved. The solutions are less than optimal and are called satisfying solutions. (c) There are multiple measures of merit for judging the ""goodness‚Äù of the design, all of which may not be equally important. (d) All information required may not be available. (e) Some information may be hard, that is, based on scientific principles and some information may be soft, being based on the designer‚Äôs judgement and experience. The ultimate engineering scheme must be based on life-cycle considerations to include both the ""process-of-design: and the many ""disciplines‚Äù which must be invoked during the process. The goal of life-cycle engineering is to design ""optimum‚Äù or near-optimum‚Äù systems. Optimum is defined as a design that is feasible and also superior to a number of other feasible alternative designs. A superior design can be obtained in two ways: 1) by an iterative process, or 2) by solving an optimization problem. In the first way the design is improved through repeated modification and the values of the design variables are changed or made firm sequentially. The process relies heavily on interaction with the designer who has to use his experience-based insight to guide the solution process. In the later, all the design variables are determined simultaneously so as to satisfy a set of constraints and optimize a set of objectives. External intervention by the designer is necessary only if the problem formulation or the input data are to be altered. The preferred process is the later because it frees the designer of tedious data gathering and forces more objective solutions. In addition, the autonomous behavior of such a design aid may extent to adaptive or self-improving performances, real-time interaction with distributed databases and expert systems, and automatic generation/translation of design variables into mathematical expressions for algorithmic computation.

Advanced engine test programs are limited by the problems associated with current structural instrumentation capabilities. The state-of-the-art of structural instrumentation has many shortcomings in both the strain gage and thermocouple areas. Current turbine engine tests are particularly impaired by the fact that present instrumentation is commonly temperature limited, short lived, inaccurate, and either protrudes into the gas flow stream or requires trenching the structural component in order to embed the sensor. For these reasons, new sensors/systems capable of surviving the harsh environments of a turbine engine while providing accurate strain and/or metal temperature data are required.

The Vanguard methodology includes offensive counterair, defensive counterair, the suppression of enemy air defenses, and tactical air-to-surface components. Each submodel stands alone and is not evaluated in concept with the other components. In addition to the lack of model integration, many conceptual systems are difficult to or cannot be analyzed with current methodologies. For example, the disruptive effects of jamming drones, mine warfare weapons cannot be evaluated in the current methodology. The tactical air-to-surface methodology includes only destruction of targets (i.e., percentage of required target set killed) as a measure of merit and ignores the remaining air interdiction mission components of delay, disruption, and diversion. In general, Vanguard as well as the tactical analytic community would benefit from an integrated modeling tool which evaluates the previously mentioned submission areas with the ability to include a host of conceptual systems as well as traditional weapon/airframe/avionics contributions. A Phase I effort would consist of the development of a matrix and supporting data base of existing/proposed methodologies which addresses each of the submission areas. Because cost for the development and integration of the various submission areas methodologies is a prime consideration, this matrix should consist primarily of Government owned models. This data bank should, at a minimum, include the inputs, sources for inputs, hardware and software requirements, current users, the developer, analytic purpose and the outputs for each model. This data bank should then be analyzed for recommendations on the best course of action for integrating the submission area models into a single model. The proposal should also include steps necessary and the requirements necessary to integrate the final product into the tactical Vanguard process. The matrix and data bank should include ""best weapons,‚Äù the current Vanguard modeling tool, as a standard of comparison.

This is mainly due to the inability of such simulations to present follow on interactive events without using costly and often nonoptimum manpower to control the actions of the required threat. Since most tactical combat scenarios require large numbers of man interactive threats to achieve realism and combat training objectives, a possible solution is to automate these threats by using current computer capability and technology. The initial task required is to conduct a literature search and then define threat performance parameter standards, algorithms, and rule based performance options based on perceived cueing and mission objectives. The contractor must then create a generic software product which will integrate all of these factors into a rule based, real time interactive program compatible with current simulator technology. The generic model should include ground based and airborne threats and replicate the search, acquisition, sort, engage, flyout and disengage profiles applicable to the threat envelopes. The outcome of this effort will be a reproducible software program that can be selectively applied to specific programs and needs within combat training systems throughout the Air Force.

When the mixer is saturated, spurious lines or intermodulations appear thereby decreasing the detection signal/noise ratio, and the signal detection gain. It is very difficult to suppress the jamming signals with the receiver electronics since they are in the same band as the signal. However, if the mixer has a large dynamic range so that it will not be saturated by the jammer, then techniques exist in the receiver to suppress the jamming. Mixer analyses use the principle that the second-order term is responsible for intermediate frequency conversion for the desired signals.

Current and planned space systems project the increased use of bipropellant systems, replacing the older hydrazine engines. A bipropellant system provides more energy per unit of propellant mass than a monopropellant system. This makes N2O4 an attractive alternative but it can cause clogging of filters and valves in the propulsion system. This clogging can render propulsion subsystems useless, resulting in the loss of the spacecraft. The reduction of dissolved iron, water, chlorides, and non-volatile particulates can essentially eliminate this clogging problem. Yet, current production methods yield N2O4 with undesirably high levels of these impurities. Catalytic combustion of ammonia, however, yields inherently pure N2O4. This process has been demonstrated in the laboratory, so the technical challenge lies in scaling-up the process for production. This scaling-up can be divided into two steps which nearly fit the division between Phase I and Phase II of the SBIR Program. The end product of Phase I should be a flow diagram which describes the process for producing N2O4 by catalytic combustion of ammonia. It should include pressures, temperatures, and flow rates for all steps in the process.

Specific solutions of time scaling and intervals between animation scenes is left to the contractor. For first cut analysis, time precision on the order of a minute and spatial precision on the order of 10 km should be sufficient. In order to promote widespread use, it is desirable that the Phase I product be compatible with an AT class machine running MS DOS with a graphics board and a math to-processor. Image display need not be more elaborate than that necessary to show continental boundaries on earth and bright points for satellites or stars. The Phase I product should indicate the terminator on the earth, positions of the sun, moon, planets and at least 10 satellites. The model should be constructed to allow potential upgrades and enhancements for Phase II such as major political boundaries, star field with galactic plane indicator, database of greater than 100 satellites, ability to change the viewport size and direction while the simulation is running, and the capability to form population histograms according to the criteria as fraction of orbit illuminated by the sun and nearest neighbor over a given period of time.

Elaborate multiplier chains in conjunction with highly stabilized low frequency sources are traditionally used. These schemes have serious drawbacks since close-in phase noise increases 6 dB with each octave of multiplication. However, fundamental microwave frequency sources utilizing GaAs MESFETs, which currently dominate both hybrid and Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, have considerable shortcomings as well. Although these devices exhibit high gain and low noise figure at microwave frequencies and are readily integrated into monolithic circuits, GaAs MESFET oscillators traditionally exhibit substantially higher FM noise than comparable Si bipolar transistor or Gunn diode components. This has been attributed to the higher l/f noise of the FET devices. The latter elements are, unfortunately, not suitable for monolithic integration. A monolithic low noise fundamental frequency phase lockable oscillator based on a low l/f noise monolithic compatible microwave device technology is therefore necessary to satisfy the requirements for advanced military communications systems at 20 and 44 GHz such as MILSTAR and advanced DSCS.

Two approaches are available to address this problem: innovative control techniques and ""smart‚Äù structures. The Air Force is interested in developing both innovative on-orbit system identification and shape/vibration control techniques for large space systems. There is a need to develop system identification methods which can adequately identify large flexible space structures on orbit in real-time or near real-time.

The control system must have a bandwidth capable of suppressing vibration modes that influence the particular parameter of interest. For example, line-of-sight-error for space-based laser type systems or RMS shape error for space-based radar type systems. Finally, the control and identification techniques must have the capability to be implemented in the space environment.

A rocket nozzle, for example, has bondlines that may have separations on the order of 1 to 2 mils that could be detrimental to the survivability of the vehicle that the nozzle is attached to. This also holds true for the solid rocket motor propellant/insulator/case bondlines. With current display monitors we can only see a separation if it lies within a whole pixel, so there is a distinct difference visible to the human eye.

In each manufacturing process, there is the problem of vulcanization by-products, which exude from the insulation into the chemically sensitive solid propellant grain. Insulation ingredients which have been found to be detrimental to the integrity of the propellant/insulation bondline include thiourams (sulfur activators), chlorowax and other processing aids, alcohol by-products from peroxide cures, residue from solvent wipes, and the ever-present water in the rubber layers. It is important to extract all unreacted, migratable species and vulcanization by-products from the insulation prior to the propellant casting step. One method would be to apply a soft, absorptive polymer coating to the insulation to extract undesirable species from the insulation and prevent contamination and human error during process. Development of this protective coating is expected to dramatically improve system reliability through reduced bondline ingredient variability and post-processing reactions.

Also, with Project Forecast II, the Air Force has identified several requirements for very precise absolute and relative positioning of satellites, as well as precise satellite navigation and orientation. Similar precision surveillance capabilities to track cooperative targets are required by the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The Global Positioning System (GPS) of satellites, in concert with a variety of satellite-borne instrumentations, has the potential to satisfy all of these requirements. The technical challenges associated with the use of GPS for Air Force applications in space include deriving the maximum accuracy from a system that provides a given, but diverse, set of data (code and phase measurement); combining GPS receiver measurements with measurements from other ancillary instruments, such as multiple-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes, and star trackers; and developing computer software that exploits and enhances this synergism to meet Air Force needs. Applications relying on solutions to these challenges include gravitational field determinations, precise inter-satellite distance, velocity, and acceleration determinations, and precise relative orientation of satellites in distributed arrays. Phase I of the project involves the delineation of (1) enhancements to existing GPS-based techniques to determine the earth‚Äôs gravitational field, as well as very precise absolute and relative positions, velocities, and accelerations of lower earth-orbiting satellites; (2) the synergism of GPS and ancillary instrumentation required to satisfy the position and orientation requirements of Air Force systems in space; and (3) all error sources of the various instrumentations under consideration with proposals to reduce major errors.

The reduction of the satellite radiance data to temperature profiles involves both difficult mathematical inversion analysis as well as complicated data processing.

Injection locking individual lasers to master laser that is frequency stabilized has been demonstrated experimentally with large gas lasers and more recently on semiconductor lasers by Morgensen et al (830 nanometers CSP, and 1.3 micrometers BH lasers). Experiments have shown it necessary to optically isolate the master laser from the slave laser to prevent unwanted feedback. Faraday rotators, which alter the polarization of light, have been used as optical isolators but are generally too large to be used conveniently in an integrated package with semiconductor lasers. To efficiently injection lock many diode lasers, a small scale optical isolator must either be designed to be incorporated into an optical fiber carrying the injection signal or fabricated directly onto a semiconductor substrate in conjunction with the fabrication of slave laser diodes. Another technique for coupling a number of diodes is to use single mode optical fibers bundled to form a common external cavity.

In this approach, the interaction between the fundamental constitutive units of the systems are not accounted for. Hence, is not suitable for understanding the initiating and evolution mechanism governing soil deformation. If this is to be achieved, an understanding of and mathematical description for the physics at the microstructural level must be developed. Research in soil microstructure has followed two paths; a mechanistic approach investigating purely granular material, and an experimental approach using microscopy techniques for investigating cohesive soil. Although these studies have provided valuable information on the response mechanisms at the micro level, they do not address the behavior of real soils. Real soils are a complex composite of solids, air, and liquid with response characteristics greatly dependent on stress history. To date, no mathematical model based on microstructural features has been developed to predict the response of this complex system. In recent years fractal geometry has been successfully used to recreate natural features. Because fractal geometry can describe shape and potential sequence development in a noncontinuous process it may be able to describe the soil deformation process from a microstructural perspective. This will be a new area for fractal analysis. The Civil Engineering Research Division of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL/NTE) has a long term responsibility to develop methods of estimating geologic material response in blast and shock environments. The response of survivability and vulnerability of land based systems. Fractal analysis can contribute to the understanding of geologic material response by a) identifying how internal state variables affect response, b) identifying initiating damage mechanisms, and c) establishing the ability to track damage evolution during deformation. This knowledge will allow material models to be developed from a physical rather than a phenomenological basis.

Such measurements at the HE-earth interface must necessarily be made remotely with sensors in the hostile environment the data signals are conducted through long underground electrical cables to a recording location. Shock-induced effects and inherent cable characteristics invariably alter the data signals. Consequently, the recorded signals may be significantly different from the signals which actually occurred at the sensor. It is known that installing an electronic signal amplifier with the sensor will significantly reduce signal alteration enabling the recorded data to more accurately reflect the actual signal. This topic is for investigation of integrated circuit, hybrid, and/or other circuit design, fabrication, and packaging technologies to result in a miniature, high performance, hardened, conditioner/amplifier. The technical challenge is to produce a ""see-and-forget‚Äù unit to be installed with resistance bridge blast pressure transducers at the sensing location. Specifically, the unit in a 10 cubic inch cylindrical package would provide settable excitation, gain, zero, and single-step calibration. A minimum 3 db bandwidth of 100 kHz with minimum slew rate of 100 volts/microsecond, maximum settling time to 0.1% of 100 nanoseconds and at least two-port isolation is required when driving a load of 10kOhm in parallel with 0.98 mfd. Operating ambient environment includes temperatures 30o to 130oF, dust, and moisture. Transient environment at the sensor includes 100k psi, intense thermal flash, vertical shock acceleration to 100 kg, 0.5 msec duration, and will occur up to 30 days after installation. Operation with a single 4-cond shielded cable is desired. Phase I products of this effort are electro/mechanical performance specification and descriptions, complete design drawings, and one operating prototype package for proof-testing.

When evaluating the results of these tests, the engineer has two primary sources of information; actively recorded instrumentation, such as strain sources and accelerometers; and visible damage, such as the presence of cracking, spalling, and permanent deformations. Much more information could be obtained if there were a way to determine the extent of damage mechanisms which are not readily apparent during a visual inspection. Damage, such as microcracking, debonding of the steel and the cement-aggregate matric, are important but are not measured with existing technology. Phase I of this effort would be the theoretical evaluation of appropriate measurement systems. A strong knowledge of material science and instrumentation systems will be required for this portion. The system selected for Phase II development will have to be portable, non-destructive and be capable of being deployed on only one side of a cross-section since the other side will frequently be inaccessible. Phase I will also involve the development of a test plan for validation of the measuring technique. Phase II will involve the final hardware design and testing of a prototype unit.

We can also determine TOA at high pressures using existing pressure gages. However, due to cost and technical limitations, these methods are of little use in the free field environments we typically monitor for shock tubes and other explosions. WE need a simple, inexpensive, and self-contained gage (device) and recorder to accurately record the charge initiation and the TOA of the pressure front. It must be stressed that devices measuring dynamic pressure (flapper switches, etc.) are unacceptable since a dynamic pressure threshold would be exceeded much later than desired. The gages themselves can be single use while the recorders should be designed for multiple uses. Recorder protection would typically consist of burial near the gage with retrieval one to four hours after the explosion. Consideration should also be given to designing a single recorder that can accommodate several gages spaced hundreds of feet apart. In all cases, these gages and recorders should be designed for placement by 2-man crews 2 to 48 hours before the explosion. Phase I: Identify potential gage solutions and candidate recorder systems. Examine recorder systems used by the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL), the University of New Mexico Civil Engineering Research Facility (CERF), and others to determine their compatibility with potential TOA gage systems.

If a diesel power system is to be a viable source of power, a closed cycle system will be necessary. Engine characteristics common in industrial diesels will require optimization to qualify as an endurable and isolated power source. Of particular importance are the thermal efficiency, the reliability after long idle periods and thermal loading of the surroundings. A closed cycle will depart from convention in order to achieve higher thermal efficiency and eliminate contamination of the local atmosphere by completely recycling the combustion gases. Carbon dioxide in the exhaust stream is chemically absorbed, (or used as a diluent), the gases are cooled and the input stream then replenished with oxygen from stores. Issues to be addressed include the choice of the best fuel working fluid combination, the method of oxygen storage, organic scrubber technology, fuel purity, engine blowby and soot contamination, system control, waste heat recovery, and the method of control of the working fluid to prevent participation in the combustion and to minimize extraneous stores. Some examples of oxidants are compressed oxygen, liquid oxygen, or hydrogen peroxide. Sensing elements which act to control the oxygen levels and flow stream temperatures will have a direct bearing on the cycle efficiency.

Traditionally, through the earth signal propagation and reception was thought ill suited for the high data rate, low bit error rate requirements for launch control communications and C3I. However, recent works would indicate that data transfer rates or the order of a few kilobits per second can be achieved with relatively low bit error rates. There is also the possibility that data transfer rates can be attained when nonlinear signal processing techniques are incorporated in the scheme. The technical challenge is to define mobile multi-band transceiver concepts that could provide post-attack connectivity via signal propagation/reception through rock/soil. Such a system should be compatible with existing WWMCCS platforms and should be capable of maintaining launch control communications with mobile launcher assets deployed on the surface. Phase I should define and characterize mobile multi-band transceiver concepts.

The leakage of any of these would present a severe hazard to the environment. Storage facilities should be capable of reducing or eliminating vaporization, hydrogen embrittlement, contamination of the stored chemical, and boil off. The transport of chemicals into underground storage is another hazardous situation that requires a solution. Development and testing of chemical storage alternatives is also of extreme interest and it is acceptable for the Phase I and II efforts to be devoted entirely to addressing this area of technology rather than storage facility technology. One other alternative is to generate hazardous chemicals at the point of need from relatively innocuous chemicals. Of particular interest is to develop and test a method of: 1) hydrogen generation/reformation (possibly using hydrochloric acid and iron pellets), and 2) oxygen generation (utilizing hydrogen peroxide, perchlorate candles, etc.).

Enhanced computing and methods of artificial intelligence will play a significant role in developing such control systems, as will development of computer vision. Basic research is required in several areas related to this topic. Mathematical models are required for many of the systems of interest, including those occurring in propulsion, robotics, and laser optics. Effective mathematical understanding, using both analytical and numerical tools, is needed for nonlinear equations such as those for transonic flow, laser focusing, detonation, stability of shear flows, geometrically exact elasticity, and nonstandard viscoelastic media. For example, models and a basic understanding of damping mechanisms in materials to be used in space structures are needed. Related to this issue is the need for better simulation methods. Novel approaches to simulating complex systems, such as cellular automata, will be explored. Any such approach should be closely coupled to the physical processes which are being simulated. Research is needed in several areas of mathematical control theory. Control of complex problems in robotics will likely require advances in adaptive control theory. Control of flexible systems will require advances in the theory of distributed parameter control. Research should address novel methods for dealing with nonlinear dynamics as well as model uncertainty and robustness. Control theories should be applicable to control of systems occurring in large space structures, robotics, or flow control. Artificial intelligence approaches may be combined with control theory in order to control complex decentralized systems. Research in intelligent control methods, which couples these two approaches is needed. Advances in software engineering and knowledge-based systems will be needed to implement computational models and control algorithms. Research is needed in knowledge-based systems with improved mechanisms for temporal reasoning for application to real-time critical problems. Research in software engineering should address issues of reusability, better programming environments, and the need to monitor changes dynamically. Improvements in image processing should attempt to exploit the common mathematical framework provided by spatial statistics or employ the complementary approach to using expert systems. Research is needed to apply Bayesian approaches to capturing prior knowledge to accelerate and improve the imaging process. An interdisciplinary approach to this class of problems will enhance the research efforts. For example, control of structural problems requires research in continuum mechanics as well as control theory. Robotics problems will require modeling of complex structures and systems, control theory, and methods of artificial intelligence.

Enhanced geomagnetic activity is one manifestation of disturbance of the magnetosphere called a magnetopheric substorm. Associated phenomena are aurora, x-rays, particle participation, ionospheric perturbations and geomagnetic pulsations. Geomagnetic pulsations are magnetic fluctuations with periods ranging from about a second to ten minutes. A key element in understanding magnetospheric activity is to find a phenomenon which characterizes such disturbances and is related to changes in the structure and composition of the near-Earth space environment occurring during a magnetospheric substorm. Geomagnetic pulsations may provide such a phenomenon since they may indicate the natural or resonant periods of geomagnetic field lines and component parts of the magnetosphere. If these pulsations represent the characteristic periods of the Earth‚Äôs magnetized plasma environment, they should offer a means of determining changes in the magnetosphere. As the properties of the magnetosphere change with the changing geomagnetic activity, there should be changes in the magnetic pulsations. Geomagnetic pulsations may be characteristic sound of the magnetosphere. These signals may provide a diagnostic tool but they also may afford an early warning system for magnetospheric substorms. Phase I should seek to answer the following questions: (1) Do global resonant oscillations of the magetosphere exist? (2) Do local or field line oscillations exist? (3) Are the properties of the oscillations significantly related to specific magnetospheric parameters? (4) Do the oscillations occur regularly enough to provide useful magnetospheric parameters?

These storage locations are prime targets because an impact (detonation) in the storage area could cause one weapon to detonate, and could potentially detonate the remainder of the weapons in the storage area. The storage areas are high-value targets due to the relatively low cost (one weapon) and high yield of a successful mission. The Air Force is developing a blast mitigation system to reduce the probability of large-scale fratricide in storage areas. The mitigation system consists of physical barriers in contact along the length of, and in contact with adjacent bombs along with a rectangular block mounted at the center of the rectangular array formed by four bombs.

The processor to be developed from this interceptor must be able to withstand a harsh storage and launch environment and must have a shelf life of up to ten years in orbit. The ability to perform prelaunch checkout of the processor is limited due to the extremely short engagement times for the interceptor. Also, the endgame processing rate requires that the processor be functional throughout this critical time.

They will suffer significant mechanical distortion due to their large size and lightweight. Such arrays will require self-calibration or self-cohering procedures in order to correct for this distortion. Two basic approaches to self-cohering have been suggested, self-survey and adaptive beamforming. Self-survey, using multiple laser ranging devices, calculates the position of all elements in an array, one to another. With accurate knowledge of element or subarray positions, phase correction can be made in order to focus and steer the array over wide angular sectors both on transmit and receive. Adaptive beamforming ignores the relative position of the elements and uses the phase measurement from a beamforming source to focus the array over a localized region around the source. Refocusing is necessary to cover extended angular regions. Both approaches have merit and drawbacks, suggesting that a combination of these techniques should also be considered.

A study of errors and the impact of errors on total system performance should be made, followed by the design of an experiment to demonstrate the two techniques for comparison.

Spall fragments of concrete flying off the inside of a wall occurs when a wall is subjected to high impulse blast loadings as produced by conventional weapons. The blast loading applied to the front surface of the wall travels through the concrete as a compressive wave and reflects off the back wall as a tensile wave. This produces tensil stresses which exceed the low tensil strength of the concrete traveling at velocities in the range of 100ft/sec. The localized spalling of concrete must be contained to prevent injury and damage to personnel and equipment occupying the structure. Phase I will determine the feasibility of a fiber-reinforced spall protection system for flatwall concrete structures. Phase II should identify and evaluate loading functions and geometric responses of a protective system, identifying potential system concepts and materials, and address the feasibility in a report.

For initial damage assessment on a large scale, develop a neural network that will be able to identify the damage caused to airfield pavements in the event of attacks. a. Time is a critical resource during rapid runway repair (RRR) minimum operating strip (MOS) selection and crater repair. Pavement upheaval is often difficult to recognize during visual inspection and current expedient measurement techniques take several minutes and are not as accurate as desired. A method/device is needed. This speed would be very helpful during MOS selection and final inspection of a finished repair, but it is critical during upheaval reduction efforts when the profile may be constantly changing. Too much upheaval reduction could result in an unacceptable sag which defeats the effort to salvage good pavement. The Phase I effort shall address system design and proposed prototype development and test plans. b. The determination of runway damage due to an attack on an airfield presents many problems. One problem is identifying the extent of the damage. Since damage assessment may well be required at night and the environment after the attack may be highly dangerous to personnel due to the presence of biological and chemical agents, area denial mines and unexploded ordnance, it is desirable to develop an unmanned system to initially survey the airfield system for damage. One essential part of this system is the ability to quickly make an accurate assessment of the damage without endangering personnel. This can be accomplished by a system that operates autonomously with the ability to identify damage. This project would use neural network technology to develop a system using infrared imaging to identify damage to the airfield. The airfield damage includes bomb craters, spalls, unexploded ordnance, and debris.

The instrument must be rugged, air transportable, and capable of rapidly analyzing soil, air, and water samples. Also, it should be capable of quickly tracking (in time and space) and monitoring unknown/known chemical contaminants and should require minimum training for qualified Air Force personnel. This equipment will be used to detect environmental pollutants and chemical warfare agents. Similarly, rugged field transportable equipment capable of nonintrusively determining droplet size is also required. a. New Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental laws have increased monitoring requirements and lowered detection limits for organic chemical contaminants, making existing real-time detection equipment obsolete. Additionally, spills/leaks of hazardous chemicals require rapid field response and evaluation to protect life and property. Rapid, innovative survey techniques and on-site chemical analysis are necessary to keep up with this growing demand. The research scheme should be: (1) evaluate emergency response capabilities of current commercially available instruments; (2) compare field analytical results with previously approved methods; and (3) develop valid on-site analytical protocols for routine Air Force chemicals. b. In order to sustain operations in a chemical warfare environment, the Air Force needs instrumentation which can detect surface chemical agent contamination on air base personnel and equipment. The instrumentation must quickly and accurately indicate the chemical agent type, amount, and location in order to determine the need for decontamination based on the potential for injury to personnel or damage to equipment. The equipment would be used to screen personnel in order to hasten entry into a contamination control area or toxic free area; its use must pose no hazards to personnel, including casualties with open wounds. The instrumentation will also be used to check equipment prior to loading onto a aircraft or to check interiors of aircraft or buildings; it must be capable of detecting agents in cracks and crevices. In both cases, the instrumentation must be capable of detecting low levels of all threat liquid agents without responding positively to decontaminants or any chemicals normally present on air bases. c. In order to determine age and persistence of chemical warfare agents, it is necessary to nonintrusively determine droplet size. It is not imperative that this information be real time, as accuracy is more important than response time. Droplet size measurement must be tied to at least gross analytical discrimination.

There are decisions made throughout the life cycle that impact health, safety, and environmental quality. Decisions made early in the design process may well drive subsequent system design, supportability, and operability. The Air Force needs a hazardous material identification database providing information on known hazardous materials in the Air Force inventory or in development. One possibility would be to use Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) to predict the likelihood of hazard for chemicals not in the database. Fundamental to such a database would be the development of a systematic approach for determining the extent and kind of toxicity information which should be available on a chemical as a function of its position in the development/cycle and its potential uses, including prediction of possible toxic actions from QSAR considerations. A multiple volume hazardous material management guide could be developed. This guide would serve as an important reference for defense contractors, Air Force development and acquisition personnel, and occupational health personnel. An example of a successful reference work for a different application is the Air Force Installation Restoration Program Toxicology Guide. Phase I would involve definition of the concept for use, assessment of the availability of the data required for such as database, and demonstration of QSAR approaches which could be used. Phase II would involve development of an initial database and demonstration of its ability to identify known hazards and suggest potential data gaps on uncharacterized chemicals. The Air Force needs an aid to system designers, manufacturers, and maintainers that will greatly enhance decision-making capability. Such an aid would allow better up-front exploration of system design concepts and help ensure appropriate consideration of the effect of those decisions on downstream activities such as maintenance, logistics, operation, and disposal. As an example, a material (i.e., hydraulic fluid) selected strictly on performance characteristics might produce a prohibitively large environmental impact. The decision to incorporate hazardous materials/devices considerations into the acquisition process in an integrated fashion, such that overall life cycle costs can be managed to acceptable criteria. Phase I research will conclude with a report that clearly defines a recommended approach and specifically addresses the merit and feasibility of that selected approach.

One major concern is the dynamic effects of ultra-short laser pulses on the protective material, the protective properties of the material may decrease, making the material less effective. In other words, the laser pulse may bleach the material, thus lowering its optical density. A need exists for a programmable device which captures the dynamic bleaching effect, in terms of the shape of the laser pulse that caused it, and digitally stores the pulse shape for later analysis. The device should have at least a 5 picosecond risetime and a vertical sensitivity ranging from 50 microvolts to 5 volts. It must have a delay line option to facilitate triggering. The device must have a dynamic range covering the most critical laser wavelengths and must have multi-channel capability.

Development of a methodology (model) which accounts for the relationship and structure between individual and team training for multiship air-to-air combat training. Current approaches to training can be described as development of individual skills for specific procedural tasks at early phases with limited integrated practice of advanced multiship combat tactics at later phases. Restricted training opportunities during advanced training are the result of limited availability of simulators and training aircraft. Recent advanced, low-cost technology may afford the development of complex simulated combat environments which, in some ways, can be instructionally superior to aircraft environments because of the capability to manipulate various dimensions of training, thus overcoming some limitations in current training practice. However, a systematic training methodology is needed as a guideline to take full advantage of advanced technology. Literature on team training reviewed to date appears to offer little guidance for the development of a multiship air combat training model. b. The goal of this effort is to develop and evaluate a team training model for multiship air combat which structures both individual and team training phases according to skill development requirements and other relevant criteria. A central issue is determination of the point (or points) in the program at which individual skills training should transition to multiship team skills training and also how programs should be structured. The research will investigate: (1) skill development hierarchies progressing from individual basic tasks thru group or team multiship combat scenarios; (2) transition from individual skill development to team skills (identification of principles which help determine points within the program at which training should transition from individual to team training methodology); (3) identification, definition, and development of performance criteria and measurement approaches for individual-to-team performance; (4) identification of methodologies which are effective for multiship training; (5) determination of the influence of team membership upon training effectiveness; (6) identification of feedback methods/media which are most effective for individual and team training situations; (7) determination of the influence of task structure and complexity upon the efficiency of team training; and (8) development and evaluation of a training model for air combat multiship training. c. Phase I will be limited to concept formulation, literature review, and definition of research requirements for investigation of issues such as those listed above. Recommendation from the Phase I effort will include additional issues and design requirements for development of the multiship team training model.

To take advantage of this potential, the following research areas are of interest: a. Determine and develop new reliability, availability, and maintainability applications within CAD environments that will aid designers in performing design processes or evaluating design products. Models and/or programs should be compatible with typical design phases of major weapon system acquisition and with ongoing Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability in Computer Aided Design (RAMCAD) integration efforts. b. Determine and develop new applications of decision science methodology that allows design engineers to trade-off various design attributes such as performance, cost, schedule, supportability, and producibility within CAD environments. Attributes may have logical measures of merit which are either qualitative or quantitative in nature, or measures of merit may have to be derived as part of decision support systems. The goal of the decision models is to provide design engineers with capabilities to judge relative merits of various design options and to evaluate final designs with respect to life cycle implications. c. Develop new methodologies and automated tools for information system design and construction which will provide data integration in an increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and distributed environment. Such information systems will support the information requirements of designers as well as other functions throughout a major weapon system‚Äôs life cycle. Current techniques such as IDEF 0 and IDEF 1 have proven to be too manpower and time intensive and lack the semantic richness and developmental framework required for future, large-scale, integrated information systems. d. Determine and develop new ways of presenting information concerning human cognitive and psychomotor performance capabilities within CAD environments. Better ways of portraying large existing knowledge about human abilities developed from basic and applied research are necessary in order to develop decision rules and design criteria for use by design engineers. Meta-analysis, a technique found useful in several behavioral and social science disciplines, could prove beneficial where the knowledge base is known to be diffuse (psychomotor ability) or very dynamic (cognitive psychology).",348,2518,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68459/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68459/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,89.9 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:27:19,,,,,AF89-075_68459,DOD_SBIR_89_P1_C9_AF89-075,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:08.036479+00

Traces showing optical elements, image intensifier, and folding methods around wearer‚Äôs head should be drawn for each optical design approach. b. Investigate feasibility of a fighter attitude indicator which requires less cognitive interpretation, improves aircraft attitude situational awareness, and uses peripheral cueing so as not to interfere with display or environmental view. The mounting may be either on the helmet or in the canopy structure. The indicator must be viewable in a 180 degree horizontal field of view and 90 degree vertical field of view with reference cues to the pilot‚Äôs design eye point.

Phase I: state-of-the-art review, feasibility assessment, and trial application of neural networks to human performance analysis. Phase II: Prototype neural network hardware and software for predicting an important aspect of pilot performance. Demonstrate system capabilities. b. Problem: Manned air defenses modeled using SAINT and artificial intelligence techniques are analysis-intensive and limited to restricted cases. Neural nets may require less analysis, but still maintain fidelity and robustness, allowing modeling of less limited scenarios. Phase I: Choose a neural net architecture or combination of architectures to be used for modeling. Develop methods to train the net. Identify required commercially available or custom software and computer hardware with expected cost, performance, and development schedules. Phase II: Perform proof of concept demonstration. Compare model with current modeling techniques for robustness, handling of novel inputs, and required analysis. Computer hardware and software support is available within the Human Engineering Division. c. To provide on-line physiological assessment of pilot workload and state in aircraft and simulators. On-line monitoring of pilot state is required now and will be essential on newer aircraft and simulator systems. A physiological monitor is required which will provide on-line information and storage of information about pilot‚Äôs heart rate, heart rate variability in two bands, and if possible, eye blink rate and duration information, reliable measures of operator state and workload. The device can be modular but must be capable of being worn by pilots. It should weigh no more than currently available on body recording devices and should be small. Up to eight hours of battery operation and storage capacity are required. All amplification, signal processing, and storage must be accomplished by the device. Phase I: Design and prototype development of the device. Phase II: Fabricate and test the device in actual simulation and aircraft environments. d. Develop and demonstrate non-canonical pictorial formats for optimized cockpit information transfer. Current trends in advanced cockpit displays favor ever-increasing levels of pictorial scene fidelity. Such displays are a Visual Natural Language Interface (VNLI) for presenting the pilot with the necessary geometric relations needed for guidance, navigation, flight control, and general situational awareness. These displays often lack the static and/or dynamic sensitivity available from more conventional presentation formats. The development of an enhanced VNLI providing a synthesis of the natural geometry of the pictorial display with the enhanced sensitivity and precision of the non-pictorial format is needed. The synthesis should be accomplished via an appropriate transformation of the canonical pictorial format, and not via a simple overlay of pictorial and conventional formats. The Phase I effort will evaluate feasibility via four tasks: 1) selection of a candidate flight task and identification of associated display requirements; 2) development of one or more candidate non-canonical pictorial displays; 3) evaluation of task performance and pilot workload, via real-time pilot-in-the-loop simulation; 4) evaluation of overall feasibility and recommendation for further development.

Objective measures exist on such factors as speed and ability to deliver a weapon payload and costs of development, manufacturing and operation can be estimated and weighed against the system‚Äôs performance. However, in the conduct and delivery of human centered research and research products, defining and measuring the benefits are much more difficult tasks. Often benefits are expressed in such terms as improved training, better job performance, or increased job satisfaction. When they are quantified, the benefits, at best, are expressed in terms of reduced costs in such areas as recruiting, training, and sustaining, or retaining the force. Very seldom is the manpower, personnel, and training research community able to make strong, positive, supportable statements about the value of its research products. The Human Systems Division is constantly faced with decisions about the proper mix of diverse research efforts including selection and classification, job restructuring and determination, decision aids and models, life support systems, toxic material evaluation, etc. These decisions allocating limited R&D resources among competing projects are greatly complicated by the inability to measure potential benefits in a manner that is equally meaningful to the different types of R&D programs. This research would be divided into two distinct phases. Phase I of this project would review the current status of cost/benefit analysis and assessment of utility/worth, concentrating on R&D project selection and benefit determination. The intent of Phase I will be to develop a model which will permit the estimation of benefits from manpower, personnel, and training R&D (areas in which it has traditionally been difficult to determine dollar values) and facilitate the comparison of such efforts with hardware-oriented R&D/engineering efforts. Relevant research and cost/benefit models from the private sector as well as other government and military studies will be reviewed. Data definitions, data availability, and alternative measures (dollars, time, etc.), use of the model in allocating resources, and other factors will be considered in this phase.

Current AI types of systems are implemented as rule-based systems where facts are asserted into the knowledgebase by a portion of the system called the inference engine. This inference mechanism controls the manner in which knowledge-based systems accomplish there given task. To achieve ""real-time‚Äù operation of these types of systems, this normally serial process needs to be parallelized. There are several classes of parallel processors in existence today; and as part of this effort, a trade study will be done to determine each processor‚Äôs adaptability to real-time knowledge-based systems. This study will also determine which class of parallel processors will give the greatest gains in speed and performance and then determine the ability to adapt an inference engine to that processors available under DARPA‚Äôs Strategic Computing Program and determine the adaptability of each for implementing complex AI applications for avionics with the potential of achieving real-time operations. While several inference engines are based upon the Rete algorithm, there are modifications to this algorithm which attempt to improve the inherent serial nature of the algorithm. Also, part of this Phase I activity should be the familiarization of algorithms used for inferencing. This should lead to Phase II activities of modifying and implementing an inferencing mechanism for a parallel processor identified in Phase I. Phase II should target an existing airborne application to show potential real-time operation as a result of this effort. b. Currently, there exists a variety of algorithms dealing with the generation of graphics primitives. For example, Bresenham‚Äôs and Digital Differential Analyzer algorithms are principally used for generating ""lines‚Äù and ""circles‚Äù. The program will investigate the adaptability of these algorithms to parallel processing architectures. Algorithms will be investigated for each primitive as defined in the evolving PHIGS graphics standard. Phase I should examine these algorithms and determine which ones lend themselves, as is, to parallelism, which ones can be modified or if new algorithms need to be written. The primary metric to be used in evaluating the potential for each candidate algorithm is speed. Each algorithm will be investigated from the standpoint of its current execution speed to that which can be achieved using parallel processing techniques currently under development. If the algorithms can be modeled and executed in a parallel fashion, they will provide the software framework for use in a subsequent effort investigating the hardware requirements needed to generate complex graphics images in real-time. Phase II will consist of mapping these algorithms onto an existing parallel processor. This will demonstrate the potential of parallel processing for real-time graphics generation.",430,2903,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68468/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68468/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,89.9 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:27:22,,,,,AF89-082_68468,DOD_SBIR_89_P1_C9_AF89-082,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:08.036479+00

The increased complexity and operational and maintenance requirements of advanced weapon systems make it unlikely that the required diagnostic capability will be achieved through conventional BIT methods. To diagnose future avionics systems and reduce built-in test equipment (BITE) necessitates a capability to reason about faults at a system level in much the same manner as pilots or maintenance technicians perform diagnostics. Humans are able to cope with many of the deficiencies of current BIT systems through their ability to reason effectively about the intended design behavior of the system given system-level information that is often uncertain (unreliable, incomplete, and/or contradictory). Abductive and inductive reasoning provide the means to deal with the uncertainty and combinatorial problems, associated with performing diagnostics from system-level information and provide techniques to reason at a much ""deeper‚Äù level than can be accomplished using current production rule or model-based systems. Phase I should include a study of the diagnostic problems anticipated for advanced avionics systems, the limitations of conventional BIT and artificial intelligence approaches, and the applicability of abductive and inductive reasoning to diagnosis of advanced avionics systems. The study should also include an investigation of the relationship between abductive reasoning and reasoning from first principles. In addition, a feasibility demonstration should be performed illustrating the capability to synthesize inductively abductive models to perform diagnostics at a system level given uncertain information. Phase II should result in a prototype system and demonstration that conclusively illustrate the capability to increase fault detection and isolation, validate failure indications, and substantially reduce BITE requirements for advanced avionics using a combination of abduction and induction. Phase II should also result in the design and prototyping of a generic system for diagnosing advanced avionics systems.",345,2463,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68469/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/68469/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,89.9 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:27:22,,,,,AF89-083_68469,DOD_SBIR_89_P1_C9_AF89-083,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:08.036479+00

The difficulty of these tasks increases exponentially as a function of both system complexity and threat diversity. While considerable advances have been made in the development of digital models and hybrid simulators, the uniqueness and point design nature of these tools in their present state precludes the transition of information and/or interconnection of complementary features. Since commonality between digital models and hybrid simulators is high and, in general differs only in level fidelity, methods to connect or transition information between complementary functions of the digital models and hybrid simulators would yield high payoff for both the analyst and test engineer. Examples include correlation between study results and test and evaluation data, standardization of threat and EC system parameters, and verification of digital model accuracy.

The primary purpose of this program is to enhance the understanding of tribological phenomenon of surface interactions and behavior of the thin lubricating films. One are related to these studies which requires investigation and greater understanding is the role of stresses within the thin coatings. Under extreme operating environments, favorable friction and wear behavior between two interacting solids is often achieved by applying one or more coatings of suitable materials to the mating surfaces. Since bulk properties of coating materials are generally quite different in comparison to those of the substrate, the design of a substrate-coating system is dependent on realistic modeling of stresses in the coatings as a function of the prescribed operating conditions. For a prescribed temperature field and boundary loading on the surface, analytical models to predict the following are currently needed: Stress distribution in coatings; stresses at the interfaces between the coatings and between coating substrate; thermal stresses introduced by the difference in thermal coefficient of expansion of the coating and substrate materials; adhesive and ""break away‚Äù stresses between the coating and substrate; fatigue or endurance limits of the coatings when cyclic stress are imposed on the surface. Aside from design of coated solids, in forms of coating thickness and application techniques, the predictive strengths of the models will play a vital role in materials selection and screening. Thus, in addition to the design of current applications, these models should offer substantial guidance for materials development for advanced systems application in the future.

Phase I activity will include demonstration of feasibility through melting studies involving the composites and adhesives of interest and candidate surface modification treatment for the composites.

Worse, most automated systems require detailed specifications as to the preconditions and results of actions. These restrictions are clearly intolerable in a management or manufacturing enterprise where one is dealing with the thousands of employees, each with their own epistemic states, and with thousands of potential actions that may be performed concurrently or in an overlapped manner. Consider the following three actions: A manager orders and employee to make a part; the employee makes the part and then reports to the manager that the part is made. Initially, the manager‚Äôs goal is to make the part. After the order is given this goal becomes the employee‚Äôs goal and the manager has the expectation that the part will be made. After the employee makes the part, the employee has the belief that the part was made, and when this belief is reported to the manager it becomes the manager‚Äôs belief. Unfortunately, these fairly obvious descriptions of the consequences of these actions do no explain a number of subtleties; such as why the manager should continue to expect that the part is being made during and after the period in which it was made, as this was not explicitly stated as a result of making that part, and also as to why the manager no longer has the goal of making the part once the expectation that the part will be made is acquired. The first subtlety is known as the frame problem in plan formation and the second involves the use of general constraints defining allowable situations. What is needed are general mechanisms and laws for propagating facts from one situation to another as actions are performed. This would involve both forward planning systems to predict new epistemic states as actions are performed and also allow for concurrent sequences of actions to be found which satisfy specific goals, expectations, and beliefs. It would also involve planning systems for dealing with histories of events, where certain facts are known and one is being asked to reconstruct a plausible explanation of what happened. It is expected that these systems should involve generic solutions to these problems rather that the hand coding of each situation/action/fact as is done in most current systems which use lists which are coded separately for each action. A general theory should be given for specifying the propagation of arbitrary sentences of first order quantificational logic supplemented with a wide variety of epistemic, model, and intentional concepts involving defaults.

Advanced engine test cell evaluation programs are limited by the problems associated with current structural instrumentation capabilities. The state of the art of structural instrumentation has many shortcomings in both the strain gage and thermocouple areas. Current turbine engine demonstration tests are particularly impaired by the fact that present instrumentation is commonly temperature limited, shortlived, inaccurate, and either protrudes into the gas flow stream or requires trenching the structural component in order to embed the sensor. For these reasons, new sensors/systems capable of surviving the harsh environment of advanced turbine engine tests while providing accurate strain and/or metal temperature data are required. Candidate sensors/systems should be capable of withstanding the temperatures and strains typical of turbine engine tests for extended periods while detecting strain to within plus or minus 5 percent and temperature to within plus or minus 1 percent.

Because they are extremely toxic compounds, categorized as suspected human carcinogens, the propellant handlers must be protected from exposures to hazardous levels The threshold limit values (TLVs) of the three amine fuels, N2H4 (hydrazine), MMH (Monomethylhydrazine), and UDMH (Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine), are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 ppm (parts per million), respectively.

The response shall be readily observable in real time such as an obvious change in color without having to wait for analysis results obtained in a laboratory at a later time. An incorporation of an audio alarm system would be highly desirable. It shall be lightweight and compact (shirt pocket size) and exhibit interface free behavior that will not yield false positive response in the presence of other contaminant gases.

Millimeter wave beam scanning offers the advantage of narrow beam communications in space with small antennas. Current millimeter wave electronic beam switches are based on phased array concepts with millimeter wave phase shifters using either ferrite devices or semiconductor devices.

One of the primary technical issues for future space power systems will be to achieve significant reductions in system mass. Power systems also need to be hardened against anticipated hostile threats while still providing reliable long life operation. The Air Force is interested in developing lightweight survivable space power and thermal management components. Areas of particular interest are: 1) solar photovoltaic arrays, 2) large solar concentrators, 3) dynamic power cycles, 4) high efficiency thermal storage systems, 5) lightweight direct contact heat exchangers, 6) advanced radiators, and 7) thermal management fluid control. For solar photovoltaic arrays, the primary technical issue is to minimize or eliminate power losses due to environmental interactions and hostile threats. Innovative uses of materials, geometries and other survivability enhancing techniques should be used. Design parameters: array power of 10 to 100 Kwe with array specific power greater than 25 W/kg. For large solar concentrators advanced concepts that are easily deployable and able to stay on orbit for years with minimal losses of concentration efficiency is the technical challenge. Design parameters: equivalent solar dynamic power of 100 to 1000 KWe with concentrator mass of less than 2 kg/m2. For dynamic power cycles, identifying innovative alternatives to the conventional power cycles (Sterling, Brayton, and Rankine) is the technical challenge. Power cycles and working fluids should be specifically optimized for operation in the space environment. Design parameters: power of 10-100 KW with cycle specific power of greater than 25 W/kg. The primary technical challenges for the practical application of thermal storage concepts are: high equivalent specific heat capacity, temperature matching, effective thermal conduction into and out of the thermal storage material, and long term stability in the space environment. For lightweight direct contact heat exchangers, a key technical issue is high separation efficiency of the heat exchange media in a microgravity environment while minimizing heat exchanger mass. Applications of these heat exchangers to the Brayton and Rankine power cycles are of the greatest interest. For advanced radiators concepts, specific masses should be less than 1.0 kg/kw at a 300 deg K radiating temperature, and/or 0.2 kg/KW in the 500 deg K temperature range while maximizing survivability. In any active thermal management subsystem, there exists the requirement for fluid flow management at minimum weight, long service life, and high reliability. An offeror may submit more than one proposal in response to this topic, but each proposal should cover only one area of interest. For each effort, Phase I should produce a complete analysis of the concept‚Äôs feasibility, a prediction of performance characteristics, and a design of a proof of principle model. Technical issues such as high efficiency, lightweight, long life, and high reliability are of prime interest.

To date, there is little understanding of the effects of these flaws on the thermomechanical properties and strength of Carbon-Carbon Materials. The development of imperfection acceptance criteria for C-C materials is of prime importance to the successful utilization of these materials in space structures.

Material models will be developed which will allow evaluation of the effects of various types and sizes of imperfections upon the thermal and mechanical properties and strengths of C-C composite structural elements. In the Phase II of the program the application of these models to generate quantitative information to allow the development of acceptance criteria should be addressed.

A dynamic CT system would provide actual experimental data in place of postulated model data. If dynamic CT ability is achieved, the solid propulsion designers, scientists, and engineers will have a tool that can provide information about localized grain burn rates around the motor within slot and fin cavities, and the capability to study anomalous burning and charring in a solid rocket motor.

It‚Äôs high energy output per unit mass makes hydrogen not only a desirable alternative energy source in an internal combustion engine to power motor vehicles, but an ideal fuel for space applications and rocket propulsion where a high energy density is particularly important. Such a use relates to Project Forecast II‚Äôs High Energy Density Matter effort. One to the problems with hydrogen‚Äôs wide spread use as an energy source is the difficulty associated with storage. Container weight and safety considerations are problems with gas storage and large amounts of energy are consumed in the liquidfaction process if the hydrogen is stored as the liquid. The use of metal hydrides may provide a safe and effective storage medium. The hydride formation is reversible, produces a stable product, and a unit volume of the metal hydride can hold more hydrogen than gaseous or liquid hydrogen. A metal hydrogen storage system would be appealing for space applications in two ways. First, a stable method of hydrogen storage would eliminate problems associated with cryogenic storage, such as tank leakage and required weight/volume ratio of tanks. Secondly, the metal hydride storage system itself could be used as an energetic fuel for propulsion or power generation. The research to be performed is in this area of hydrogen storage using metal hydrides. Innovations need to be developed to improve the kinetics of hydrogen uptake/release, determine how to prepare the metal for maximum hydrogen loading, and examine which metals or alloys are most suitable for the stated application (e.g. have energy densities by weight and volume that surpass the current iron-titanium hydride). Success will be measured by comparison to existing space storage systems. Phase I would examine the potential for such storage schemes and would include the evaluation of several different metals as a storage medium.

Traces of monomer and dimmers that form in the initial production of the binders are thought to be the cause of some of the problems. Most binders are cured with an isocyanate curative, hence, water can interfere with the cure reaction and can also cause the cast rocket motor to fail.

The expected military consequences of these emissions include degradation of optical and infrared surveillance sensors by local background emissions and failure to discriminate targets against a structured infrared atmospheric background, as well as the betrayal of space assets to hostile forces. New cameras for direct imaging and analysis of these infrared signatures can be based on recent technological advances, with platinum silicide or other materials, that have produced infrared detectors characterized by high sensitivity, low noise, and large high-density linear and mosaic arrays. This abstract has two separate tasks, which can be responded to either separately or jointly. Task A: Space-Qualified Camera for Optical Emissions in Space. Cameras that employ large-array detectors can have high sensitivity because they are staring instruments; that is, the whole image is recorded at once rather than over an interval during which the object is scanned. Prototypes have been very successful, and the advantages of this technology should now be extended for use in space. The objective of this task is to design and build a camera for a series of space experiments aboard the space shuttle and shuttle-borne spacecraft. It should be adaptable to almost any flight opportunity by designing for compatibility with typical shuttle and spacecraft support platforms. The Phase I product is to be a preliminary design. It will start with existing detector technologies, laboratory model, and flight-feasibility study; include an assessment of the sensitivity required to match the expected brightness of emissions to be studied; progress to selecting and optimizing detector material and type, maintaining the detector cryogenic temperature, handling the large volume of digital images, and assuring space-qualified mechanical and optical designs; and result in meeting the requirements of a typical spacecraft preliminary design review. Phase II will produce the final design and construction of a prototype flight instrument, for which the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory will seek an actual flight opportunity in which it will be used to study spacecraft environmental interactions. Task B: Ground-Based Camera for Atmospheric Emissions. This task proposes the design of a sensitive high-resolution infrared camera for the direct measurement of atmospheric emissions in observational programs using both ground and aircraft-based sensors. The camera is to observe auroral and airglow emissions in the wavelength region extending from approximately one to six microns. The Phase I product is to be a feasibility study of different experimental approaches and the presentation of a proposed camera design. Design consideration should be given to providing high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, subsecond temporal resolution with a time-averaging capability for weak emissions, flexibility in the observation of a series of different wavelengths, radiometric precision, and a wide dynamic range. Particular emphasis should be given to approaching the theoretical limits of measurement capability in signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolving power.

(Path-of-travel is the track made upon any intervening plane, e.g. a cloud layer, by the unbroken interaction for some time period between two systems layer, by the unbroken interaction for some time period between two systems moving relative to one another). Attempts have been made to quantify the probability of these cloud-free conditions during such interactions based upon cloud observations made at surface locations or, to a lesser extent, from aircraft. The input to such techniques is invariably a surface-based estimate of sky-cover. These assessment schemes are suspected of being site-specific and are known to deal poorly with the situation of interaction from orbit to within-atmosphere, or vice versa. Since the advent of environmental satellites more than 25 years ago, the possibility of quantifying cloud-free conditions from orbit has, to some extent, existed but the technical challenge is still the exploitation of that possibility. The compelling reasons for utilizing satellite data for this purpose are: (1) the close comparative nature of environmental orbital sensors to orbital surveillance systems, (2) the global scope of coverage offered only by satellite platforms, (3) the high refresh-rate afforded by orbital remote sensors, (4) the nearly equal ability for making cloud-free assessments during day or night. The satellite is the only alternative data source in areas where conventional meteorological information is nonexistent or can be denied. At present no technique for assessing cloud-free conditions based solely on satellite data exists. During Phase I, a detailed specification will be made of what can be determined in regard to cloud-free assessment using present (and planned) satellite measurement systems. Considered must be domestic (both civilian and military) and foreign (e.g. SPOT) satellite imagers. The topics of sensors resolution, cloud/no-cloud discrimination, multi-channel detection and off-nadir data correction must be addressed. In addition, prototype assessments of cloud-free conditions using examples of satellite images containing varying amounts and types of clouds (total number of such images, at least 30) taken from at least 4 different satellite platforms will be accomplished during Phase I. The main thrust of the Phase II effort will be the quantitative inter-comparison of satellite cloud-free specifications with similar assessments accomplished from the Earth‚Äôs surface using digital whole-sky cloud images will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE). The other major Phase II task will be the development of optimal techniques for specifying (analytically or in probability terms) cloud-free lines-of-sight and paths-of-travel under various cloud conditions using satellite data only.",439,3055,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67210/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67210/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,89.9 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:28:04,,,,,AF89-197_67210,DOD_SBIR_89_P1_C9_AF89-197,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:09.068699+00

One requirement that many of these proposed operational systems share is the need for real-time data processing. The Doppler shifted backscatter signal contains information about the winds, turbulence, and aerosol content of the scattering volume, but these parameters must be estimated by time consuming spectral analysis. Conventional computer architectures are simply not well suited for performing these computations in real-time for most Doppler lidar applications. Furthermore, wide signal dynamic range, typically up to 80 decibels, presents problems for many off the shelf processors. The purpose of this contractual effort will be to apply new advances in signal processing technology to the design and construction of a high-speed programmable signal processor for a CO2 Doppler lidar system (outlined below). Such a processor will have application in numerous ground and space-based Doppler lidar applications. This processor must be programmable to allow for the development of new data reduction algorithms and must be capable of computing estimates of mean wind speed, turbulence, and backscattered power. These computations must be done in real-time for the following ground-based lidar system: Laser Transmitter: Pulsed CO2 TEA laser Laser Wavelength: 10.6 microns Pulse Width: 1 microsecond Pulse Repetition Frequency: up to 100 pulses per second Receiver: Heterodyne, 40 MHz offset Maximum Measurement Range: 30 Kilometers Doppler Wind Bandwidth: 20 MHz (-50 to +50 meters/sec) Inputs to the proper Doppler processor will be the in-phase and quadrature (I and Q) components of the received backscatter signal. These signals will be centered at baseband and have a half bandwidth of 10 MHz. Output of the processor will be digital data passed to a VAX Unibus computer via a parallel direct memory access (DMA) interface. Phase I should result in a complete processor design, which is viable, will be built and tested under Phase II. Final testing will be performed with the processor connected to the working lidar outlined above. While this processor will be used for a specific ground-based application, some attention should be given to how the results of this effort could apply to other lidar applications, such as space-based lidar wind sensing.",364,2403,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67211/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67211/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,89.9 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:28:05,,,,,AF89-198_67211,DOD_SBIR_89_P1_C9_AF89-198,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:09.068699+00

This abstract has two separate tasks, which can be responded to either separately or jointly. Task A: Solar Telescope Application. The forecasting of solar activity and its impact on space weather and DoD systems and operations relies on the observation of solar spectral lines which are used to deduce spatial and temporal distributions or temperature, pressure, velocity, and magnetic fields and their relationship to solar activity. By introducing computer controlled operation of a suitable optical filter system, it should be possible to achieve very rapid spectral tuning across not only one but several spectral lines in sequence. If the lines selected are formed at different heights in the solar atmosphere, information concerning the physical properties of the atmosphere across a three-dimensional grid could be obtained. While optical filters yielding high quality two-dimensional images for computer-controlled rapid scanning across one or more spectral lines represents a challenge to current technology, the solution to which would be of considerable value to many electro-optical projects and laboratories. Phase I would explore the problem of rapid computer-controlled scanning across a single spectral line and the development of a prototype system. Provided Phase I is successful, Phase II would concern the development of a prototype system capable of scanning across several spectral lines and its replication for installation at a number of ground-based solar observatories. Task B: Daylight Lidar Application. Air Force Lidars are used to measure neutral density and meteoric atomic species in the middle atmosphere (30-100 km altitudes). However, the strong radiance of the daylight sky contributes to the background noise of the optical signal and typically limits Lidar to a night-only operation. To block out this background radiation a novel filter with a narrow bandwidth is required. Requirements for the optical filter are as follows: a characteristic response time smaller than 100 ns; a bandwidth equal to or less than 0.001 nm; and a quantum efficiency greater than 10%. The filter must be designed an packaged so that it can be coupled to a signal-limited detector (e.g. cooled photomultiplier) with a high combined efficiency. Noise power from the filter has to be negligible or comparable to detector noise. It must operate on one of the wavelengths of interest to Rayleigh Lidar: second harmonic of Nd:YAG or XeF excimer; or resonance Lidar: NaD2, Ca(II) 393 nm, or Fe(I) 372 nm. In Phase I, filter concept and a careful design of the filter-to-detector coupling will be developed. In Phase II, the offeror will optimize efficiencies, fabricate and test the filter/detector. Testing the prototype with an operating Lidar will be required.",442,2889,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67212/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/67212/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,89.9 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:28:05,,,,,AF89-199_67212,DOD_SBIR_89_P1_C9_AF89-199,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:09.068699+00

Accurate characterization of the various free field electromagnetic quantities is a key prerequisite to interpretation of these effects tests. Parameters of interest include radiated power density, frequency spectrum of the radiated envelope, envelope shape, and antenna pattern. Because HPM testing is presently carried out by a wide variety of personnel and organizations in both controlled laboratory environments as well as poorly controlled field environments, there is little standardization in measurement techniques. The problem is especially severe in open air field tests because time and space limitations often prevent a full complement of diagnostics from being utilized. A need exists for a fully automated compact, self-contained HPM data acquisition system which will operate under the direction of a personal computer to rapidly acquire, reduce, and achieve data in a harsh field environment. Because next generation HPM sources will repetitively pulse at multi-Hz rates, novel, innovative diagnostic recording, analysis, and storage techniques will be required to interpret the rapid stream of digital data. Because rapid setup and ease of transportation is key criterion, the HPM diagnostic sensors themselves should be few in number, physically robust, and adequately broadband to characterize electromagnetic environments from sub-GHz to x-band frequencies. Phase I work will involve innovative design of a set of broadband, physically robust microwave sensors, definition of novel PC-based data reduction and archival algorithms, and selection of appropriate signal capture instrumentation.

If the microwave energy produced from such a source in a period of tens of microseconds can be stored, and then released in a timescale of a microsecond or shorter, then potentially short pulses of gigawatt level microwave power can be produced. To date, such high power levels have only been achieved in relatively low efficiency cold-cathode field emission devices, such as the virtual cathode oscillator. Advanced concepts related to the creation of high efficiency, high-energy storage, gigawatt output power pulse compression cavities are needed. Consideration should be given to novel and innovative solutions to the relevant physics and engineering aspects of the overall source/pulse compression cavity/antenna system. These include optimizing physical shape of the storage cavity, materials selections, and method of switching of the RF energy to the output waveguide. The newly developed class of superconducting materials which operates at liquid nitrogen temperatures offers potentially substantial increases in energy storage time and overall efficiency.

Primary mirrors may be relatively small, lightweight and easy to fabricate and test. The system may be launched either folded up or in pieces, but with individual subtelescopes fully assembled and aligned. The whole system may then be assembled or unfolded with automatic alignment systems doing the critical adjustments. The phased array telescope must be designed so that the subtelescope positions with respect to each other are not critical. A servo system then adjusts the smaller beam combining optics to superimpose and phase the multiple images to give the resolution of a single very large telescope. This is a relatively simple problem for narrow field of view telescopes used for astronomy or for laser beam projection, but has never been done for a wide field of view. The key problem is to superimpose and phase the images from each of the subtelescopes at the focal plane where a video sensor or a piece of photographic film resides. Doing this over the entire field of view simultaneously requires that telescope aberrations such as field curvature and distortion be reduced to levels never before required of an optical system. Heretofore, insignificant variations in the magnification of the telescopes or in the thickness of refractive elements can prevent the telescope from working properly. Alignment requirements among the subtelescopes can also become prohibitively tight. The Air Force is interested in phased array telescope designs with the potential to be built with effective aperture sizes of ten meters or larger with a 30 arcminute or greater fields of view. The telescopes must give essentially diffraction-limited performance from visible through mid-infrared wavelengths.

Transverse injection of one of the reactants into the primary flows can enhance mixing but may not improve the chemical reaction. Two-phase flows often involve a reaction between a gas and either solid particles or liquid droplets. Decreasing the droplet or particle size increases the effective surface area for reactions to occur, but the increased number of particles and closer distribution can have a dramatic effect on the surrounding neighbors and the gas concentration. Also, smaller drops may get depleted, which may or may not be desirable depending on design consideration. When injected transverse to the primary flow, smaller particles or droplets will have less momentum than larger particles or droplets for a given initial velocity and may get swept along with the free stream before reacting entirely or collecting on an opposite boundary. A design tool is needed to address the various parameters that effect the mixing processes and single and two-phase flows. Tractable methods must be found to model these effects and explore their chemical efficiency.

In order to accurately implement the beam the precise direction of propagation must be known. Demonstrator systems can implement several techniques for beam sensing due to the lower duty factor, current, and energy. Laser resonance fluorescence (LRF) and Doppler shift sensing techniques, which are non-intrusive and rely upon the presence of excited state populations in hydrogen to be present, are the current candidates for the higher level systems. There are concerns regarding the predicted low level signal to noise ratios for these techniques which could cause the methods to fail. Calculations have been performed to determine the excited state populations expected following a foil neutralizer; however, the assumptions which have to be made for the calculations are significant. The excitation of the neutral hydrogen occurs through the collisional stripping in the foil neutralizer. There is a need to adequately evaluate the beam sensing techniques as applied to actual systems; therefore, a measurement of pertinent excited states should be made to provide a sound technical basis for determining viable beam sensing techniques. In Phase I, the technique for the absolute measurement of several excited state populations in an existing neutral particle beam system (such as an ANL or BNL) will be designed. The design of the technique should be made as to be germane to the proposed designs for beam sensing, especially in the distance from the neutralizer to the point of measurement. In Phase II, the result from Phase I should be expanded to include demonstration of the technique and measurements on a range energies of the NPBs in order to determine scaling to an actual weapons grade system.

These laser illuminators may use different wavelengths and the illuminated spot size will vary as a function of laser design and range to target. Air Force assets as surface to air missile sites, mobile air traffic control facilities, and armored vehicles will be some of the targets that an opponent will want to destroy. To improve survivability of these assets, it is proposed that innovative ideas be investigated that can passively absorb incident laser light such that there is no reflected light (laser spot is not visible to incoming smart munitions) and/or active systems that passively detect the incident radiation and, through a response action, dispense an aerosol (or other mechanism) that scatters the incident laser beam such that smart munitions can not home in on a reflected laser spot. Some of the challenges to this problem are: (a) any passive material for absorbing incident laser radiation should not enhance the ability for detection in another portion of the electromagnetic spectrum; (b) a system that uses passive sensors to detect incident laser radiation must be able to discriminate laser light from sunlight/head-lights and be in sufficient numbers to detect any illuminating laser spot (laser spot incident on target); (c) an active system that dispenses an aerosol must take into consideration vehicle velocity, wind direction, that military personnel may be near the mechanism that dispenses the aerosol when this machine is placed in action; and (d) any innovative approach taken must not interfere with the operational function of the asset it is to protect.

The electrical charging of motor cases and propellant fin-forming hardware to several tens of kilovolts poses a serious safety risk. A subsequent potential impulsive electrical discharge could ultimately lead to propellant ignition. The channeling of electrostatic discharge energy into propellant combustion modes involves several steps. The most probable series of channels involve charge build-up, discharge, heat generation, propellant evaporation, ignition and final steady combustion. It is desired to develop safe casting methods which minimize electrostatic charge build-up on tools which would reduce the risk of accidental propellant ignition through ESD mechanism.

The primary function is to prevent the case from reaching temperatures that endanger its structural integrity. The insulation material contains filler or reinforcement embedded in elastomeric binder. When the insulation is exposed to the booster environment consisting of high radiative heat flux, impinging propellant gas and particle and shear flow, the ablation of insulation will occur. As the exposure continues, surface char material will be progressively eroded. Thus, a proper insulation design requires knowledge of the booster environment, the ablative characteristics of the insulation, and furthermore, a demonstrated reliability level desirable in rocket boosters. The conventional approaches to choose insulation material and size the thickness relied either on the successful experience in previous booster programs or entirely on the full-scale booster firings to generate reliable data. The first approach has the benefits of cost saving but provides little improvement in current plate of the insulation technology. The second approach requires a costly and time-consuming developmental program. If the application of the state-of-the-art materials technology and cost reduction in insulation development are desired, scale testing (6 inch lite motor) and the bench-scale testing, such as plasma-arc and oxyacetylene torch test are performed. However, correlations to relate ablation rate from these test data to full-scale booster firing data are often erroneous. The primary drawback of these testings is that they are too crude to simulate the actual booster environment.

For example, the erosion rate of the forward dome internal insulation of Peacekeeper motors have been known to be much higher for flight tests than that of static tests. The cause of this enhanced erosion phenomenon is the additional mechanical loading, such as shock vibration, tension and compression acting on the char layer induced by the vehicle acceleration loads. Once the char layer is removed by the acceleration loads, the underlining virgin material is exposed to intense heat flux which then leads to enhanced insulation erosion. To understand insulation performance under vehicle acceleration is important because insulation burn-through can lead to catastrophic flight failure. The need to characterize effect of acceleration on insulation performance is more important for future solid rocket motors, since future motor will subject to high acceleration field (e.g. fastburn booster). Phase I of this effort will develop analytical models to predict insulation performance under various vehicle acceleration levels. Additionally, standard laboratory methods will be developed to thoroughly characterize insulation with respect to physical, mechanical, and thermal properties, e.g. surface morphology, decomposition profile, density, and porosity.

The theoretical benefits are substantial; by depressing the molecular weight of the combustion products, the hydrogen (which does not burn or contribute any energy) can theoretically produce increases in specific impulse of ten percent or more. In recent tests at the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory, hydrogen injection was shown to cause a six percent gain in Isp in a motor firing at sea level. In addition, to raising performance, hydrogen injection would allow throttling of the solid motor over a certain range, and impulse management to deliver a very precise total impulse to an airborne vehicle. Applications of this technique to ballistic missiles would have several benefits, such as reduced demand on post boost propulsion systems through more precise control of solid booster burnout velocity, range enhancement through higher delivered specific impulse, lower solid sliver through a slowdown of chamber pressure drop during tailoff, and possible elimination of staging side force problems by using injectant expansion to produce thrust at low levels for the staging event. The technical challenge is to find a storable injectant, be it hydrogen or something else. Cryogenic liquids are out of the question for typical ballistic missile applications, and the use of high-pressure gaseous hydrogen, while it cannot be ruled out, entails significant storage and safety problems. A storable liquid or high-density gas which would evolve a significant amount of hydrogen, yet not absorb so much energy upon disassociation as to lower performance, is desired.

The problem is providing protection for attitude control thrusters during the boost phase, and them removing the protection so that the thrusters can fire to maneuver the PBV. To date, the approach has been to place some sort of protective door over the nozzle exit plane, and rely on the first ACS firing to remove it. Thus, the door‚Äôs fastening system must be weak enough to fail under the relatively small force provided by the ACS thruster. At the same time, however, the fastening system must be robust enough to keep the door on in the specified nuclear blast environments, not to mention during the dynamic load environments of transportation, basing, nuclear ground shock and boost. The worst of the nuclear effects is pebble impact, where a pebble of a certain size strikes the door at a certain velocity and angle without causing the door to be removed. The design task is therefore on of meeting contradictory requirements, a fact which is never fully appreciated until the first test is conducted. A standard solution to this problem is required, and it may take any form as long as it is applicable to any type of attitude control engine (i.e., nonpropellant, solid or bipropellant at any pulsewidth or thrust level). The standard door design should account for a combination of worst case loads from ICBM programs, such as HML vibration from SICBM, silo flyout acoustics from Minuteman, pebble impact from Peacekeeper or SICBM, etc.; it should then be applicable to virtually any future programs.

Individual LWIR detector elements with adequate detectivity and radiometric accuracy require exotic materials and demanding fabrication techniques. Mosaics or arrays of such elements therefore tend to be very costly. Whenever the sensor is located within the atmosphere, it must be mounted behind a suitable window or in a windowless cavity. Both options are expensive. The former, because windows with high optical quality and LWIR tranmissivity, like detectors, require special materials and techniques.

Measurement of Chemistry in RV Boundary Layers: Develop methods for making measurements of chemical interactions in shock and boundary layers of sub-scale reentry vehicle models used in a ballistic range. These sub-scale models have thin boundary layers which typically are on the order of 0.1cm thick. The specific chemical interactions and the location in the boundary layer or shock layer on the model must be identified. The presence and effect of ablation products in the boundary layer on chemical interactions should be included. b. Measurement of Transition of Ballistic Range Models: Develop new methods to measure the occurrence of transition to turbulent flow on sub-scale conical models used in ballistic ranges. Methods other than Schlieren photography are sought to determine when and where on the model transition occurs. The influence of both thrusted and unthrusted wakes should be considered in the effort. c. Aerodynamic Coefficients for High Performance Lifting RV: Perform tests obtaining aerodynamic coefficients that are applicable for high performance lifting reentry vehicles. The proposed project would define/develop a class of optimum Maneuvering Reentry Vehicle (MaRV) configurations of fixed geometry for glider and evader missions and to develop classes of variable geometry configurations for highly maneuverable RVs which enhance efficiency of converting kinetic energy to maneuver impulse by providing high (L/D) 3.5 over a wide range of Mach number and angle-of-attack that is possible with any fixed configurations. It is likely that fairly sophisticated CFD techniques will be needed to guide the facility selection and test matrix development. d. Low Mach Number Aerodynamics: Algorithms are sought to estimate reentry vehicle aerodynamics at high Reynolds number (turbulent) and low Mach number flows (0.7 < M < 3.5). Methods for predicting the advent of the transonic angle-to-attack divergence and designs to avoid this dynamic instability phenomena are particularly of interest. In addition to engineering correlation, three dimensional inviscid (Euler) flow and Navier-Stokes models may be required. These methodologies should address the maneuvering reentry vehicle yaw stability and base drag. The offeror should be familiar with the state-of-the-art technologies. e. Hypersonic Three Dimensional Rarefied Flows Analysis: Techniques are sought to estimate the rarefied 3D flow fields around an ascending missile or RV. Emphasis is placed on the calculation of thermal and chemical non-equilibrium phenomena. Development of 3D Monte Carlo Direct Simulation (MCDS) approach is one approach which is ideal for the transitional flow. New concepts and formulations are sought to make MCDS faster and practical in engineering applications. Body configuration of interest is the blunt multi-conic body and the major parameters of interest are the force/moments, local heat transfer and the detailed flow properties. Flow regimes range from 10-3<kn<10 (where Kn equals the Knudsen number).

The body surface can be conducting, with dielectric layer or surface impedance. Specifically computer codes are sought for estimating the effects of: (a) antenna window; (b) plasma sheathing; and (c) 3D configuration effects. b. Body/Wake Optical Signature. Simple and accurate methods are sought to estimate the bode/wake/plume optical signature of a reentry vehicle (RV) particularly in the near IR, visible and ultraviolet regimes. Improvements and upgrades on the state-of-the-art technologies (e.g., the optical signature code, standard infrared model, etc.) in the areas of robustness, versatility, computer speed, propellant variations and accuracy of data input are particularly encouraged. The offerors should be familiar with the industry-standard methodologies and review the limitation and weakness of those formulations. The missing information on the existing data bank for the emissivity and other optical properties of radiating gases and particulates should also be identified. Approaches to eliminate those deficiencies should be proposed. c. RV Flight Test Plasma Measurement Instrumentation: Develop methods to measure plasma levels (electron densities, boundary layer thickness, and collision frequency) on a RV during reentry. Currently, indirect methods such as electromagnetic interactions are used to estimate plasma levels. However, techniques, such as Langmuir probes, are needed to provide some direct measure of these quantities. Regimes of validity (e.g., laminar flow vs turbulent) for the particular method or methods chosen must be clearly identified. d. Fast Boresight Error Computer Code: In order to perform Monte Carlo six-degree-of-freedom digital simulations of homing RVs, a more general and efficient algorithm for calculation of on-line phase shift and attenuation due to plasma is needed. Current techniques involve either massive look-up tables or simple algorithms. These tables are generated at enormous computational expense and are good for only one particular antenna and limited frequencies. The simple algorithms are based on such concepts as thin layer theory which can easily handle variations in antenna geometries but are overly restrictive in terms of the allowable plasma layer thickness and densities. Codes developed for this purpose should be applicable to a wide range of antenna configurations, frequencies, plasma properties, transmitted polarization, etc. e. Plasma Properties Database: The frequent use in the reentry community of plasma data suggests the need for the development of a semi-empirical plasma properties database. Such a database would be extremely useful in preliminary design, simulation, and research activities in the reentry vehicle community. The objective of this SBIR effort would be to generate a comprehensive document on reentry vehicle plasma properties. This document should reflect all pertinent ground and flight test data and employ state-of-the-art computational techniques and incorporate this data into a semi-empirical methodology suitable for making rapid, approximate estimates of plasma properties. The semi-empirical methodology developed should be appropriate for both graphical (or tabular) and computer based implementations.

Create new or adapt existing methods of on-site study using surficial and intrusive techniques to fully characterize the subsurface environment of a site. Standard procedures often rely on the use of a single method of site evaluation, such as multiple boreholes spaced throughout a location, requiring a large budget to be expended for characterization of a single location.

Basic research is required in several areas related to this topic. Mathematical models are required for many of the systems of interest, including those occurring in propulsion, robotics, and laser optics. Effective mathematical understanding, using both analytical and numerical tools, is needed for nonlinear equations such as those for transonic flow, laser focusing, detonation, stability of shear flows, geometrically exact elastically, and nonstandard viscoelastic media. Capabilities for solving the partial differential equations modeling physical systems need to be vastly increased. This calls for research in computational mathematics, especially related to solving such problems on parallel architectures. Improvements in parallel computing environments as well as methods for dynamically mapping algorithms on to parallel architectures are needed. Research is needed in several areas of mathematical control theory, including adaptive control and distributed parameter control. Research should address novel methods for dealing with nonlinear dynamics as well as model uncertainty and robustness. Research should focus on the mathematics of dynamics and control in areas applicable to control of systems occurring in large space structures, robotics, or control of fluid flow and combustion processes. Artificial intelligence approaches may be combined with control theory in order to control complex decentralized systems. Research in intelligent control methods, which couples these approaches, is needed. Advances in software engineering and knowledge-based systems will be needed to implement computational models and control algorithms. Research is needed in knowledge-based systems with improved mechanisms for temporal reasoning for application of real-time critical problems. Research in software engineering should address issues of reusability, better programming environments, and the need to monitor change dynamically. Future Air Force operations will require more effective methods for the design of complex systems and the optimization of design with respect to performance and life-cycle costs of the systems. Research in optimization is needed to develop the mathematics necessary to support and implement design optimization and control. As part of this process, research in optimization of infinite-dimensional systems is needed; this has applications to such areas as structural design and integrated structural and control design.

For post-impact fuzing, hermetic components often will not suffice. Micro-circuit chips and lead frames must be rigidly encapsulated and posted in order to enhance their ability to survive in a high-G shock environment.
