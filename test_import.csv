Learning each tool is extremely time-consuming and designers are typically required to delegate much of the work to specialists, who are difficult to find. Furthermore, maintaining the system and adapting the tools to new projects is expensive and time consuming. Thus, a warhead specific CAE/CAD system which is developed using the most recent technologies is desired to eliminate these problems and provide a platform that can be used for more advanced development work. State-of-the-art simulation technologies that must be addressed include fracture mechanics for liner separation and tear prediction, burn simulation around 3-D wave shapers, and improved simulation of the effects of explosive-liner interaction at the edges of liners.

A single Graphical User Interface (GUI) should provide the designer's interface to the system and allow for accessing and controlling resources.

The hydrocode will need to be modular and easily modifiable to permit the adaptation to new warhead technologies.,"To develop the software system according to specifications realized under Phase 1. The contractor will develop the software system around modular, modern object oriented structures and RAD (Rapid Software Development) tools that can be quickly adapted to new warhead design. This effort will involve expanding the GUI and solver to deal with real systems, validating the computer design with the real systems, and addressing the problems identified above. The software system design must also be made compliant with secure networking protocols.","DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: This CAE system can be used in commercial engineering to design, manufacture and inspect complex surfaces such as those found on appliance housings, automobile bodies, furniture or machine parts. This tool enables the engineer/designer to not only design these components, but also to conduct the necessary stress analyses and fit checks, then generate the numerical control instructions for fabrication and inspection. In all commercial engineering design, the stress analysis techniques are used extensively to check out all mechanical part designs prior to committing to hardware fabrication. The stress analyses portion of the CAE will be developed using the latest cross platform object oriented (OO) programming techniques. Almost all current finite element codes utilize non-portable structure programming languages, such as C and Fortran. The transition to a modular, object oriented approach will permit complex general purpose solutions to product design problems to be replaced with easy to use, product specific design/simulation packages that are quickly adapted from the modules.",1,"""Explosively Formed Penetrator Warhead"", Richard Fong and William Ng; Tech Report U184; ""Three Dimensional Computer Simulation of Non-Axisymmetric EFP Warheads"", R.

Monolithic arrays are necessary for ultra-fast hyperspectral x-ray imaging enabling immediate discernment of material composition defects and anomalies at production rates in all kinds of products including propellants and explosives, as well as identifying material in security screening applications. CZT monolithic arrays can be found through careful screening which can be used with very high flux output x-ray sources to perform the hyperspectral imaging in milliseconds. Presently it is not known how to consistently fabricate such arrays. The present method of screening CZT material for such excellent arrays requires fabrication and operational testing. This is a long, arduous task with very low yield. Most monolithic arrays, when exposed to high x-ray flux as commonly used for rapid inspection, suffer from ""electronic polarization"" which limits inspection throughput and is defined below. CZT is fabricated using the High-Pressure Bridgeman Technique. It is then cut and pixilated to form monolithic arrays that seem to exhibit electronic polarization when exposed to high x-radiation flux. Whereas, if cut and fabricated into single pixel elements, it does not show polarization under the same high flux. When operated in pulse mode polarization is observed in the detectors as they are exposed to an increasing radiation flux. Polarization causes a decrease in observed electronic pulses whereas an increase is expected. Pulse events stop altogether as the flux is further increased. Recent work seems to indicate that CZT material that polarizes when pixilated as monolithic arrays often do not polarize when formed into single pixel devices. This solicitation is to study the polarization effect clearly establishing whether single pixel devices of the same material do actually behave differently from arrays; establish and affirm the CZT (microscopic) properties which cause the polarization; and develop monolithic arrays which do not polarize when radiated with high flux. The study must concentrate on flux rates of over one million photons per second. Phase 1 proposals must detail how the study will be performed, describing the contractor equipment to measure the electronic pulses from single photon events in CZT at over one million photons per second, and describing contractor equipment to create the high x-ray photon events. The study must include that of polycrystalline versus single crystal CZT and the crystal lattice direction between the electronic contacts versus electronic properties.",391,2637,1,No,No,No,,"Clearly establish if single pixel CZT devices of the same material behave differently in polarization from pixilated arrays. If that is the case, theorize the reason. Determine means to prevent polarization within the arrays. Prove through experimentation that the conjectures are valid. Phase II: Through experimentation clearly establish the cause of polarization and means of preventing it. Fabricate and test numerous samples of the polarization free CZT.",,"- DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: CZT is currently the semiconductor material whose characteristics are deemed best for x-ray spectroscopy sensors operating at room temperature. Polarization affects are the largest impediment to the creation of very fast line scanners and staring arrays from CZT. Such devices have broad application in the x-ray spectroscopy, imaging of gamma radiation sources, non-destructive inspection field, the medical diagnostic field, and the detection of illicit substances. Systems built for these broad applications could be vastly improved by cheap, high quality CZT. DoD applications include all standard x-ray and gamma ray inspection techniques (especially inspection of munition items), medical diagnostic procedures, and multi-spectral x-ray imaging which is just evolving, Compton cameras for detection of radioactive material, inspection of munitions, inspection of closed containers, illicit substance detection. CZT in the battlefield will be the sensor of choice for detection and imaging of radioactive material. For example, Compton cameras are used for finding small volumes of radioactive material.

As a result, advanced acoustic sensors are exploited to acquire ground vehicle information, such as target locations, target movement, target types, etc. The use of networked acoustic sensors to detect, track and classify single vehicle targets in ranges up to 1000 meters has been demonstrated. However, the detection, tracking, and classification of multiple vehicles in a target rich environment remains a technical challenge. In addition, the field commanders often want to know the numerical size of an enemy convoy that consists of heavy and light vehicles. The current acoustic sensor designs (either individual or networked), employing algorithms based on acoustic signature characteristics such as the engine firing rate (EFR) and sound pressure level (SPL), have difficulty in detecting, tracking, and classifying multiple vehicles when they are closely spaced (around 50m to 200m apart). The inability to detect and determine the number of targets in multiple target scenarios would effect the field commanders' decisions for fire missions. The use of advanced signal processing techniques such as adaptive beamforming would potentially detect multiple vehicles in a target rich environment by zeroing or canceling out the effects of neighboring vehicles in multi-vehicle scenario. The objective of this research is to investigate and develop a novel technique and algorithm to detect and count multiple vehicle targets of interest, and then count the interested vehicles in a clutter environment in a 1000m square grid in all atmospheric conditions and at any time of day. The TCT would enable the acoustic sensors to detect, classify and count vehicles varying from wheel to track, diesel to turbine engine, and/or light to heavy, in any formation entering the designated 1000 m square grid.",296,1952,1,No,No,No,,"Define operational scenario, and sensor configuration and design.

Lifting and moving 103 pound projectiles is a strenuous and fatiguing task which needs to be made easier and faster than it is today. Any time a towed weapon platform moves, all ammo has to be put back onto the prime mover truck and then again downloaded when it reaches its new firing point destination. Moving of the howitzer takes place numerous times during a single day.

To assist soldiers in the execution of their mission, a lightweight,one man portable, low cost human mechanical amplification hardware/device would make the task of moving heavy projectiles significantly easier. The hardware/device should be easy to set up and carry by one person in a field environment under all kinds of environmental conditions. The hardware/device is required to lift items up to a height of 7 feet at a speed faster than current manual capabilities.

The MEMS-based fuzing components shall significantly reduce fuze size and weight at reduced manufacturing cost with reduced power requirements, and also minimize fuze debris and resulting collateral damage when used on non-high-explosive mortars, particularly in Operations Other Than War (OOTW) and urban environments.","Current pyrotechnic fuzes such as the M84A1 Time Fuze possess several detractive features. They are quite heavy, occupy a large volume, are expensive to manufacture, and produce a large variability in fuze function times. One contributor to the significant variability in timing is due to the fact that the burning rate of the pyrotechnic delay mixture is temperature sensitive. For applications where low collateral damage is required, this type fuze is unacceptable. However, current electronics technologies such as Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMs) offer significant potential application to fuze component technology in munitions to include safe & arming devices, setback g-switches, accelerometers, and micro-actuators. This technology enables the significant benefits of reduced component weight and size, parts elimination, and reduced manufacturing and assembly cost for improved affordability. The insertion of this commercial technology into specific ordnance items further offers capability for reducing collateral damage when used in non-explosive munitions in urban environments and OOTW - again due to the greatly reduced size, weight, parts distribution within the fuzing, and corresponding reduced impact energies. Recent advances in MEMS technology indicate that an improved electronic fuze or an improved proximity fuze addressing all the shortcomings of pyrotechnic fuzes could be designed and prototypes demonstrated that could achieve the following Phase I & II specific design and performance goals. a. The MEMS-based fuze shall withstand the severe launch environments of typical mortar cartridges. The fuze must be capable of sensing two independent launch signatures and must possess a dual independent safe and arm (S&A) mechanism utilizing two of these launch signatures. Some environments which can be sensed for the non-lethal mortar fuze S&A are setback, set-forward at barrel exit, and flight air pressure / flow. b. The proposed MEMS-based fuze shall have a small pyrotechnic output for integration into a payload dispersal mechanism c. The proposed fuze shall be either an electronic time based fuze with a fuze setter capability or a proximity fuze. Design concepts providing the most accurate burst height timing are preferred. The fuze shall be accurate to within .05 seconds of the preset function time. If other than a proximity MEMS fuze design is proposed, the design shall also contain a feature enabling the fuze function time to be inductively set from 0.25 sec to 50 seconds prior to firing using a hand held fuze setting device. The proposed MEMS fuze shall reduce fuze and S&A weight by at least 60 %, and reduce size/volume by one order of magnitude. (As a sample proximity fuze baseline for comparison, the present M734 Proximity Fuze and safe and arm device weigh 183 grams, without the secondary explosives, so the proposed MEMS-based fuze would therefore need to reduce the weight down to 70 grams. As a sample time fuze baseline, the current M84A1 Time Fuze has a mass of 0.8 kg and occupies a volume of approximately 178 cm3). d. Debris from fuze function shall be lightweight to minimize collateral damage. Use of MEMS based componentry enables fuze and S&A designs with fewer parts and more distributed components to help reduce fuze debris-related collateral damage upon functioning. A 40% reduction in fuze parts shall be achieved. e. The MEMS based fuze design shall also specify the type of power supply, e.g., a fuel cell. The power supply shall provide the fuze with approximately 30 mA / 3.5 volts sufficient to last the entire mortar flight duration. The power supply shall be no larger than .35 inch in diameter and .5 inch long. f. Improved affordability of the MEMS based fuze shall be supported with design-to-cost comparative data between proposed MEMS-based design and existing mortar fuzes.

Leaders must be able to rapidly select the most able soldiers for novel, unexpected group operations; or to replace missing team members; or to right-size their teams for a mission. Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) will enable remotely stationed groups, or groups of geographically dispersed individuals, to engage in automated, supported self - development, or train both by individualized instruction through CBI and ITS and in group discussion, problem solving, and mission scenario and simulation exercises. Knowledge-based resources and competencies, especially tacit knowledge, will be key drivers of future organizational and leader effectiveness. Future leaders will not only be required to acquire knowledge, but also leverage it in the face of organizational change and adaptation. These modes of learning will be valuable for traditional general knowledge and problem-solving skill training for cognitive readiness as well as for just-in-time training for expeditionary missions. Collaborative problem centered adaptive learning is a proven learning technology ideally suited for this need. Properly implemented, collaborative problem centered learning can enhance student motivation and focus, increase rapid knowledge acquisition, and promote group problem solving and teamwork skills. Embedding automatic, continuous, and cumulative assessment and feedback for individual and group knowledge and performance would materially improve the effectiveness and logistic utility of this mode of learning. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a promising technology for this purpose because it can evaluate the content of free-form verbal contributions (potentially in speech as well as typed). LSA is automatically trained on existing bodies of relevant text rather than through laborious expert-knowledge extraction and hand-coding. Object - oriented programming approaches can encapsulate knowledge for re-use and world wide distribution on the tactical internet. Natural language processing technologies, including voice recognition and speech generation are improving rapidly to capture and digitize spoken communications for interaction with text knowledge bases. Two-way natural language dialog would be useful, but text - based assessment, interaction, and planning is essential. Applied research is needed to develop intelligent software agents that use the best of these technologies for embedding automatic, continuous, and cumulative assessment and tutorial feedback in collaborative learning environments. To track the knowledge levels of each potential team member and the total cognitive readiness of a team, methods are needed to continually and cumulatively assess the knowledge of each member and the state of shared and functionally integrated group competence, and to do so in a valid manner that does not disrupt cohesion and the practice of teamwork skills. Research is needed for unobtrusive and tutorially effective assessment for development of individual knowledge and effective team collaboration. A major requirement of the assessment component is that it measure and provide tutorial feedback on the ability of individuals and groups to create their own problem solution options, and make their own plans, rather than only to choose among alternatives provided on multiple choice tests. A very valuable addition to learning and performance in these situations would be instant access to highly pertinent stored textual information containing relevant doctrine historical accounts, after-action reports, procedural instructions, or briefing discussions from similar training or operational situations, during reachback in remote operations, or during preparation at home stations. An intelligent software agent based on these advanced technologies will monitor the semantic content of computer presented instructional material, open-ended student or participant answers, questions, and comments, and search the text repositories for documents or parts thereof that it determines to be most relevant to current participant concerns and most likely to provide new information, examples, or ideas that are at the same time understandable to the recipients. Attention to interface and usability issues will be crucial. The agent will also be designed to enhance the DOD's status as a learning organization through feedback-based adaptive evaluation and refinement of it use of archived experience in the University After Next.",711,5038,1,No,No,No,,"The phase I effort will result in a proof-of-concept technology for the objectives and description of the topic. It will demonstrate the feasibility of a technology-based software agent to assist leaders in assessing and selecting the right members for future missions, evaluate free-text open ended knowledge expression and problem solution generation in a problem centered collaborative learning environment, provide feedback and recommend training. Phase I proposals must include a detailed market survey activity and letters of interest. Commitment from potential commercial partners must be obtained prior to Phase II consideration.","Phase II will fully develop, test and validate an intelligent software agent for continuous embedded assessment of open-ended learner verbal productions in a distributed program-centered collaborative learning environment. Proposals should assume that the technology will run in the platform-independent web-based infrastructure of ADL. Phase II will fully develop, test and validate a technology-based intelligent software agent to interface users to large scale libraries of information and experience of all sorts, such as those in the University After Next. It will provide data and analyses useful to leaders in the planning of unit and overall organizational composition of personnel for new missions.","Almost every present-day industry or business has a need to train personnel frequently in new operating procedures and problem-solving methods, and to select individual and teams capable of generating and verbally communicating task-relevant knowledge and solutions. No flexible automatically constructed assessment and tutorial capability for this training and assessment purpose, based on libaries of textual knowledge, such as the one described herein, exists. The development of such a technology will help Government and Private Sector organizations meet the needs of rapidly changing markets, technologies, and labor forces in a timely, effective and economical manner. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: Every large industry that trains and selects individuals and teams for knowledge and problem solving activities, and has repositories of textual information that is relevant for future plans and actions, is a potential customer for this technology.",1,"Shute, V.

This technique would replace polishing as the final finishing step for transparent ceramics and render them optically transparent.,"Transparent ceramics such as sapphire, ALON, are at, or reaching, the stage of manufacturing where they can be used in transparent armor systems1. Single crystal sapphire has been grown commercially in sheets as large as 12"" x 14"". The DoD is currently funding a 6.3 effort to increase the manufacturing capability to produce ALON, with the goal of producing 14"" x 20"" windows. At this time polishing these materials for large windows is prohibitively expensive. Polishing large curved windows is even more expensive. For large windows polishing can be 50% of the cost of the finished window. A low cost alternative to polishing using a coating technique would greatly cut the costs of using advanced transparent materials in transparent armor systems. It should also allow for the repair of transparent armor windows that are scratched or have minor cracks, thereby reducing the life cycle costs of the windows. The low cost finishing alternative must be compatible with the present manufacturing techniques, and materials used in making transparent armor. Techniques such as coating with an index matching glass or a polymer based coating, that will give an optical finish or be easier to polish will be considered. Because of the high index of refraction of sapphire, ALON, and spinel it will be difficult to make a polymer with an index of refraction high enough to match these materials. It may not be necessary to match it exactly though. Techniques that reduce the time and cost of polishing without coatings, will also be considered. Many advanced polishing techniques have been developed for advanced optics2. The advanced optical systems require great precision in polishing. Transparent Armor applications do not require this degree of precision. It may be possible to modify these techniques for low cost polishing.",293,1827,1,No,No,No,,"Identify the most promising technique to give a low cost near optical quality finish suitable for use in transparent armor. Demonstrate the feasibility of the chosen low cost alternative to polishing can be used on samples of sapphire at least 2"" x 2"" x 0.25."" and give at least 70% in line-transmission in the visible spectrum and less than 10 % haze as measured by a Garner Haze Guard. Demonstrate that the alternative technique to polishing chosen is compatible with autoclaving sapphire to sapphire with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) interlayer and polyurethane interlayer and bonding sapphire to polycarbonate with a polyurethane interlayer, using 2"" x 2"" x 0.25"" sapphire plates.","Scale up polishing procedure to polish sapphire at least 12"" x 14.

Demonstrate that the bonding in the autoclave operation is at least as strong as a autoclave bond using traditionally polished sapphire using a standard peel test.","Any low cost alternative to the costly polishing of hard transparent ceramics would greatly reduce there costs and allow them to be used in many more applications than has been previously imagined. Dual use applications could include armored bank cars, armored cars for police, VIP vehicle protection and architectural windows. OPERATING AND SUPPORT COST (OSCR) REDUCTION: Lighter transparent armor systems will increase the pay loads in vehicles and reduce the were and tear on suspensions, reduce fuel costs, and reduce the manufacturing cost of the components needed to bear the weight of heavy transparent armor systems. All these will result in operating cost reductions.

An example of an initial effect is the launch area cross wind error for the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). During its ballistic flight, a projectile is affected by wind, density, and the transition from supersonic to subsonic flight. In the terminal phase, deployable munitions may be affected by wind, fog, cloud, or other weather. Present meteorological systems (mainly the balloon borne radiosonde) are only accurate enough to permit correction for a portion of these effects. New sensors, new patterns for deploying sensors, and new methods for information fusion offer the opportunity for substantial improvements in accuracy of determination of the crucial meteorological variables. There is a need for a compact hardware and software system for meteorological data fusion for artillery accuracy improvement. The present topic proposes development of such a system for three sensors: wind radar, microwave radiometers, and GPS slant water vapor systems. These systems can measure dynamically the most important meteorological variables, namely wind, temperature and atmospheric water vapor. These variables are also crucial for artillery. Wind radars measure profiles of atmospheric winds by measuring the Doppler shift of clear air radar returns, and microwave profilers infer temperature profiles and water information from microwave brightness measurements. A newer instrument, the GPS slant water vapor sensor, uses the fact that water vapor in the atmosphere causes a delay in the time of arrival of the GPS signal (for details, see the referenced internet site and locations). By determination of the delays for several satellites as each tracks across the sky, the sensor gets a large number of slant path measurements of total water vapor. When such sensors are deployed in arrays, as they have been at the Department of Energy Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site in Oklahoma, tomography can be used to infer three dimensional water vapor distributions. The ideal method for fusion of such data is assimilation into a dynamical meteorological model in such a way that the measurements are required to be consistent with the physics of the atmosphere. Such models also have the advantage of prediction of future atmospheric states. A general method for statistically optimal data assimilation is the so-called 4 D (3 dimensions of space plus one for time) variational scheme. Implementation of such a scheme for the above sensors, or some approximation to it, is one possible method for addressing the problem of the current topic. Technology such as that developed under this topic may be generalized to the weather web project in particular and the sensor web project in general. Because the problem of information fusion and information assimilation is central to future information technology, this topic is also directly applicable to the Information Technology for the Twenty-First Century (IT2) initiative.",461,3027,1,No,No,No,,"The phase I effort should assemble a trial data set from an array of wind radar, microwave radiometers, and slant path GPS moisture systems and describe one or more assimilation techniques suitable to the problem and apply it to a portion of the trial data set.","Develop assimilation techniques and implement on a PC or other portable computer system. Test the data assimilation method on a full-scale data set such as the array of GPS, radar, and radiometric sensors in Oklahoma, and document effects on nowcast and forecast accuracy. Develop and demonstrate a prototype.","Development and delivery of turnkey systems will permit assimilation and use of these new data sources in models with important applications for other military and civilian applications. Examples include use for aviation, operation, prediction of the transport and diffusion of smoke, NBC, and pollutants. Another civilian application is wildfire control. With wind radar, microwave radiometry and GPS slant path water vapor measurements, it is possible to infer the wind temperature, and moisture fields. This information should greatly improve the performance of transport and diffusion models used for modeling movement of pollutants, smoke, and haze. In addition, these measurements can make crucial contributions to the prediction and monitoring of global climate change effects.

Accurate experimental data needed to validate these codes (e.g. verifying scaling laws and providing closure to tubulence parameters) are not only difficult to obtain, but can only be measured in a loboratory or test cell setting. A simple, reliable system for obtaining the desired combustor properties (velocity, temperature, species) would not only benefit the design of gas turbine combustors, but, if capable of being used in the field, would be an excellent diagnostics tool to determine the health of an engine. Such a system could result in significant maintenance savings. Currently used, non-intrusive systems for measuring the fluid flow velocity (e.g. Laser Doppler and Laser Transit Anemometry) are complex and expensive, and cannot be used in the field. Likewise, existing, non-intrusive temperature and species concentration measurement systems are even more complex and expensive, and rely on spectroscopic techniques such as absorption, laser induced fluorescence (LIF), and Raman scattering. These temperature and species measurement techniques require narrow laser line widths to excite a singel rotational vibrational state of the agent species. Laser tunability and restrictive line width requirements have thus hindered using these techniques in practical applications. Laser diode technology has been expertimentally demonstrated to be able to measure fluid flow velocity. Further advances in laser diode technology promise to make the development of the desired laser temperature and species measurement techniques possible and practical, since laser diode techniques do not require narrow laser excitation line widths, but can derive the needed information from broad band excitation provided by suitable flash lamps. Sources are sought to develop a laser diode fluorescence sensor (using broad band excitation sources) that eliminates the current complex imaging requirements for laser coherence. The sensor must enable the determination of temperature and species in a gaseous flow field. The sensor must be cost effective, accurate enough to be capable of verifying gas turbine combustor scaling laws, as well as rugged enough to be used as a potential diagnostics monitoring tool in the field.",337,2293,1,No,No,No,,Perform bench tests to demonstrate the feasibility of laser diode velocimetry (velocity measurements) for combustion applications.

In addition, such a technique would be an invaluable diagnostics tool that could provide early warning of combustor distress, resulting in significantly reduced maintenace costs.

Build prototypes of design to demonstrate capability.","The (Phase III) test bed for this project will be the M230 30-mm cannon. The design of the igniter should consider the following criteria: 1. Size: One possible design would have separate laser and power supply modules. The laser module would fit within the firing pin housing of the M230 cannon. However, this volume is very limited: two concentric, adjacent cylinders 14 mm diameter by 44 mm long and 5 mm diameter by 52 mm long. Thus a laser design external to the cannon (with energy directed to the charge by optical fiber or mirror) may be most suitable if all other criteria are satisfied. The total volume of the power supply and laser are not defined, but must be reasonably compact; a goal of this project will be to determine how small they can be made. 2. Power consumption: Power consumption must be compatible with the platforms on which these cannons are utilized such as Apache helicopters. Performance trade-off needs to be evaluated, but lower power consumption will be advantageous. 3. Weight: Weight must be minimized, especially in the power supply, to make the igniter system compatible with air platforms. 4. Performance: The igniter shall provide prompt, reliable ignition of the gun charge to provide full gun function (typically 4 msec) within the normal operating parameters. This requirement usually can be met with initiation of the first element of the charge (""primer"") within 1 millisecond or less of the fire signal. Firing rate is 625 rounds/minute for up to 50 shots. 5. Environmental Limitations: The first stage energetic material in the gun charge (that which is impacted by the laser beam) can be modified to enhance performance with the laser. Any material used must meet normal sensitivity and safety standards. In addition materials considered must be lead and heavy metal free and environmentally friendly in production, use, and demilitarization. Consideration of next generation materials such as metastable intermolecular compounds is encouraged. 6.

The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center has successfully lightened the load for front-line troops by introducing a body armor system that weighs 35-percent less than the current Personnel Armor System Ground Troop (PASGT) body armor system. This new system uses a ballistic fabric vest that provides fragment and handgun protection. Rigid ceramic plates inserted into the vest provide ballistic protection against 7.62-mm rifle ammunition (NIJ Level III). This system has a total weight of approximately 16.5 pounds. These current designs, although an improvement, are still considered heavy, the insert plate is bulky, limits soldier mobility, increases soldier heat load and does not provide maximum ballistic protection to the entire torso or knife/stab protection. This effort will incorporate a new conformal body armor design to provide flexible full-torso ballistic protection and a material system to reduce system weight under 16.5 pounds for NIJ Level IV protection, while providing greater comfort and mobility to the soldier.

This makes it feasible, for example, to develop new tunable spatial light modulators (SLMs) where phase modulation and photosensitivity features are integrated in a single medium. This confluence in turn will result in reduced complexity in manufacturing, dramatically reduced cost, and higher reliability. One anticipates enhanced performance, specifically in relation to larger phase modulation, higher spatial resolution, faster response time, and very little power consumption. Specifically, for the example of the integrated SLM system, this translates into significantly improved performance as compared to the conventional split-function SLMs. The highly nonlinear and high sensitivity optical material can be combined with nanoparticle/matrix networks thereby producing ""intelligent"" nonlinear optical systems that they are reconfigurable, adaptive, have memory and can learn. This will lead us into a new fertile ground of photonics that will have demonstrable applicability for both civilian and DoD applications.

While the THz regime, defined as frequencies between 0.3 - 10.0 THz, offers many technical advantages (e.g., wider bandwidth, improved spatial resolution, and compactness) the major motivation for the development of this submillimeter-wave region between microwaves and the infrared has been applications in molecular spectroscopy. In fact, in this final year of the twentieth century, the solid-state electronics capability within the THz frequency regime remains extremely limited from a basic signal source and systems perspective [1]. At the same time, many new potential applications of THz technology are rapidly emerging. While a number of novel commercial applications related to general spectroscopic probing have been demonstrated (e.g., polar materials, human tissue, flames, etc. [2, 3]), advances in nanotechnology, molecular chemistry and biological science have already begun to chart the course for new and important applications of THz electronics in the coming century. Specifically, new research has identified physical mechanisms within the THz regime that suggest advantages for the sensing of both chemical and biological agents [4,5]. The recent proliferation of chemical and biological (CB) agents as instruments of warfare and terrorism has lead the DoD to rank the development of early-warning systems for biological, and then chemical, as the highest priorities [6]. Hence these facts combine to compel the development of a THz electronics capability. An effective counter to the C/B threat will only be possible through the development of point and stand-off sensor technology. The key to realizing a militarily useful terahertz technology is to drastically increase the level of integration. Hence, a focused research and development (R&D) effort in an all solid-state circuit technology is required to effectively bridge the THz technology gap. Here, the most successful terahertz device technologies (e.g., Schottky and Heterostructure Barrier Varactors and Schottky mixers) should be applied to realize frequency agile and reliable components in a cost effective manner. This R&D effort will target new fabrication techniques and computer aided design tools appropriate for a planar, integrated, solid-state device/circuit technology. Performance goals must include milliwatt transmit power levels, high sensitivity, large bandwidth and, most importantly, suitability for use in military applications. The desired result will be a battery of transmit/receive module prototypes that will lay the foundation for a future generation of THz electronic systems.

Recent research results on the computer simulation of large active arrays, on the integration of nonlinear device analysis with linear electromagnetic analysis, on multi-resolution and other techniques to make significant increases in simulation speed, on the parallelization of these models, and on hybrid simulation techniques to exploit different aspect of geometry regularity, provide the opportunity for large increases in the capability to analyze very complex planar circuit structures with active devices in the frequency domain and to optimize them. Multi-resolution time domain techniques provide the opportunity to utilize finite difference time domain techniques for the analysis of large, complex circuits in the time domain. Advances have been made in the modeling of thermal effects of active devices in arrays and the integration of these models with the device and EM models. Thermal effects are proving very important for arrays of active devices and their effects must be considered in circuit analysis and design. CAD software taking advantage of these new techniques will provide the capability for first pass design of packaged microwave and millimeter wave circuits, with a resulting reduction in design cost.

Successful low-cost methodologies and technologies will result in the development of new and significantly improved blast-resistant facades, such that failure can be controlled to withstand and mitigate large-blast pressure effects.","Windows and glass facades are essential elements in building design. However, they are the weak link in facade design, as they will typically fail before any structural element, when the structure is subjected to blast overpressure loading. For workspace and structural protection, windows must be able to resist blast overloads, and then if and when failure initiates, it must be in a controlled manner such that flying glass shards and glass debris do not form. Glass debris and shards have been shown to be one of the major sources of fatalities in structures subjected to blast loading conditions. Furthermore, windows have to be anchored as long as possible, since the amount of blast pressures that enters an occupied space is directly proportional to the fenestration space. Limiting the amount of fenestration will limit the blast effects. Standard annealed glass behaves poorly under blast conditions. Not only are the peak allowable pressures low, but this type of glazing breaks into sharp shards. Several other types of glazing are available for large-scale structures, such as thermally tempered glazing (TTG) and polycorbonate glazing (bullet resistant glass). TTG, under blast loading breaks up into small pieces, which would limit injuries and fatalities. Polycorbonate glazings also have favorable behavior under blast loading conditions. Instead of breaking up into small pieces, it develops small cracks that do not beak up into shards. However, it remains as one piece, which after dislodgment from structural attachments, could be an extremely hazardous large flying object. Furthermore, these glazings, which can be designed to withstand higher pressure loading than annealed glass are prohibitively expensive for large-scale structural applications. In addition, to fail properly, their support and attachment interfacial systems must be properly designed. This has been proven to be extremely difficult and current ad hoc attachment methods are structurally unreliable and expensive.",302,2007,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate feasibility by the development of methodologies and technologies for low-cost blast resistant glass. In Phase I, tangible designs of at least one prototype is expected. It should be shown that proposed designs can be scalable and easily integrated and attached within large structural elements.

It should also be shown that the proposed design has superior blast behavior and is cost-effective in comparison with current glass facade designs and technologies.","Develop a fully integrated design and test environment such that commercially viable facades and windows can be retrofitted and attached into large-scale structures. It is expected that final designs should withstand blast pressures that are higher than those currently in use, and that once attached to structural elements that failure can be controlled to result into breakup of harmless fragments or powder.","DUAL USE COMMERCIALIZATION: There are expected to be a large number of dual use applications. New and significantly improved window facades and glazings are needed for blast protection due to explosives, earthquakes, strong winds, and other severe environmental conditions for both military structures and commercial structures. These new glass facades may find applications for secure large-scale commercial and governmental structures, for commercial and military vehicles, transparent armor, aircraft canopies, atrium like designs, and hardened shelters.

Current and emerging horn systems are insufficient for a number of reasons. The frequencies at which the illuminated spot is sufficiently small are too high to penetrate wet soil. Alternatively, unwieldy lower frequency horns are not suitable for coherent signal processing and accurate ranging under the near-field conditions at small standoff distances. Even in the intermediate or far field, their non-planar wave fronts make it difficult to establish unambiguous look direction and timing. The use off-normal incidence is an essential surveying mode. This applies both to subsurface incidence and aboveground incidence angle in the case of elevated antennas. Current imaging systems offer both too much and too little. The processing requirements of tomography or inversion for dielectric content are excessive. The system proposed should offer the option that data can be collected from a substantial standoff distance with off- normal incidence, a mode not seen in subsurface imaging radars. This mode allows innovative signal processing to achieve, in effect, greater resolution and signature detection than current radar systems offer. Required is a radar system that offers as an option a safe standoff distance of at least 1-2 of meters (i.e. not require contact of antenna with ground). It should accommodate off-normal incidence with crosshair, laser, or other means for locating the illuminated spot, with video record. Minimum reflector or array size is desired, with side lobes ideally more than 20 dB below main beam. The incident beam should be focused at or slightly below ground surface with platform elevation of about 2 meters; 3 dB beamwidth at ground surface should not be greater than approximately 0.5 meter. At the ground surface, the beam should be approximately planar. The system should also offer the option of ground contact or near-contact surveying, for maximum ground penetration, frequency range, and discrimination potential. The system need not consist of only one antenna, but can include a reasonably small number of antennas, each optimized for parts of the frequency range and discrimination task, as long as these can operate in close concert with one another and not unduly impede mobility. The final radar system should be mobile, with some manner of position determination and/or distance tracking capability. The distance or position information should be co-registered with the radar and video records for mutual coordination. A single person should be able to move the system smoothly over a surveying transect. A re-orientable antenna support structure should allow an operator to survey to the side of the direction of platform motion. It would be desirable to have the ability to change between horizontal and vertical polarizations (i.e. measuring VV or HH returns) and an ability to measure cross-polarized returns. Transmitted power and dynamic range of the system should be such that (i) a 6cm thick frozen soil layer is discernable at a depth of 30 cm and (ii) a bright reflector (e.g. 30 cm plate or corner reflector) should be discernible beneath at least 30 cm of wet silty soil. Measured data should feature, either directly or by equivalence, amplitude and phase of reflected signal at each frequency relative to known or calibratable transmission amplitudes and phases.

These illicit laboratories are extremely dangerous because of the hazardous chemicals used for the extraction of the finished product. Strong acids such as muriatic, sulfuric and hydriodic are usually present along with strong bases including sodium hydroxide and ammonia. Volatile elements such as sodium, lithium metal and red phosphorus are also sometimes used. Organic solvents such as ether, chloroform, acetone and alcohols are almost always used. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations require that clandestine lab investigators be fully certified as hazardous waste responders. Entry into a clandestine lab to asses the area for chemical hazard requires full personal chemical protection. These areas are extremely dangerous and potentially deadly to criminal investigators. The dangers after fire or explosion are compounded since containers have been destroyed and chemical agents dispersed. Processing chemicals with vapors heavier than air settle in depressed areas making them difficult to detect. This environment is even more hazardous for canines trained to alert on fire accelerants.

The Comanche Tactics and Survivability Expert Planner will enable the weapon system in achieving enhanced survivability and target lethality. The Comanche weapon system incorporates significant technical advances in virtually all its major subsystems. To fully exploit the potential of this advanced, multi-mission weapon system there is a need for effective planners and decision aids to support mission planning and tactical employment. A Tactics Expert system is needed to identify aircraft vulnerability to threat detection and indicate/recommend courses of action that maximize target detection/kill while minimizing own-ship vulnerability. Of particular interest are technologies that can support real-time/near real-time operations. Research is needed to identify integrated solutions that provide a linkage between training/planning and real-time decision support. In addition, approaches are needed that foster cognitive readiness of the crews through consistent and reinforcing tools and methods that transition from training and planning to tactical decision support. The sought after solution will incorporate the effects of significant battlefield conditions including environments, threat capabilities and weapon system operational modes and expected performance. The approach should also provide for learning and adaptation of the model based on actual experience; for example during the course of a campaign the system should be capable of self-update based on the current conditions and mission results. The cockpit implementation must be capable of rapid execution to support real-time/near real-time crew interaction.

While progress is being made on a number of theoretical fronts in understanding individual and social behavior (Pew and Mavor, 1998), there exists a need for parallel development of decision aiding architectures that incorporate emerging theoretical research and technologies which enable examination and correlation of the theoretical research. A variety of artificial intelligence representational and inferencing mechanisms are potentially applicable to the development of IO/IW decision aids, including expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning, and belief networks. However, no data are available to provide a solid empirical basis for a principled selection of the most appropriate inferencing technique (or group of techniques) for a given IO/IW objective and scenario. This effort will focus on identifying candidate architectures and technologies to support the diverse information and inferencing requirements of modern warfare IO/IW decision aiding.

As such these elements offer the ability to incorporate unconventional functionality, such as off-axis focusing, aberration correction, and beam forming elements, into conventional optical systems. For the Army, incorporation of Diffractive Optical Elements within optical systems can offer the advantages of a reduced number of optical elements, reduced weight, and reduced cost. These are key factors, especially in applications such as Unmanned Air Vehicles, and Unmanned Ground Vehicles, where miniaturization is critical. Whereas Diffractive Optical Element technology is being commercialized at a fast rate, its full potential has not yet been realized. Historically, this was due to the lack of suitable fabrication and replication methods; however, today it is clearly due to the lack of complete and general Diffractive Optical Element Computer Aided Design tools. For instance modern fabrication methods, such as e-beam lithography, can currently produce Diffractive Optical Element profiles that cannot be analyzed or designed using conventional analysis methods. However, recent advances in the electromagnetic modeling of Diffractive Optical Elements overcome this limitation. In fact these new tools place no limitation on the size, number of levels, material properties, or aperiodicity of the Diffractive Optical Element .

Because of the molecular binding nature of water molecules, water molecules are transported along with the cations. This technique has been used in civil engineering to dewater dredgings and other high-water content waste solids, consolidate clays, strengthen soft sensitive clays, and increase the capacity of pile foundations. Electro-osmosis has received significant attention in the last 5 years as a method to remove hazardous contaminants from groundwater or to arrest water flow. Although results have shown the technique to be feasible, they have not been remarkable. One limitation of the present application is the use of a constant direct current, not a pulsating current. Currently, electro-osmotic pulse (EOP) technology is being applied to concrete structures. A system has been developed that uses a pulsating direct electric field. The system consists of an electronic control unit that delivers electric pulses to positive electrodes (anodes) inserted into the concrete structure. The negative electrode (cathode) is driven into the exterior soil or buried within the concrete structure outside of the protected area. The pulsating electro-osmosis system consists of a pulse of positive voltage (as seen from the dry side of the concrete wall) and a period of rest when no voltage is applied. The pulse of positive voltage has the greatest duration and amplitude. The electrical pulse causes cations (e.g., Ca++) and associated water molecules to move from the structure's dry side towards the wet side, counter to the direction of flow induced by the hydraulic gradient, thus preventing water penetration through buried concrete structures. By using a pulsating excitation; electrode polarization, cation depletion, and overdrying of the concrete are prevented.

With the mandate to utilize commercial components as much as possible to lower acquisition costs, non-hermetic, plastic encapsulated microcircuits (PEMs) are quickly being designed into new weapon systems and spare/redesigned electronics. To reduce the chances of corrosion on the surface of the IC within a PEM, the Army has initiated a Manufacturing Technology program to provide near-hermetic protection to ICs while they are still in the wafer form. The protection this coating provides will more readily allow the use of PEMs in weapon systems by eliminating moisture susceptibility concerns with off-the-shelf PEMs. This protective coating enables the development of new material formulations and processes that can focus on packaging requirements other than hermetic protection.

For example: 1. Transient flow phenomena has been shown in recent tests to be of utmost importance to jet-interaction modeling; yet, achieving even quasi-steady state solutions requires completely unacceptable computational times. Furthermore, domain decomposition on multiprocessor machines does not solve the run time dilemma because of the ever continuing need for greater grid resolution. 2. Achieving adequate grid resolution to capture the flowfield features becomes an unacceptably difficult task using structured grids. 3. Fluid and chemistry time scales are incompatible with consequent stiff matrices and small solution time steps. 4. Jet induced flow separation is not adequately modeled with two-equation, Reynolds averaged, turbulence models. 5. Current flowfield chemistry is laminar, not turbulent. 6.

This approach expresses the conduction heat flux as a product of the conductivity of the material and local temperature gradient. Thus it implies that the conduction speed is infinite in any medium regardless of its temperature and composition. This assumption is generally acceptable in the majority of heat transfer problems.

Specifically, we seek improvements in synthesis of microarrays and surface attachment chemistries. Enhancements in microarray technology supports the DoD's Biomedical Technology Area program in Infectious Diseases of Military Importance, and more specifically, the DTO MD12 Anti-Parasitic Drug Program.","The focus of this effort will be to improve or replace the existing technology for the photolithographic synthesis or mechanical deposition (i.e., printing) of DNA sequences in silico. We seek an automated, alternative that will generate high-density oligonucleotide arrays or DNA de novo arrays with the following minimum characteristics: for oligonucleotide arrays, in silico synthesis method that does not employ photolithographic masks, oligo-separation distances 95%, and oligo-nucleotide lengths >30 bp; and for mechanical deposition of DNA microarray, diameters 10,000 DNA spots/oligonucleotides in silico not larger than 25 mm x 76 mm. The arrayer must synthesize or distribute the DNA product evenly across the entire diameter of the spot. In addition, the automated system should be self-contained in a humidity-controlled, HEPA-filtered chamber with the capacity to generate up to 100 slides per iteration. The design should include a high-throughput capacity for processing multiple 96 or 384 well plates. Printed or synthesized arrays should be amenable for reading on standard confocal laser scanners. Furthermore, we seek improvements in the derivitized surface substrates (not limited to silicon) that enhance DNA attachment, access for probe hybridization, and enhance signal-to-noise ratios during laser epi-fluorescence scanning. The most common methods for microarray generation involve either deposition of DNA products or proprietary photolithographic methods. The former approach involves machined, split-pins which contact a derivitized silicon surface (silanized or poly-L-lysine coated glass slides). Pins typically deposit 1-4 nL volumes of product with spot diameters of 100-150 m and center-to-center diameters of 200-225 m. A drawback to this process is that far more DNA product is aspirated (mL) than deposited (nL), the pins may become deformed after numerous surface strikes, and maximum density cannot exceed 8,000 spots per slide. Furthermore, an artifact of this process is that spotted material tends to collect at the periphery creating a ""doughnut"" effect upon probe hybridization and confocal laser scanning. The latter approach may yield high-density arrays but the approach is considered proprietary, the manufacturing of photolithographic masks are cost prohibitive, and the oligonucleotide lengths limited to < 25 bp due to reduced coupling efficiencies. Improved methods for high-density DNA microarray generation will facilitate more efficient use of limited research resources. Furthermore, the capacity to include a higher density of DNA products on a solid support will increase our capacity and reduce costs for our drug discovery efforts to identify and validate candidate drug targets. Finally, the refinement of the printing process has broad appeal in other areas of military and civilian importance. This is a technology that may be considered for the dual use science and technology (DUST) and the dual use applications (DUAP) programs.",433,2993,1,No,No,No,,Evaluate and demonstrate utility of selected approach for meeting deposition criteria.

Clearly, a potential outcome of this technology is a state of the art approach which may be considered as a DUST/DUAP technology. Furthermore, the utility of this improved microarray technology is that it may serve as a common platform for drug and vaccine discovery, diagnosis, toxicology studies, and resistance monitoring for other infectious diseases of import to include leishmaniasis, HIV, and pathogenic bacterial and viral organisms.

The formation of new blood vessels is a critical component in the healing of many injuries, including surgical wounds, ulcers, non-union fractures (1, 2, 3), as well as the progression of diseases such as cancer (4). In addition, neoangeogenesis can be affected by common therapies, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (5), and common personal behaviors, such as smoking (6). The ability to determine early in the course of an injury that there is an abnormally low rate of neovascularization could result in early intervention with standard treatments such as surgical intervention or antibiotic treatment. This technology could also identify patients who could be the best candidates for treatment with emerging angiogenic drugs, such as fibroblast growth factor (7) and platelet-derived growth factor (8). Additionally, evidence of on-going or apparently adequate angiogenesis may help soldiers avoid unnecessary additional tests or surgical interventions. More effective determination of neovascularization could reduce the morbidity of injuries, and potentially reduce mortality resulting from complications. In this fashion, soldiers may be returned to full duty more quickly, and with a shorter course of rehabilitation. The goal of this solicitation is to develop the methodology to identify new vessel formation and confirm the validity of the technique(s). This could be accomplished by a number of complementary approaches involving imaging technology, improved contrast media or data reduction. Imaging technologies could include: (a) magnetic resonance angiography and/or perfusion (8); (b) doppler ultrasound angiography (9); or (c) CT angiography. Improved contrast media could be developed, increasing the sensitivity and resolution of current methods. Enhanced data reduction and analysis algorithms could be added to these other technologies to further accomplish this goal of improved detection of neoangiogenisis. Validity could be confirmed using phantoms that mimic human physiology and/or animal models of wound healing.",303,2140,1,No,No,No,,The objective of Phase I is to develop the screening modality to identify neoangiogenesis.,"The objective of Phase II is to evaluate the technology in patients, as a potential marker for the progression and severity of injury or disease.","The development of a screening technique to identify neoangiogenesis would provide commercial potential in several clinical settings. This phase would involve clinical trials of the screening modality for Food and Drug Administration review of safety and efficacy. The complementary military application of this technology would include the ability to more efficiently detect and treat devitalized tissue associated with projectile injuries, crush injuries, blast injuries, and envenomization events from snakes and spiders. The utilization of this technology in military operational settings could contribute to more effective surgical intervention, reduce the numbers of surgeries required for wound debridement, and reduce morbidity and mortality REFERENCES 1).Wynendaele, W., van Oosterom, A.T., Pawinski, A., de Bruijn, E.A., Maes, R.A. 1998.

During the Persian Gulf War, more than half of Coalition troops reported at least one episode of diarrhea within 3-4 months of deployment. More recently, rates of diarrhea ranging from 25% to 50% have been observed in ground forces participating in exercises in Thailand, Egypt, and South America. TD is also a frequent problem aboard U.S. Naval vessels following foreign port calls; more than a thousand man-hours were lost to TD among sailors and flight crews subsequent to a 3-day visit to Alexandria, Egypt, by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. Bacterial pathogens are the etiologic agents in at least 50% of all laboratory-confirmed cases of TD. The most common of these agents is enterotoxin-producing E. coli, or ETEC; Shigella and Campylobacter are also important contributors to the overall burden of TD, and in some cases may be more significant than ETEC. The mix of diarrheal agents is dependent upon the geographic location, season, and length-of-stay of the traveler. An effective vaccine against TD should be aimed at all three of the agents. In addition to the benefit to civilian travelers, such a vaccine would substantially reduce the risk of TD for deployed military personnel and thus contribute to force readiness. There are currently no vaccines available for TD; however, clinical challenge studies and examination of the natural history of diarrheal disease indicate that at least short-term protection is attainable. The Department of Defense has long maintained basic and applied research programs on each of the etiologic pathogens of TD; it is now feasible to consider combining the vaccine candidate products developed in these programs to produce a multivalent vaccine. A number of antigens, including lipopolysaccharide of Shigella, colonization factor antigens and the enterotoxin of ETEC, and flagellin of Campylobacter contribute to protective immunity.

Laboratory studies have shown that the potential for lapses in performance due to insufficient sleep may adversely impact on the inability to maintain high levels of performance around-the-clock. These studies show decrements in performance of 25% for each 24 hours of continued wakefulness. Cognitive function impairment with increasing sleep deprivation is a prelude to catastrophic events. In critical operations which must be sustained over extended periods of time and which require maximal effective performance levels, cognitive states of individual soldiers in units must be known with certainty by Commanders. This will allow timely, judicious decisions by field commanders, in enforcing sleep discipline for soldiers in need and thus assure effective group performance.

Multiple cycles of screening and structural modification will be performed, to obtain inhibitors that can serve as model compounds for anti-botulinum toxin drug development.","Botulinum toxins are among the most lethal protein toxins, and are considered to be potential biowarfare and bioterrorist threat agents. Although botulinum vaccines are effective, safe and effective therapeutic drugs that could be used to treat personnel exposed to botulinum toxins are also needed. Unfortunately, at present, no such drugs exist. To this end, a promising avenue of research has been indicated by the discovery that that botulinum toxins are zinc metalloproteases, highly specific for certain proteins involved in neurotransmission (Schiavo, et al., 1995). Hydrolysis of these proteins, catalyzed by botulinum toxins, blocks neurotransmitter release. Therefore, compounds that inhibit the proteolytic activity of botulinum toxins could prove useful for anti-toxin drug development. Obtaining such compounds requires the ability to generate and test very large numbers of samples in a short time. Current methods in combinatorial chemistry are capable of generating many thousands of compounds in a few days or less. For our purposes, libraries may consist of organic compounds, peptides, pseudopeptides, or peptidomimetics. Based on work with types A and B botulinum neurotoxins (Schmidt, et al., 1998; Martin, et al., 1999) and with similar enzymes (Powers and Harper, 1986: Turbanti, et al., 1993), the presence of a potential zinc-binding moiety such as sulfhydryl, hydroxylamino, or N-carboxyalkyl is necessary for inhibitory activity. For inhibition of type A toxin (but not type B), the presence of a guanidino group in each compound is also required (Schmidt, et al., 1998).",237,1598,1,No,No,No,,"Synthesize four sets of first-generation combinatorial libraries.

Objective force concepts of operation require medical readiness capability for combat casualty care. This capability is achieved by providing initial and sustainment training to medical personnel. Development of modeling and simulation capability holds the most promise to meet the gaps that exist in medical training capability.

The workstation must provide realistic, simulated representations of medical procedures. The system should provide glasses-free, full color, full parallax 3-D images that are projected into free space to provide access for force feedback interfaces. The 3-D images should have all of the characteristics of real 3D objects. The tactile object of the force feedback interface should be accurately co-aligned with the 3D visual image to provide a very realistic surgical training environment.

Regardless of how beneficial these systems are, they do require electricity for their operation and reliance on external generators for this power is impractical and wasteful, particularly because of the small amount of electricity they require. However, the nature of these new kitchens and laundries is such that they are excellent candidates for the application of cogeneration strategies. Configured with efficient and powerful centralized thermal fluid heaters, these new systems need a relatively small amount of electric power. For the thermal fluid based kitchen, the heat load varies from 0 to 100 kW, while the electrical needs range from 3 to 5 kW. An acceptable cogenerator must maintain high efficiency (75% or higher) throughout the load range. Cogeneration is the integrated production of heat and electricity to maximize the efficiency of a system. For instance, waste heat from a burner may be used to generate electricity (bottoming cycle), or, waste heat from a generator may be used for heating purposes (topping cycle). One simple example of the topping cycle is scavenging heat from the exhaust of standard onboard logistical-fuel fired generators. Because internal combustion engines are inherently loud, complex and heavy, alternative approaches are sought. Possible technologies include, but are not limited to, stirling engine or other external combustion cycles, thermophotovoltaics, thermoacoustics, fuel cells or turbine engines. The fuel used by this equipment will invariably be JP8 or diesel. Added value to any developed cogeneration approach would be realized by the system's ability to be combined with heat producing devices such as incinerators such that they could recover what is otherwise a large amount of wasted energy.",300,1995,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a cogeneration concept capable of producing 3-5 kW of electrical power and up 100 kW of heat. Demonstrate an entire system or critical subsystem that proves the feasibility of the approach. Demonstration of the system's ability to provide high efficiency (>75%) at a reasonably constant electrical output alongside variable heat output will be a critical factor in determining the success of Phase I. Ideal characteristics would be quiet operation (<65 dB at 1 meter), instantaneous power, and minimal weight (<500 lbs.) and cost (<$10k).",This phase will involve prototype design and fabrication for installation in an experimental mobile kitchen.,"DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: The recent deregulation of the electric power industry has provided an opportunity for consumers to reduce their energy costs through cogeneration. Small scale cogenerators could be coupled with residential heating systems to generate free electric power resulting in consumer cost savings and decreased dependence on municipal power grids. A successful cogeneration system could be used in millions of homes and businesses to decrease nationwide power consumption, environmental pollution and reduce problems associated with power grid failures. OPERATING AND SUPPORT COST (OSCR) REDUCTION: This topic supports Operating and Support Cost Reduction (OSCR). Lowering operating costs is the primary purpose of cogeneration (smaller foot print and quiet operation are secondary). In field kitchens the generator consumes as much fuel as the burner used to heat appliances. By generating electric power from the heat source, the cost of operating and maintaining a separate engine driven generator can be avoided, and overall fuel consumption can be cut by 30-50%.",1,"Pickard, D.W., Thermal Fluid Heat Transfer: Revolutionary Change in Field Kitchen Design, US Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Soldier Systems Center, NATICK/TP-99/053, June 99.; Hurley, J.R., Feasibility Study and Development of Modular Appliance Technologies, Centralized Heating (MATCH) Field Kitchen, US Army Natick RD&E Center, Technical Report Natick/TR-94/023, July 94.","Pickard, D.W., Thermal Fluid Heat Transfer: Revolutionary Change in Field Kitchen Design, US Army Soldier and Biological Chemical Command, Soldier Systems Center, NATICK/TP-99/053, June 99.; Hurley, J.R., Feasibility Study and Development of Modular Appliance Technologies, Centralized Heating (MATCH) Field Kitchen, US Army Natick RD&E Center, Technical Report Natick/TR-94/023, July 94.",2,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57103/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57103/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,00.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 09:50:24,,,,,A00-073_57103,DOD_SBIR_00_P1_C2_A00-073,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:05.400174+00

Added value could be realized by utilizing waste heat as the driving power input.,"Thermoacoustics is the management of heat energy using sound waves. The application of computers to finite-element flow analysis techniques has recently resulted in a greater understanding of how sound waves are effected by vessel shapes. This has allowed improvement of thermoacoustic systems, namely toward decreased size and increased efficiency thus rendering them strong challengers to the vapor compression systems typically used for refrigeration applications. Thermoacoustic refrigeration however does not rely on complex hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants or oils as working fluids and so avoids problems with EPA handling regulations and the increased training and maintenance technicalities of servicing high pressure sealed systems filled with controlled chemical substances Furthermore, with EPA regulations that have prohibited use of all chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) based refrigerants, we have seen a reduction in the efficiency and reliability of vapor compression systems using the alternative HFC compounds. This makes innovative refrigeration approaches all the more attractive. Because these devices contain only one moving part, their reliability is vastly superior to vapor compression, particularly in mobile applications that undergo severe vibration and shock. Another advantage of construction simplicity is curtailing of the parts procurement process and a decrease in tool inventory. Thermoacoustic refrigeration systems may be driven either electrically, or with heat. In the case of an electrically driven device, the power source may be 120-220 VAC and limited to output from common military generators. In the case of a heat driven version, the energy source could be an integral heat producing device such as a diesel burner, although some thought may be given to solar heating or utilizing waste heat from trash incineration or generator exhaust.",268,1879,1,No,No,No,,Develop a thermoacoustic device capable of providing enough cooling for a 40 cubic foot insulated container. The device's ability to utilize a minimum of electricity or waste heat energy will be a critical factor in determining success of Phase I.,This phase will involve packaging the device into a 40 cubic foot insulated food storage container and ensuring that it may be powered from field available sources. Performance evaluation of the prototype unit will be necessary to demonstrate concept viability.,"DUAL-USE APPLICATIONS: Thermoacoustic devices could be used anywhere refrigeration is required. Since they do not utilize hydrofluorocarbons and have only one moving part, they are strong competitors with the vapor compression systems commonly installed in billions of large and small refrigeration units worldwide. Their superior reliability and simplicity will save man-hours and logistical costs. OPERATING AND SUPPORT COST REDUCTION (OSCR): This topic supports Operating and Support Cost Reduction (OSCR). Lowering maintenance and fuel costs is the primary purpose of thermoacoustic refrigeration. The use of thermoacoustic refrigeration systems will eliminate need for the increased training requirements and maintenance technicalities of servicing high pressure vapor compression systems filled with controlled substances. Also avoided are the handling difficulties and procurement and disposal costs inherent to chemicals used in current refrigeration systems. Reliability of thermoacoustic systems is vastly superior to vapor compression, particularly in mobile applications that undergo severe vibration and shock. This increased reliability will reduce food loss costs and delayed meals. Their construction simplicity avoids parts procurement hurdles and decreases tool inventory. The efficiency of electrically powered thermoacoustic cycles will rival their vapor compression counterparts. In field situations where electricity is produced with inefficient diesel generators, heat driven thermoacoustic systems would excel. And, if the heat is provided with waste heat from other processes, the energy is free. At any rate, this potential will greatly decrease fuel consumption and therefore associated logistics.",1,"Pennsilvania State University: http://www.acs.psu.edu/thermoacoustics.html; Thermoacoustic links from Yahoo for additional information http://av.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Thermoacoustics&a=n; S.

Effects of RF and EM radiation can be mitigated through limiters and shielding. While there has been some research on new shielding technologies, significant improvements in limiter capabilities are required to reduce insertion losses, decrease turn-on time, reduce cost, and increase power handling capability. State-of-the-art front-end limiters fall into two categories: 1) very fast, high voltage limiters that are heavy and incompatible with solid state electronics and 2) very small, compact limiters that have limited power handling capabilities. Recent investigations into plasma limiters (Reference 1), fractal limiters, and other innovative front-end isolation techniques indicate the expectation that a new class of limiter can be developed having sub-nanosecond response times and that can reflect up to 10 kilowatts of RF power with very low insertion losses. These limiters are needed in the 10 MHz to 100 GHz frequency band, with primary emphasis in the 1 to 10 GHz region. It is unlikely that a single technology can effectively mitigate across this span of application, but solutions are desired that can mitigate RF effects over the broadest possible bands. While the primary focus of this effort is to protect radar front-end electronics, these limiter technologies will also be applicable to communications equipment and COTS electronics, such as computers. In addition to the limiter technology being sought, innovative RF shielding technologies that can protect from 100kHz to 100 GHz are also needed. Another area of research that has not been extensively investigated is the use of algorithms for mitigation of RF effects on system performance. Even with shielding and limiters, it is possible for some RF radiation to enter electronics. One method of ensuring that electronic systems function as required is to use a sense and respond algorithm that will monitor the performance of the operating electronics and then respond to anomalies generated by the RF interference. All mitigation techniques proposed must be applicable to Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) electronics. Because of the potential need to retrofit existing systems, the techniques must be low-cost and applicable to a wide variety of electronic systems.",363,2404,1,No,No,No,,"Analyze, design, and conduct proof-of-principle demonstrations of practical techniques to protect military electronics from high-power external RF emissions.",Develop prototype protection devices and conduct tests to evaluate the performance of protection devices and protected equipment in challenging RF environments.

Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and current state-of-the-art solid-state cameras on telescopes without f-stop control can use electronic shutters to compensate for changes of only three orders of magnitude in brightness. The closest available technology, LCD shutters, provides an insufficient range of transmission and does not adequately block near-infrared (NIR). Missile flight tests include events with large brightness changes. For example, reentry vehicles can brighten more than ten orders of magnitude in 20 seconds; a sensor configured to acquire high-altitude data will be badly saturated and exhibit artifacts at low altitudes. To supplement exposure-time control, a variable filter is needed which, on command, can rapidly change transmission over a range of at least four orders of magnitude. Transmission should change from one known value to another within one millisecond. It is convenient to have the available steps separated by no more than a factor of two in transmission. Transmission must be uniform over the field of view and should match in the visible and NIR bands. While high transmission of NIR is desired to increase sensitivity, the ability to eliminate NIR is essential to reduce artifacts. (i. e., from 400 thru 1200 nanometers).

TARDEC is currently interested in technologies that relate to situational awareness and path planning and in integrating these technologies into a modular UGV platform. Of particular interest for this application are modules for determining vehicle position and the content and geometry of the local area, as well as an internal map to keep track of their relationship. The vehicle position information would rely on sensors such as a Global Position System (GPS) or a pseudo-GPS, inertial guidance systems and other sensors to determine the vehicle's location and heading. The local scene content would be determined by a passive multiple video or thermal camera system combined with state-of-the-art image understanding software. The third piece of the system would be an internal map for path planning and navigation purposes. The map information would include the local terrain geometry, objects in the local area, along with the location and orientation of the vehicle. Additional features of interest would be the ability to employ the imaging system as a remote viewing and/or cueing device for manually estimating object locations and for target discrimination. A useful accessory would be a software module that would process visual or thermal sensor data and simulate different signature conditions for targets and backgrounds. This would aid in the testing and evaluation of the system under different conditions. It is envisioned that these systems would communicate with each other.

Integrating data mining algorithms with a text analysis system would enable cross-field terms'/phrases' counts and co-occurrence frequencies patterns analyses. Free text analysis would also be supported. For example, terms'/phrases' counts and co-occurrence frequency patterns within and across set windows (e.g., sentences, paragraphs, sections and documents) would be researched for logic grouping potential.

The final results of this effort should provide GI schema building tools which (accompanied by well-defined specification to model GI) will simplify the process of creating physical database schema that supports various GI domains of importance to the Army.,"Information communities have (or are in the process of developing) a multitude of domain specific geospatial data content standards (soils, vegetation, transporation, utilities, etc.). These data content standards are often just a domain's dictionary of feature-attribute-domain terms or a classification hierachy. Though these data content standards often have an implied data model associated with each, these are typically high-level conceptual models. These standards, if implemented in geospatial systems by their respective communities, will help support data interoperability between organizations and systems. However, for most GIS users it is not possible to implement these standards by creating a physical spatial database schema for commercial GIS software. The primary reason it is difficult to implement these standards is the lack of specificity on how to model this information in a geospatial database and the lack of robust, easy-to-use tools for the various commerical spatial database technologies. It is possible to create a physical geospatial schema for each of these database technologies without a logical model; however, this task requires considerable interaction between a knowledgeable domain expert and a spatial database administrator (and an extensive modeling effort.) (Often the expertise required for this task are not available.) Also, without a well-defined logical model, the physical models created from these data content standards will vary greatly between various implementations and therefore impede interoperability. What is needed is a well-defined specification for logically modelling GI that supports the most common commercial geospatial database technologies. This specification should serve as a template or framework to alter/enhance domain-specific GI data content standards with the necessary additional information. In additional, software tools will be needed to automate the process of creating physical schema for geospatial database from GI standards (using these enhanced, domain-specific, logical GI models.) SCOPE: The focus of this project will be to perform research which leads to the development of a viable specification to logically model GI and software tools to generate physical database schema from logical GI models. This research involves: 1) examining various existing and emerging GI spatial database technology; (i.e. geospatial database technology based upon CAD engines, relational database engines, newer object-relational spatial database technology, and the few based upon object databases technology); 2) developing a framework (or template) for logically modeling GI; 3) testing this GI model specification by enhancing domain-specific GI data content standards; 4) developing the necessary interface definition to support the straightforward implementation of these logical data models into common commercial GI database schema; 5) prototyping software tools to create physical database schemas (modelled after enhanced data content standards) for commercial GIS/geospatial database technology commonly used by the Army.",431,3105,1,No,No,No,,"Perform research, experimentation, and documentation of a specification for logically modeling GI (which includes data structure, semantics, and the development of an IDL model interface definition.)

Rapid movement and sustainment of troops depend upon the safe use of existing bridges to maximum capacity. To that end the bridge's Military Load Capacity (MLC) must be rapidly and accurately obtainable. A research program is currently underway at the U.S. Army Engineer, Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC) to develop a computer-automated analytical methodology for this purpose, based upon the analytical procedures from FM5-446. These analytical methods are highly effective for most bridge types. However, in the case of reinforced or pre-stressed concrete bridges for which the internal steel reinforcement is unknown, they can only provide overly conservative, low accuracy MLC ratings. This problem became readily apparent during recent operations in the Balkans, where most of the bridges were of reinforced concrete and no steel reinforcing details were available. Conservative estimates of the internal reinforcement were necessary, resulting in possibly overly conservative MLC ratings that needlessly limited troop mobility. For this problem, a nondestructive technology is required to ""look inside"" the concrete and map the internal steel reinforcement. Some technologies, such as magnetic-based pachometers are currently available for this purpose. However, they are very limited in capability, especially for the typical example of multiple, deeply buried reinforcing. An ultrasonic technique known as computed tomography (CT) appears to offer a better solution to this problem. Tomography is currently being used for such purposes as imaging body parts in the medical field using both CT from X-rays and ultrasonics and from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and for seismic imaging of the earth. In the case of bridge girders, ultrasonic shots will be made in a wide variety of angles around the base and both sides of the girder and an overdetermined system of linear equations will be solved in real time to resolve the properties of the cross-sectional area of the girder plotted in the form of pixels. With some work, it is believed that ultrasonic tomography can be adapted for use in a military field environment for the location and definition of internal steel reinforcement. The system will be portable and user-friendly for battlefield diagnostics. The system will provide a tomogram of the cross-sectional profile of the girder. From that tomogram the number of steel bars, the size of the steel bars, and their position can be accurately determined and fed as input data into the computer-automated methodology mentioned above to aid in the determination of the MLC. Tomographic measurements require thousands of readings. In general, the final image resolution is related to the number of measurements and the coverage of those measurements. Because it is impractical to manually position the transducers for these thousands of readings, a scanning system is needed. Examples of potential technologies that might allow for practical data collection include wheel transducers, fixed arrays, and electromechanical drives.",481,3181,1,No,No,No,,"Determine feasibility of system and document plans for further development of hardware and software.

ERDC can assist the proposer in the aspects of the ultrasonic measurements in concrete and with the field system but would expect the proposer to have significant expertise on their knowledge of inversion algorithms and their modification.","Further screen existing inversion algorithms and refine the final inversion software to optimize the image. Provide to the computer code any a priori information about the bridge girder. For example, the concrete properties will normally be uniform and the ultrasonic velocity will lie in a narrow range. The shape of the steel is roughly circular and its velocity also lies in a narrow range. Other a priori information may be possible.

These measurements would then be used for either: (1) predicting pavement performance under known sustained traffic or (2) classifying the pavement's structural capacity in terms of a numeric parameter, such as a military load classification (MLC) number.","Predicting the performance of a roadway over time, given traffic and environmental conditions, is an extremely complex problem. Military personnel confront this problem on a regular basis, whenever vehicles are used to move personnel or equipment. If military operations are on foreign soil, the complexity of the problem is increased by lack of knowledge concerning foundation soil, pavement material characteristics, and pavement structural thicknesses. When operating near unfriendly territory, the problem can be further complicated by lack of time and the need to keep equipment light and portable. Surface deflections can provide important information concerning the structural capacity of a roadway, and thus improve the accuracy of performance predictions (1-3). Pavement engineers commonly use nondestructive testing (NDT) equipment, such as the falling-weight deflectometer, to measure these surface deflections. These data enable engineers to predict pavement structural characteristics, such as pavement layer stiffnesses (4). These current systems, however, are not easily transported to remote locations and their usefulness is limited by the fact that the loads are imposed by the impact of a falling mass, rather than by rolling vehicle wheels. Advanced NDT equipment, such as the rolling wheel deflectometer, are under development, but these devices have shown limited success and they may never offer the portability needed for military operations. To characterize the structural capacity of a pavement section within a transportation route, surface deflections would only have to be measured under one or two critical vehicles among all the vehicles in transport. The critical vehicles would be those which impose relatively high axle loads. The two critical vehicles may differ in terms of axle configurations and/or tire pressures. Once deflections are measured under these critical vehicles, structural pavement models can predict deflections under other vehicles and thus, predict the cumulative damage imposed on a pavement by a suite of vehicle types. To ensure that the deflection measurements provide sufficient information for accurate predictions of pavement performance, the following requirements must be met. The equipment must enable the user to evaluate deflections in a single wheelpath over a roadway length of at least 4m, with individual deflection measurements spaced no more than 200 mm in the direction of travel. Measured deflections will be accurate to within 20 microns. The equipment will be able to track the position of the vehicle wheel during deflection testing. The software to be developed must provide the ability for the user to control the rate of data sampling. Data will be stored in a format that is both easy to interpret and transportable. The user will be able to view any individual deflection basin (captured at an instant in time) on a portable computer screen, along with the original pavement surface and the position of the loading wheel. The user will also be able to view deflection basins in sequence, at a user-defined rate of change. This capability will facilitate interpretation of the dynamic aspects of the problem. To ensure that the deflection measurement system is practical, it must be portable (without a trailer) and it must require no more than two hours for each test, including set-up time and execution. This time requirement is necessary because the military must be able to perform several tests in a single day. A single transportation route can require many tests because roadways are inherently variable along their lengths in terms of both internal structure and surrounding terrain.",560,3674,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct feasibility investigation, select the most appropriate technology, and prepare a preliminary hardware design.

This must be achieved without resulting in undesirable changes in groundwater parameters (nitrate, TOC, etc.) or clogging of the sediment due to biomass growth.","In this phase, the goal will be to demonstrate the scale-up and efficacy of the technology at pilot scale at a DoD site with the goal of developing operational data, treatment efficiency, optimization information, and a preliminary cost analysis for full-scale applications. Based on positive results obtained during the proposed research, field demonstrations and evaluation of in situ bioaugmentation, and in situ biostimulation technology may be pursued. Special emphasis will be given to determining to what extent bioaugmentation reduces start-up time, increases contaminant removal efficiencies, and ultimately reduces the overall clean-up costs.","A full-scale site would be selected for demonstration and commercial use of the technology. Such a site could be a DoD site or a privately owned facility, and could include treatment of ground water where no previous remediation had been implemented or used to accelerate the closure of an existing pump & treat system.",1,"Bricka, R., and W.

Formulate the necessary gun barrel design criteria to achieve weight reduction without sacrificing gun barrel performance with respect to firing rate schedule and wear/erosion resistance. Define an appropriate affordable manufacturing methodology whereby the candidate lightweight materials are introduced into the gun barrel fabrication process.,"Materials research and development in recent years has focused on lightweight materials ( aluminum, titanium alloys, intermetallics, organic or metal matrix composites, ceramics and ceramic matrix composite(CMC)) in order to serve the needs of product developments in the industrial marketplace. Various governmental agencies have also spearheaded monolithic and composite materials developments to meet the ever expanding performance requirements of major hardware programs. Gun barrels have not taken potential advantage of the property improvements achieved in many of these programs. The intent of this solicitation is to incorporate these new materials into innovative gun barrel designs in an appropriate manner so as to achieve weight reduction without loss of operational performance. The focus will be on two gun barrel calibers. One is the small caliber (7.62mm) infantry gun barrel where the benefit of a lighter gun barrel would have maximum impact on logistics and soldier endurance. The other caliber is the 20mm ( bore) gun barrel in a three barrel gatling system for the Comanche helicopters. A substantial weight reduction here would have significant impact on increasing round or fuel load. The operational performance of the gun barrel will act as design constraints with respect to the degree to which a weight reduction can be achieved with the proposed innovative concept. One constraint is that the bore surface temperature can reach a value of 1875 degrees Centigrade (the melting point of chromium) with an unrestrained firing schedule. Another constraint is that propellant gas pressures of 50ksi can be reached in the gun barrel during the 3-5 millisecond pressure pulse that occurs with each round fired. With respect to the wear/erosion aspects of the gun barrel, another constraint is that the material exposed to the propellant gases must exhibit sufficient high temperature chemical wear and mechanical creep resistance to survive chemical erosion and rifling wear. Furthermore both the calibers under consideration have traditional land/groove rifling to impart spin to the exiting round. Candidate gun barrel designs must also impart spin to the rounds.",331,2187,1,No,No,No,,"Propose and develop an overall gun barrel design architecture that incorporates lightweight materials.

The prototype design will be subjected to interior hydraulic pressures of 50ksi at both room and elevated temperatures( 500 degrees Centigrade) as well mechanically tested for comparison with gun steel properties. Submit design analyses to indicate that the prototype test cylinder provided will withstand these tests.",Develop the gun barrel design to a maturity sufficient to satisfy weight reduction achievements without sacrificing present barrel performance. Fabricate three test barrels for evaluation at ARDEC. Delineate the gun barrel fabrication process and how the lightweight material is incorporated. Expand the design concept to provide for enhanced wear resistance without the use of chromium plated bore surfaces. Conduct modeling analyses to validate both enhanced wear resistance and weight reduction under typical firing schedules. Fabricate three gun barrels of this advanced design for ballistic evaluation at ARDEC.,This program will have potential utility in commercial high performance engines where both lightweight and wear abatement features would contribute to enhanced performance. The design modality developed here for a lightweight gun barrel will also have further usefulness in future military hardware acquisitions. OPERATING AND SUPPORT COST (OSCR) REDUCTION: Increasing the barrel wear life as well as reducing barrel weight contributes to tangible savings by reducing materiel logistic resupply and maintenance manpower requirements.

Neither device type can be easily operated within a moving combat vehicle. Speech recognition has made great strides in the past few years in terms of noise robustness and language processing, and is slowly gaining acceptance as a keyboard replacement. What is now needed is a mouse and trackball replacement, such as an eye-tracker or some form of neuromuscular sensing device, that can be operated accurately in a moving vehicle so the operator will be able to navigate through menus or select items on a computer screen without needing great dexterity or luck.

Decision aids software shall be used as the demonstration platform, and all operations should be smoothly executed without utilizing a keyboard, mouse, or track ball. Contractor shall provide a fully integrated prototype, all required software to interface to external computers, complete documentation, source code, and a full development environment.","AND DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Most computer programs require both keyboard data entry and point-and-click operations with a mouse or trackball device to operate efficiently. In an office this is fine. In a moving environment such as an airplane, car, bus, or armored vehicle, point and click operations become more difficult. Speech recognition can replace tedious data entry, and with domain specific grammar corrections it can ensure spoken data and dictation are recognized and entered properly. Adding a secondary device to complement speech input, which could perform all the point-and-click operations efficiently and require no steady hand movements, would permit full use of a computer in moving vehicles. Just as this combination would be helpful for the military in controlling combat simulations and interact with command and control consoles, it would also make a useful commercial gaming device for people so inclined. It would also afford many individuals, who are handicapped and cannot effectively use a mouse, trackball, or keyboard, the opportunity to access the next generation internet, and enjoy all the benefits of today's modern computers. OPERATING AND SUPPORT COST REDUCTION: Data and text entry request for analysis, and acceptance or rejection of results are tasks ideally suited to control by speech. These tasks are usually completed by typing at a keyboard, but they are now also being done by voice interface. Point-and-click operations however, such as maneuvering through menus, designating a point on a displayed map, or pressing a button on a computer's GUI can dominate system operations in a command and control environment. Utilizing speech for these operations is inefficient and has consistently failed in it's acceptance. The mouse or trackball is ideally suited to these PAC operations, but since they require a steady workspace, their operation within a moving combat vehicle is difficult. By developing a usable PAC device for this environment, and coupling it with text and data input by voice, the operator will be able to naturally control all computerized operations, and thereby improve efficiency, reduce support personnel, and minimize training costs.",1,"Nielsen J, ""Noncommand User Interfaces"", Communications of the ACM 36, 4, April 1993, 83-99; Spoken Human-Machine Dialog Workshop, Report, Army Research Office, Research Triangle Park, NC, 30 May-1 June 1995.; ""Thoughts into Actions"", Bergen Record Online, April 28, 1998; ""Training the Disabled to lift an Eyebrow and Open Worlds"", New York Times, May 17, 1998","Nielsen J, ""Noncommand User Interfaces"", Communications of the ACM 36, 4, April 1993, 83-99; Spoken Human-Machine Dialog Workshop, Report, Army Research Office, Research Triangle Park, NC, 30 May-1 June 1995.; ""Thoughts into Actions"", Bergen Record Online, April 28, 1998; ""Training the Disabled to lift an Eyebrow and Open Worlds"", New York Times, May 17, 1998",4,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57062/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/57062/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,00.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 09:50:31,,,,,A00-093_57062,DOD_SBIR_00_P1_C2_A00-093,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:05.400174+00

Cost effective methods are needed for developing/enhancing decision making and leadership skills of small unit (platoon, squad, and team) leaders in urban operations. One solution is to conduct a portion of this training, such as mission rehearsals, in virtual environments through the use of individual combatant simulators. Preliminary work in this area has shown that virtual environments offer soldiers the opportunity to thoroughly rehearse missions and familiarize themselves with the procedural aspects of specific tasks as well as offering a chance to examine new tactics and techniques. To date, prototype virtual training scenarios developed for urban operations have not systematically emphasized the cognitive aspects of decision making used by junior leaders or the adequacy of these decisions. These leaders require exposure to the cognitive challenges in these environments and practice handling these challenges including recognizing environmental cues and relevant situational factors affecting the decision. A scenario-based instructional program is needed which allows trainers to focus on critical decisions and judgments made by the soldier or small unit leader in conducting urban missions. The program will allow trainers to focus on specific decision points in the scenarios and address specific cues, factors, and strategies and highlight what the soldiers did right and where they went wrong. Performance measures are also needed that will document improvements in decision making over time.",245,1695,1,No,No,No,,"Scenarios will be developed by the trainer and key decision points identified. Each decision will have multiple responses (typically four), also identified in advance by the trainer. Decision points can include environmental cues the soldier needs to notice and interpret and/or tactical factors that must be taken into account when making decisions (also established by the trainer). The objective of this phase is to develop a methodology for an automated data collection and feedback system. The system will allow the trainer to input response alternatives into a data base during the course of the scenario and is capable of tracking the soldier's behaviors, decisions and judgments at these critical (pre-determined) points in the scenarios. The system will permit rapid replay of events at these critical points. In addition, the system will track mission related factors such as rounds fired, casualties, time to complete the mission, soldier movement patterns, etc. and provide relevant summary statistics in a tabular or graphical format following the completion of each scenario. This procedure will also be able to link these factors with the soldier's decisions or behaviors at pre-determined points. To supplement the feedback process, a top-down, snap shot capability depicting the positioning of soldiers in relation to the terrain at specified points in time (determined by the trainer) will be provided. The system should be capable of supporting a PC-based Lennux Red Hot operating system and should be applicable to HLA simulation networks.",This phase will include the development and application of a prototype automated data collection and feedback system with the tracking and feedback capabilities described above. It will also include the development of prototype instruments for observers to assess both operational performance and qualitative changes in soldier decision making over time. The procedure will be validated using soldiers who will execute scenarios stressing different decision skill areas. The contractor will produce reports documenting the methodology and validation research.,"This phase includes tailoring the decision-making training approach, assessment procedures, and instruments to other military and commercial markets. There is a potential commercial market for virtual environment training for enhancing rapid decision-making in high risk urban situations such as police actions, emergency medical treatments, and fire fighting. There also may be some applicability for sports where skilled team positions, e.g., quarterback, require rapid decisions, judgments and assessments of various situational cues under high stress conditions. OPERATING AND SUPPORT COST (OSCR) REDUCTION: Conducting the appropriate decision skills training at existing real world urban training sites requires extensive exposure to the many cognitive demands facing soldiers in urban operations. This type of training will severely stress available unit resources. A virtual environment, scenario-based instructional program with enhanced data collection/feedback features will provide the requisite knowledge-based training in a cost effective manner.",1,"Pleban, R.
