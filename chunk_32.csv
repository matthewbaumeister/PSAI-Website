Typically, fuels and chlorinated solvents lie on the top (LNAPL) or bottom (DNAPL) of an aquifer and slowly diffuse into groundwater, creating a long-term source of contamination. Currently there is no technology specifically aimed at detecting or monitoring the bulk fuel or solvent material that floats or sinks within the subsurface, in contact with the aquifer. Also, existing characterization/monitoring methods are labor intensive, complex, costly, and may produce invalid and unreliable results. This research will develop a system which characterizes and images LNAPL and DNAPL waste, and other objects within the subsurface. The use of geophysical techniques integrated with the cone penetrometer have potential for meeting this requirement. The proposed system may use pulsed seismic or electromagnetic sources to probe the subsurface. Subsurface radiators associated with the cone penetrometer will direct a seismic or electromagnetic pulse into the earth; and other subsurface receivers emplaced by a cone penetrometer will detect the transmitted pulses. Computer analysis of the detected signals will define the extent and type of underground deposits. An image will be produced through the computation of a pointwise soil dispersion curve (the dielectric constant and conductivity as a function of frequency). Development of such a system will accelerate environmental surveillance and waste location, and greatly reduce the number of soil samples needed to reliably detect contamination. By identifying the source of contamination, remediation efforts will be better targeted, allowing more efficient and cost-effective cleanup of these difficult sites. Cost savings to the Government could easily be millions of dollars annually. Phase I: Phase I is expected to address Air Force requirements to develop technologies to characterize sites contaminated with fuels and solvents consistent with the tri-service roles and responsibilities established under Project Reliance. Phase II: Due to the magnitude and urgency of these requirements, normal scope and funding limitations do not apply. Dual Use Commercialization Potential: There is a significant commercial market for such a system as this will be a dual-use technology. The DoD uses contractors to conduct remediation at thousands of contaminated sites, as do the DoE and EPA. There is also a large number of contaminated sites created by industry, not associated with activities of any department or agency of the federal government, which will require remediation.",393,2686,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62856/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62856/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,94.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:34:50,,,,,AF94-251_62856,DOD_SBIR_94_P1_C2_AF94-251,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:18.109444+00

Specific examples include intelligent management of all targeting information; increased target detection range using advanced tracking/processing techniques; long-range all-aspect target recognition/identification; automated target cuing; adaptive processing techniques for operation in presence of clutter and electronic warfare environment; advanced affordable sensor designs for passive and active sensors; weapon and sensor integration (including opto-electronic); combined active and passive systems; wind profiling techniques, spectrometry, and pattern based machine learning. b) New and innovative approaches to a wide range of electronics and electron device disciplines including nanoelectronic structures, component packaging interconnection, and advanced design techniques are requested. New device concepts and feasibility demonstration efforts are sought for high frequency RF signal amplification; logic and electronic processing; ultra-high speed digital switching devices; advanced semiconductor fabrication technology; high speed/density integrated circuit packaging and high-level integration techniques; and computer based tools for microelectronic design. c) The need exists for conceptual and mathematical methods and models to quantitatively define the sensitivities, benefits and costs of potential new airframe technologies for aircraft of the next century. The models must represent at least the minimum amount of detail to assess the effects of aircraft configuration, observables, materials, structural concepts, airframe-propulsion integration and manufacturing processes on performance, mission-effectiveness, strength, stiffness and life. They must be consistent with existing multidisciplinary computer software such as Air Force Structures Optimization System (ASTROS) or the Multidisciplinary Analysis and Design Industry Consortium (MADIC). d) Aerospace materials are increasingly critical to the success of modern weapon systems. The requirements placed upon these materials are stringent, necessitating sophisticated control of structures and properties. New approaches are needed to process these materials for use in military and non-military applications. Examples are closed-loop feedback-based control, including sensors; simulation and modeling; advanced deposition techniques; in-process inspection; and control strategies. e) New and innovative techniques for high-speed image processing are sought in diverse areas such as ultra-high-speed computation and mass storage, mathematical image processing techniques, image compression, high-resolution displays, and algorithm development. Technologies for image processing should address throughout, size, programmability, and cost. Techniques may encompass a broad spectrum of sensor outputs such as electro-optic, infrared, passive/active millimeter wave, radio frequency, and ultrasound. Both military and commercial payoff in areas such as advanced guidance, surveillance, robotics, medical imaging and telemedicine, and remote sensing are expected. f) Batteries are used everywhere in Air Force ground and air systems, and throughout the civilian sector. Many of them pose problems in manufacturing (mercury and nickel-cadmium, for example) and disposal. Recycling acids, heavy metals, and reactive materials is very expensive and promises to get worse.

The heat may be either inherent within the ambient environment, such as an engine, or generated by the power loads of the integrated circuits. Commercial applications can also be envisioned in aircraft and automotive applications. Current IC devices are limited in their response to approximately 125o C. To operate beyond this temperature necessitates the use of external cooling devices which impose a bulk and weight penalty that increases with increasing operating temperature at the cost of overall reliability. Research is currently underway to extend the temperature response capabilities of GaAs IC devices to 300-3500 C with high signal speed, and SiC IC devices to 650-7000 C with high power load. The objective of this program is to develop the electronic packaging and interconnect materials technology base to incorporate these IC's into advanced electronic devices, with emphasis on materials requirements for advanced multi-chip, multi-layer design concepts with corresponding operating temperature capability. Materials problems associated with continuous operation at high temperatures and temperature cycling must be addressed, including temperature effects on conductivity/dielectric properties; electrochemical, thermochemical, and thermomechanical stability; thermal conductivity; and interface chemistry and coefficient of thermal mismatch between dissimilar materials. For electronic systems with 300-3500 C operational capability, the types of materials considered should include thin layer polymeric dielectrics for optimization of size and weight. For electronic systems with 650-7000 C operational capability, thermooxidative constraints limit the dielectric materials to ceramics. Novel concept are sought for each temperature range, such as circuitry using conductive polymers related chemically to polymeric dielectric layers or circuitry using conductive ceramics similar in composition to ceramic dielectric layers.

Maximum integration of the above, or other advanced devices will not only increase circuit speed, but also allow more sophisticated trigger circuitry, reduced die size and simplified packaging. Indeed, if inputs are optical signals, no high-bandwidth electrical connections would be required, allowing a system to achieve up to the full 200-GHz bandwidth noted above.

Local water boards, at the direction of the federal law (Title 40 Code of Federal Register 403.5 (C)(1), available in any law library), have established limits for how much mercury can be present in waste water entering the public sewer system. Since dental amalgam is approximately 50 percent mercury by weight, it is the source of mercury found in the waste water leaving dental clinics and entering the public sewer system. Many local water boards have established very low limits, typically 50 parts per billion (ppb)of mercury (Norfolk, Virginia), for waste water entering the public sewer system. Unless reliable technology can be developed to remove the dental amalgam from waste water, it will have to be collected and disposed of as hazardous waste. If virtually all the dental amalgam and hence the mercury can be removed from waste water leaving dental clinics, the recovered dental amalgam could be recycled and the rest of the waste water returned to the public sewer system. This would not only avoid generation of a hazardous waste but also permit recycling of the silver and mercury found in the recovered dental amalgam. Existing technology based on centrifuges or sedimentation do not remove sufficient amalgam to meet most local limits.

Basic noninvasive technologies (oxygen dosimetry, Marquette TRAM monitor) currently exist and provide physicians with clinical data, via monitors/pads attached to the skin, such as the percent oxygen saturation of red blood cells and heart, EKG, and respiratory rate. These data are clinically important in determining patient status but more useful information is needed, particularly in patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO). For HBO patients, oxygen saturation is unimportant because of the elevated levels of dissolved oxygen in body fluids - red cell saturation is maximized and becomes irrelevant data. A device is needed that measures clinical parameters without touching the subject. It should be technologically inclined to provide a variety of clinical data. There is a need for a noninvasive probe that may be placed near, but not on, the patient or the patient's wound, to measure the partial pressure of dissolved oxygen in the interstitial body fluids. It should be capable of assessing gas pressure levels in a graduated fashion from superficial to deep, in both healthy and compromised tissues. Other relevant gases, such as CO2 and CO, should be measured because they are also clinically important in certain patients, i.e., CO poisoning. Additionally, blood and deep tissue pH, degree of tissue granulation, and degree of eschar thickening are useful data to measure and use in conjunction with the blood/tissue gas levels.

Using this simulation technique, research can be conducted prior to building specific designs to check the efficacy of a specific design. These checks are commonly done by building and testing prototype structures in a wind tunnel. It is far less expensive to change simulation parameters and conduct simulation modeling than to run a full prototype test program. The simulation helps weed out undesirable prototyping scenarios before valuable time and other resources are used up with poor prototype evaluations.",,0,"Repperger, D.W., 1992, ""A Study of Supermaneuverable Flight Trajectories Through Motion Field Simulation of a Centirfuge Simulator"", Trans. of the A.S.M.E.

A full-color helmet display can aid information integration significantly through color coding. Subtractive-color liquid-crystal displays (SCLCDs) produce full color without sacrificing resolution and, therefore, can provide the pilot with an all-in-one display system capable of acting as an appropriate information source for any conceivable input. However, SCLCDs have a limitation that greatly complicates the design of the helmet display optics: each of the three color primaries is generated in a different image plane. It is difficult enough to achieve lightweight helmet display optics that provide good chromatic aberration performance over the entire 360-830-nm visible spectrum when all primaries emit from the same plane. The problem becomes more difficult when the primaries are formed in image planes that are displaced slightly in a longitudinal direction from each other.

The Air Force has performed ejection compatibility tests on several HMDs as part of the air worthiness certification process. The HMD was subjected to wind blasts simulating ejections up to 600 knots. Preliminary data show that helmet shape is an important factor in determining the direction and amount of force exerted on the helmet (and presumably on the pilot's neck). Furthermore, the airflow pattern around the ejection seat reveals any disruption that may interfere with the pitot tube airspeed sensing mechanism and prevent proper deployment of the parachute. However, wind blast testing requires the building of costly hardware prototypes and the availability of expensive wind tunnel and/or wind blast facilities (upwards of $80K to $100K per helmet configuration run). This effort will use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and visualization techniques to create a virtual wind tunnel/wind blast environment so that flawed HMD designs can be corrected without the expense of actual hardware building and testing. Another possible usage of this virtual environment is to aid the design of frangible HMD as a means to meet safe weight/CG requirements. The trajectory of a breakaway is not always known or predictable to the designer. This modeling tool will enable the designers to examine the effects of different disengagement latches and timing combinations to insure maximum pilot safety and compatibility with the entire escape sequence.

PHASE II: Phase II will involve test, refinement, and validation of the methods and indices. It will result in a report and the development of a computerized trainee assessment and training efficiency and effectiveness measurement system. Further, it will assess trainee skill acquisition, retention, and decay, for selected training programs and systems. Proposals should assume that the technology will run on an 80486, or better, environment. c. Research is needed to transition of a diverse array of emerging learning domain knowledge from research laboratories into more applied settings. Current generation microprocessors offer powerful delivery platforms at reasonable expense. The challenge remains, to scale up from ""toy"" laboratory instructional domains to fully-developed real-world instructional domains. PHASE I: Phase I will implement brief, proof-of-principle automated instructional systems in Air Force domains, based on instructional strategies validated through rigorous pedagogical research. These systems could include part-task trainers, intelligent tutor authoring systems, digital video interactive, hypermedia, and multimedia environments. PHASE II: Phase II would expand this prototype to a full-scale instructional system, thus producing fully-realized automated curricula in instructional domains of interest to the Air Force but applicable to DoD, industry, and education. d. Research is needed for instructional development/delivery technologies that maximize student involvement, increase learning, and decrease time-under-instruction, regardless of student/teacher location. PHASE I: Phase I will result in technical specifications and proof-of-concept demonstrations concerning integration of Affected Domain into the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) process, voice recognition/synthesis in computer-based training and microprocessor-based multimedia distance learning. PHASE II: Phase II will result in validated prototypes. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: Recent trends in technology development have increased, rather than decreased, the complexity of operating and maintaining systems. The Department of Labor's Work Force 2000 studies have documented the increasing complexity trend where jobs of the 21st Century will require increasing scientific literacy or professional technical skills. At the same time the basic skills of those entering the work force are actually declining. Further, those entering the work force will have dynamic jobs which will keep them always in a training mode to stay abreast of changes in existing jobs or retraining into jobs created by new technologies. The result is that DoD, government, industry, public and private education, and academia must have new technologies to make the increasing education and training burden more effective and less costly. Increasing portions of government and industry budgets are going to training and there is a public outcry for education to reverse the falling test scores and provide students with fundamental skills necessary to be effective in today's world. America 2000 and similar academia initiatives are not showing the required improvements. Public and private markets abound for viable intelligent courseware development and delivery systems. Course authoring systems for developing affordable intelligent computer based instruction systems, interactive multimedia distance learning technology, and training utility assessment technologies which incorporate state-of-the-art outcomes of laboratory learning research have the customers waiting -- now we need the products to satisfy the need.",,0,"d.

Research is required to understand and model the visual effects of laser radiation on the human eye under various conditions. New technologies may be applied to the development of two separate improved devices; a high-brightness, high-fidelity, vision stimulator and a retina tracking and stabilization device, to research the effects of laser radiation. a. Because of the inability to do live-fire tests of lasers against personnel in the field, man-in-the-loop simulations of the effect of lasers in military operations is desired. Presently, indoor laboratory experiments are limited by the relatively low brightness and resolution of television and VGA images. Similarly, simulations have inherent limitations because of the display devices. A visual display with brightness better than high-definition television (HDTV) and resolution and frame rate equal to or better than HDTV is required.",150,1005,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will result in the identification of candidate technologies and development of a preliminary design for a high- brightness, high-fidelity vision stimulator. Initially a monochrome display would be acceptable.","Phase II will result in formalization of the design and construction of a prototype vision stimulator. b. Presently, research is ongoing at Armstrong Laboratory to determine minimum visible lesion thresholds which requires the accurate placement of laser radiation in a grid on the retina. Clinicians also need to accurately deliver laser radiation to precise retinal locations to treat retinal pathology. Currently researchers and clinicians deliver laser radiation to the retina by stabilizing the eye through anesthetization or requiring prolonged fixation by the subject. There is a need to accurately place laser radiation in a grid on the retina without excessive anesthetization or eye fatigue. Research is required to identify technologies which will allow the tracking of the retina with eye movements. The tracking should be updated at regular intervals so that a real-time position of a small area (nominally 100 micrometers diameter) of the retina can be tracked. PHASE I: Phase I will result in the determination of feasibility, technical design and proof-of-concept for the retinal tracking device. PHASE II: Phase II will develop an apparatus which would track a mammalian retina in real-time as the eye moves. This apparatus will be able to control connecting optical components which would aid in the delivery of visible radiation to the retina. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: The vision stimulator could be the front end of Distributed Interactive Simulations (DIS) and flight simulators. It could also be used in research experiments on vision function. Other uses include high- definition TV, virtual reality, cockpit displays, commercial aviation, low vision aids, and computer terminals. The retina tracking and stabilization device could be used for thousands of clinical ophthalmic retinal laser treatments which are done annually by government and industry.",,0,"Special Issue on HDTV broadcasting.

Presently available fiber optic links are limited by very high link loss which limits their performance in applications including antenna remoting and optical control of phased array antennas. These links have been excluded from several military and commercial applications because of high link loss. The major contributions to this loss at microwave frequencies are poor laser electrical-to-optical conversion and impedance mismatch at the signal input to the laser diode. Since laser manufacturers have concentrated on developing high speed lasers without regard to the conversion efficiency, new laser structures designed for high efficiency will be required. The second major loss contribution is the impedance mismatch at the signal input to the laser. In order to match the 50 ohm impedance line to the laser which has a low impedance, typically a few ohms, a large series resistor is usually connected to the laser. Consequently the microwave power delivered to the laser is a small fraction of the drive power resulting in a power loss of 10 to 15dB.

Expected performance will vary from high gain, multi-element arrays to low gain, multiple function single elements. Sensor systems will operate in multiple bands within the full microwave spectrum.

These new capabilities include: smart control for array antennas that can sense failures and correct or compensate antenna patterns, super-resolution and neural network techniques that can perform accurate direction finding with smaller systems using less accurate, lower cost components, automatic system calibration based upon the use of available beacons, and adaptive cancellation of interference for mobile satellite terminals. These capabilities allow the use of small, low cost radar and communication sensors with increased capability due to the flexibility of adaptive digital smart control. Since most of this flexibility will be implemented by and under computer control, the development of low-cost, digital beamformer modules containing all components from radiating element to A/D converter is key to this initiative.

Proposals will be evaluated on the extent that they meet each of these requirements. Most of the current optically flat (lambda/10), high contrast (100:1) Spatial Light Modulators are limited to binary outputs and rudimentary functionality on a pixel by pixel basis. Although useful for signal processing devices (e.g. correlators) they have overall limited performance due to the restriction in dynamic range. The addition of multiple levels significantly improves the performance when the signals are embedded in clutter noise. In addition, recent research has shown enhancement can also be achieved using relatively simple local operators such as 1/f filtering in the Fourier plane or 2-d image demultiplexing. The simplest approach to providing both local functionality and multiple levels is to fabricate super pixels containing both gray level modulators (i.e. polarization rotation) and simple circuitry with photodetector control. To separate input, readout and control beams, lenslet arrays can be used. However, commercially available lenslet arrays do not preserve wavefront flatness. The first objective is therefore to design a modulator that has the ability of generating multiple levels, either phase or amplitude (minimum of 8 levels). The second objective, is to design a method for optically addressing each pixel with multiple signal and control beams. For example, an improved lens array could be integrated onto the device or a holographic correction plate could be applied to an existing commercial array or a flip chip technique could be used with modulators on the back side. Such an integrated opto-electronic focal plane processing chip would significantly advance the state of the art in optical processing (correlators) and also optical computing and can be realized by combining existing technologies, specifically, OASLM's, VLSI and microlens array technology.",315,2116,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate the feasibility of the idea by fabricating at least 1, multi-level device (minimum eight levels).

GaN, AlN, and InN form a continuous alloy system which can emit optical radiation spanning the range of wavelengths from the red to the ultraviolet. One of the major obstacles to research on III-V Nitrides is the lack of a suitable single crystal substrate material that is lattice matched and thermally compatible with GaN. At present GaN, AlN, and InN are grown primarily on sapphire or silicon wafers because of their commercial availability, but SiC, GaP, GaAs, ZnO, and MgO are also prospective candidates for use. All of these materials have drawbacks for growth of epitaxial layers of III-V Nitrides. The problem is that the atomic spacing of the substrate must equal that of GaN for lattice matching. Furthermore, the substrate crystal structure must be cubic to provide a template for growth of cubic GaN. Finally, the coefficients of thermal expansion of substrate and epilayer must be equal in order to avoid dislocations and stress-cracking upon cool-down. Since none of the available substrates meet these criteria, this effort will be focused on developing suitable substrate materials including bulk GaN, InN, or AlN.

The potential of light-wave speed and ultra high bandwidth have driven the scientific community to research and develop a host of discrete optical and electronic components that appear to meet the high performance system challenge. In particular, discrete GaAs and InP optoelectronic devices have shown dramatic improvements, yet, little has been accomplished regarding integration of these components into fully functional O-E circuits that can be utilized by circuit designers. For example, high performance discretes are often fabricated using sophisticated epitaxial growth techniques. Often, however, the layer structure and growth methodology for different components are mutually exclusive or result in non planar surfaces which leads to tedious processing and low yield with expensive manufacturing prospects not to mention poor performance. This and other process issues preclude the fabrication of high complexity OEICs. The full potential of photonic communication and target acquisition cannot be reached until a technology base uniquely targeted at the OEIC integration challenge is established.

Microelectronic manufacturers have resorted to multi-layer metallizations to accommodate miniaturization and multi-level interconnect schemes. A natural result of this layering is an increase in residual stresses due to the processing of dissimilar materials at different temperatures. The technical challenge is to devise a dynamic system which can be easily used to measure residual stresses after processing and during testing. Present systems such as the rotating anode X-ray technique require special training and equipment not readily accessible to a process engineer. The accessibility of a simple tool would encourage more companies to evaluate product after deposition rather than at the end of the production cycle with the most value added.

Such a technique would allow in-process monitoring of metallizations for high stress development. In the best instance, wafers with stressed metallizations could be detected early enough in the process to permit reworking. The worse case scenario would be that no more value would be added to the wafers cutting losses by scrapping.

Also, with growing complexity and density of transistors on a chip, the natural trend is for power to increase. Many techniques and methodologies have been developed for analyzing and/or reducing the power dissipation of an integrated circuit (refs. 1-6). Unfortunately, these techniques and methodologies have not found widespread usage because of the lack of automated tools that employ them. Current synthesis tools that are used for today's integrated circuit designs may be used to optimize the design for either performance or area. But as circuits are optimized for performance and/or area, power dissipation for a densely packed or extremely high speed design has become a major concern and may limit the circuit's lifetime, reliability, maintainability, etc. A multi-objective optimization and synthesis capability that optimizes designs for power dissipation as well as area or performance, is needed in mainstream CAD tools. Synthesis tools need to expand their capabilities to include power dissipation optimization as well as performance and area optimization. The contractor should not limit itself to the circuit level.

Large amounts of data have traditionally been stored with mechanically-based tape systems. Due to their mechanical nature, these systems are prone to breakage, represent single points of failure, and generate motion that must be compensated for. Unreliable storage on a satellite can, in many cases, render it useless, since the bulk of the data, gathered while the satellite is away from a telemetry reporting site, will be lost. Alternate storage systems, preferably without moving parts, are desired for future space systems. The realization of a solid state data storage system adequate for space use, however, is hindered by the lack of appropriate components, packaging, and architectures. Ideally, a storage system for space would have no moving parts, and, if degradation or failure modes existed, they would occur gradually. This feature would potentially eliminate the need for multiple units, typically needed for mechanically-based systems. Besides this economy of scale, the more versatile data handling flexibility inherent with solid state media allow revolutionary new and simpler data instrumentation schemes to be implemented in space systems. In order for solid state storage solutions to be effective, they must provide a core level of dependable storage for useful mission lifetimes of space systems. Robust recovery systems and creative exploitation of existing component technologies should not be overlooked in achieving a viable storage approach.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: A large solid state storage market exists in nearly every segment of the commercial market, ranging from computer memory cards to high speed instruments, capable of capturing data at phenomenal rates. Space data storage systems can contribute to improving ther reliability and density of their commercial counterparts. In the commercial sector, competitive market pressures place more advance solid state storage concepts in an unfavorable position when compared to mechanical disk drives. In space, however, reliability is an important motivation, and the potential demand, though small compared to commercial markets, is enough to potentially drive the economics of scale for a new technology approach in the direction that can catalyze commercial interest, first in high-reliability, real-time applications; and later in more pervasive, lower cost systems.",,0,"Wojnarowski, R.J. et al.

As feature size decreases to 0.5 micron and below, vibration in the tool induced by floor motion and other ambient factor becomes a limitation. Eventually, it could prevent the most advanced tools from being used in older plants. While active isolation and vibration suppression systems have been demonstrated, they are notoriously sensitive to dynamics of the payload. In simple terms, the stiffer the passive isolation system (higher suspension frequency), the more loop gain is needed in the active system to counteract the forces transmitted through the passive mounts, and the more likely the active loop is to be unstable. What is needed is a passive system capable of suspension frequencies on the order of O.1-0.2 Hz, rather than those currently in use that give 2.0-4.0 Hz.

Tuned passive dampers are an efficient means of providing high damping over a narrow frequency band. However, the dynamics of systems such as boosters and satellites change as fuel is consumed, and the dynamics of solar arrays change due to orientation or time in orbit. Vibration suppression solutions involving tuned passive dampers are of limited use in these cases because of their inability to adapt or re-tune to changing disturbances or structural characteristics over time. Recently, active means of vibration suppression have received a great deal of attention. However, active approaches require continuous power and have the potential of instability if the plant dynamics or controller properties change significantly. An active enhancement for tuned passive capability in the presence of time-varydampers would make those devices extremely effective by ensuring efficient use of the damping capability in the presence of time-varying dynamics. The passive components act as a reliable, built-in capability that relieves system power requirements without reducing the flexibility of a purely active system. The tuning strategy should require significantly less power than active control.",191,1311,1,No,No,No,,"Investigate adaptive/passive vibration suppression concepts and compare with active control and conventional passive dumping techniques.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: Tuned passive dampers are one of the most weight-effective passive damping devices, but mis-tuning has prevented many military and commercial applications. An adaptive/passive device will eliminate this concern. Also a self-tuning, robust, passive tuned damper will find many uses where a harsh or remote environment discourages manual retuning or minimal power is available.

However, today 16 megabytes is the minimum necessary to support a stable-multitasking operating system.

Unfortunately, because the quality of IC die are typically unknown until high-speed burn-in testing can be performed, the reliability and yield of MCMs can be dismal. Low yields lead to great expense, since more units are required to achieve a necessary quantity of working assemblies. If, for example, a method could be established to achieve much greater confidence in the quality of a part before it is committed to an assembly, the yield and reliability of MCMs would be dramatically enhanced. These technologies, referred to as ""known good die"" (KGD) technologies, do not currently exist in a practical form, but are desperately needed for nearly all electronic applications that can take advantage of MCM technology. Particularly for space, KGD technologies can potentially reduce cost in MCMs by replacing many individual qualifications for single components with one comprehensive qualification of a MCM assembly. This potential cost reduction can be substantial in space systems requiring many MCMs to meet functional requirements.",194,1284,1,No,No,No,,"Pursue the fixturing and test methodology issues of the KGD problem.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: KGD technology services the advanced microelectronics packaging industry, which is predicted to become a multi-billion dollar market by 1997. Since technologies capable of constructing non-trivial multi-chip modules have existed, the ""known-food-die"" problem is considered the most pervasive problem affecting the acceptance of MCM technology. The economics of space electronics differs from that of commercial electronics only in degree. Quantities are more modest and price is typically higher, due to qualification requirements. Accordingly, it is suggested that space electronics, due to higher reliability requirements, may be the most challenging proving ground for initially expensive KGD technologies, paving the way for commercial acceptance of KGD and MCM technologies.",,0,"Cogleton, H., Root, R.E.

The ability to attach a current or voltage probe within an electronics enclosure at a critical measurement point on a printed circuit board is severely limited because of the physical size of the probes. This is compounded by the difficulty of routing the sensor cable through the electronics enclosure in such a way as to not destroy the electromagnetic integrity in the process. Current and voltage sensor development has not kept pace with the development of electronics and testers now find themselves unable to make critical measurements. Some attempts to make miniature voltage probes have met with limited success, but they lack the necessary sensitivity to make good measurements in a high-noise environment. The voltage and current probes should be sufficiently small to be compatible with high-density printed circuit boards to allow direct access to measurement points on those boards. Because the induced voltages caused by external electromagnetic fields are usually low in amplitude, some form of amplification should be considered prior to transmitting the signal through an instrumentation cable to an external fiber optic transmitter or recording device. Signal losses combined with background noise can severely limit internal voltage measurements without signal amplification. The amplifier associated with the voltage probe should be sufficiently small so as to fit within the electronics enclosure near the measurement point. The amplifier should be self powered from an internal or external power source. The current probe should be capable of being attached directly to wires or printed circuit board traces without physically modifying the electronics. The frequency range of interest for both probes is: 300 KHz to 1 GHz. The voltage measurement range is from 0.1V to 10V. The current measurement range is from 01ma to 10ma.

This rocket has a theoretical capability of inserting into higher orbits, about twice the payload of current OTVs and will be reusable. The OTV consists of two energy collecting and focusing concentrators which direct sunlight into two small apertures. Within the apertures, are heat exchanging mediums, through which hydrogen gas, our propellant, flows. The hydrogen picks up heat and expands, and thrust is produced out the propulsive nozzle. For our missions, we must keep the package volume and weight of the OTV to a minimum. This means using thin film inflatable concentrators and structural supports as much as possible. They are made of thin film polyimides and are shaped like clamshells or balloons, depending on the type. Both types have a clear light transmission area and a reflectorized light collection area. Micrometeoroids can penetrate the thin film materials easily, leaving larger holes upon exit than entrance. The concentrators' useful life will be of longer time duration if they can patch themselves instead of having to be replaced every other mission or so. Other components required for the solar rocket include but are not limited to: concentrators, thrusters, energy storage/propulsion bi-modal systems, propellant tankage, space sun-trackers, optical quality measurement devices, and laser beam power thrusters. The latest technologies in Solar Thermal Propulsion concentrator components deal with focusing laser light into apertures from ground-based systems; developing, designing and fabricating foam inflation/rigidized structures for supports; and composite material telescoping supports that are lightweight, packageable in small volumes, and self-deployable.

The very broad band tunability of OPO's along with their potential high conversion efficiency makes them ideal for consideration in dial applications. Depending upon the application and required output energy, such a system has the potential for being compact, rugged, and achieve a high time between failure. If operated in a single frequency mode to allow heterodyne detection, improved signal sensitivity and an added doppler sensitivity could be achieved. The Air Force has requirements for environmental compliance monitoring of emission plumes during activities such as open burning disposal of munitions and hazardous wastes, launch activities, range tests, hazardous site remediation activities, and military industrial activities. Current monitoring technologies are not adequate to provide all of the necessary quantitative data required. Point sampling techniques, such as air samplers, can only provide information about one point in the plume, which may not be representative. Passive optical sensors can only provide column content along the pointing direction. Similar limitations of these sensors also apply in applications for monitoring for chemical agent defense. An OPO based dial system would be able to provide large area, range resolved sampling and mapping of the plumes or clouds by scanning the laser beam and using the time of flight of the light pulses to determine an accurate range for each sample. Such a system would not only be able to detect a cloud, but also be able to determine its extent, rate of drift and diffusion, and variations in concentration throughout its measured volume. Application of such a dial lidar system could be from ground and aircraft based platforms. The development and demonstration of a prototype ground based OPO dial system is sought which has the capability to detect chemical clouds with different absorptions of at least %% to ranges over 5 kilometers. The emphasis of the effort is in developing the laser transmitter technology and not in developing new lidar receivers or data acquisition hardware software.",363,2355,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a conceptual design of the OPO based dial lidar system operating in the eyesafe 2 to 9 micron wavelength region, as required by target chemicals.

In addition, the contractor will conduct an analysis on scaling the technology to higher powers to achieve longer measurement ranges and suitability for airborne applications against chemical warfare agents. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: The ability to remotely detect and characterize chemical clouds and plumes with high sensitivity and excellent range resolution has many applications beyond the military ones cited above. Many commercial industrial operations, hazardous remediation activities, and compliance monitoring requirements are similar to those the military must abide by. Further, this technology could be expanded upon by the commercial sector into other areas such as gas leak detection, plume transport model validations, and new types of hand-held point sensor applications.

Zeeman splitting is also cause for some uncertainties in the brightness temperature measurements and retrieved temperature (as a function of geomagnetic coordinates). Since there are almost no clouds within the stratosphere/mesosphere to interfere with appropriately selected nadir-viewing IR sensor operations (e.g. detectors centered on very strong spectral lines), such an IR sensor is not necessarily at a disadvantage compared with a microwave radiometer in terms of all-weather operation. The challenge for the vertical sounding of the stratosphere and lower mesosphere temperature is to have very high spectral resolution (to isolate the strongest absorption features), in the order of 0.01 cm-1 to 0.1 cm-1, with adequate signal/noise. Innovative techniques (such as the Multi-Order Etalon Sounder (MOES) that exploit the periodic transmission characteristics of the Fabry-Perot interferometer coupled with the periodicity of CO2 spectra) that can lead to the development of ultra-high spectral resolution, rugged, small mass, reliable, rapidly deployable IR sensors for the remote sensing of middle atmosphere temperature profiles are sought.",225,1603,1,No,No,No,,"The contractor shall carry out preliminary designs for the innovative techniques, including a conceptual design of the sensors and retrieval simulation to demonstrate the potential sounding accuracy.","The contractor shall develop a working prototype of the IR sensors as a proof of concept.

For instance, the new sensor will also have a variety of commercial applications in air pollution monitoring, industrial process control, and automobile emission monitoring. It can be used as a tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) sensor, a remote sensor for automobile tail-pipe CO/CO2 emission measurements, and a rugged and reliable real-time monitor of industrial gases (such as SO2, N2O, NH3, CO, CO2, etc.) in the chemical and utility industries.",,0,"Wang, J., P.B.Hays, and S.

However, conventional remote sensing techniques, such as weather radar, satellite photography, or lidars, are of only limited use in detecting and characterizing these low density clouds. Weather surveillance radars are unable to detect most non-precipitating clouds, satellite sensors provide information only about cloud tops, and ground-based lidars can observe only the lowest cloud layer in most cases. A sensor is required that will provide information about the spatial structure, microphysics, and internal kinematics of multiple cloud layers, up to a height of about 15 km. A possible candidate technology for the application is that of millimeter-wave radars; these have an advantage over conventional weather surveillance radars in detecting non-precipitating clouds, due to the enhanced scattering from small water droplets at millimeter wavelengths. Technical issues of the remote sensing of clouds have been discussed in a general context (1) and in relation to 35-GHz radars (2,3) and 95-GHz radars (4,5). The previously high cost and limited capability of millimeter wave components has largely restricted millimeter-wave atmospheric research to single polarization, incoherent measurements of cloud backsatter.

Modern ionospheric models are too complex to be used directly.

Solid improvements in beam quality, mode control, frequency and thermal stability, and power points to a future in which diode lasers will play a significant and potentially dominant role in environmental monitoring. Further, the advances in semiconductor quantum-well lasers have enabled materials engineers to ""dial in"" the laser emission bandwidth (i.e., frequency) over the range .63 to 2.2 um (visible to near infrared). This allows any molecular species with absorption bands in this frequency range to be a candidate for monitoring via diode laser spectroscopy. For example, molecules which potentially could be monitored in this range include CO2, CO, NO2, CH4, O2, HC1 HBr, HF, HI, H2S, NH3, and H2O. This short list contains two key greenhouse gasses (CO2 and CH4), species that play critical roles in atmospheric chemistry (NO2, CH4, HC1), gasses important in industrial processes (the halo-acids, H2S, O2, and H2O), and a potentially deadly combustion by-product, carbon monoxide, often found in the home environment. At present, the majority of diode laser environmental monitoring/spectroscopy systems have been laboratory based.

For the military application an appropriate technology must also meet many performance requirements such as pulse energy, repetition rate, size, weight, and reliability. There is currently no clear choice for a fully satisfactory device technology for this application. It is anticipated that the eventual solution will be solid-state lasers pumped with diode laser arrays and perhaps frequency shifted by means of nonlinear optical phenomena, it is not clear that even in the long term NLO techniques will be sufficiently rugged to survive the military environment.

Single pulse experiments using commercial tunable laser sources have shown conversion efficiencies between 25-30% in HF, HCL, and HBr. Inversions in these lasers are produced by pumping with a narrow band ~200mz tunable laser source on the O-2 vibrational overtone transition and then lasing on the 2-1 vibrational fundamental.

As with any piece of optics, there reflection losses reducing the transmitted beam. The presence of any loss is often magnified in many frequency doubling designs by the use of high Q, resonant cavities. The coupling efficiency of the input fundamental light can be increased by either cutting the crystal at Brewster's angle or anti-reflection (AR) coating the crystal. Although the Brewster angle cut minimizes the fundamental frequency reflection, the harmonic frequency reflection losses are increased. A dichroic anti-reflection coating would transmit both the fundamental and harmonic frequencies. BBO crystals have been AR-coated in small lots to reduce the incident reflection losses but the technology has been unreliable. The reliability rate is not sufficient to allow their use in commercial systems. A reliable AR coating process will result in higher effective doubling efficiencies. Possible beneficial side effects of an AR coating are additional protection of the crystal from the environment (BBO is hygroscopic) and a possible increase in the optical damage threshold. A coating should be designed to decrease the fundamental reflection losses to less than 1% and the frequency doubled harmonic frequency reflection losses to less than 2%.

In nearly all the pulse formats (continuous wave, Q-switched pulses, Q-switched modelocked pulses, or continuous-wave modelocked pulses) the absorption of the nonlinear material plays an important role in the design and construction of this frequency-tunable device. In some cases, high absorption can prohibit the construction of such a device. Silver thiogallate, AgGaS2, represents an excellent candidate for the nonlinear material to generate tunable radiation throughout the infrared spectrum. The transmission window extends from 0.5 um to 12 um and is phase matchable with a 1 um- or 2 um-wavelength pump laser. The thermal conductivity is 11 Wm-1 K-1, which is about ten times larger than crystals like KTP, LBO, and BBO. In addition, the coefficient describing the material's nonlinearity is more than an order of magnitude larger than crystals like KTP, LBO, and BBO. These features make AgGaS2 an ideal candidate for generating tunable wavelengths in the range between 2 um and 12 um. Recently, a technique was analyzed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally that combines optical parametric oscillation with sum-frequency generation to efficiently produce frequencies between the pump frequency and two times the pump frequency. When this technique employs AgGaS2, the device can produce tunable radiation over the visible spectrum with a 1 um-wavelength pump source. One of the limiting features of AgGaS2 is its relatively large surface and bulk absorption. Typical values for the bulk absorption in the range from 1 um to 10 um are 0.01 to 0.03 cm-1. Reduction of this absorption by an order of magnitude will greatly improve the usefulness of AgGaS2.",276,1806,1,No,No,No,,Develop and perform analysis of absorption mechanisms in grown samples of AgGaS2 and ascertain the most effective methods to reduce surface and bulk and absorption in the crystal.,"Continue absorption analysis and implement methods to reduce absorption.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: The development of the crystal under this program will enable the construction of optical parametric oscillators that will be useful for many civilian applications. These include remote sensing applications, pollution monitoring of industrial plants and waste sites, process monitoring in manufacturing, identification of agricultural and plant species and growth conditions. Medical applications include glucose monitoring, photo dynamic therapy for cancer, tissue cutting, and cauterization. Commercial aviation would also be impacted by allowing the detection of wind shear.

It is recognized that passive noise control, such as sound barriers, are not effective at low acoustic frequencies. The reason for this is that low frequency acoustic waves are long with respect to typical sound absorbing barriers. For instance, a 100 Hz sound wave has a wavelength of about 3.4 meters and acoustic materials are typically a few centimeters thick, and cannot trap the sound. Because of this, the field of active control has developed extensively over the last 20 years. The problem of acoustics for the Phillips Laboratory (PL) is to suppress the effects of sound waves on military weapons systems. The PL is developing High Energy Laser (HEL) systems under the Airborne Laser program. Acoustic sources on airplanes are plentiful and originate from engines, air flow over the fuselage, and internal carried equipment. These noise waves couple into precision pointing systems such as that used to direct the laser. In the past, attempts to measure the acoustic environment and correlate it with pointing errors have been largely unsuccessful. The reason is that point measurements, such as a single microphone, only measure noise at one point, and the noise actually couples into the pointing system at many distributed locations. Robust Control Theory has been developed over the past ten years to design control systems that have a large number of inputs, perhaps in the hundreds, and ensure optimal system operation. The PL has successfully applied Robust Control Theory to adaptive optics but has not previously used the theory to suppress acoustic disturbances. This project will utilize the technology of Active Noise Control coupled with Robust Control Theory to demonstrate compensation schemes for distributed noise disturbances.",292,1866,1,No,No,No,,Join the fields of Active Noise Control and Robust Control Theory to demonstrate via simulation tools that noise can be suppressed. An optical system with four fixed relay mirrors (sensitive to acoustics) and two beam steering mirrors (also sensitive to acoustics) will be simulated.

Demonstrate that the proposed approach will significantly improve jitter performance of optical relay systems. Invite possible manufacturers of precision machinery susceptible to noise problems to attend the Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs). Develop a package of speakers, hardware interfaces, and associated hardware that can be advertised outside the DOD community. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: The result should be an attractive commercial product to be advertised to many precision hardware manufacturers. One example would be to remove noise effects from large precision machinery that makes semiconductor circuits. Another possibility would be in the communication industry in reducing noise effects in pointing systems to satellites. An extension of the technology would be to measure vibration inputs to the four wheels on a vehicle and use active noise suppression to quiet the ride.",,0,"Widrow, B., Stearns, S.

The development and testing of deformable mirror system prototypes designed for use in such systems date back to the early 1970s and continues to the present day. All operational systems to date have been opto-mechanical in design; based upon the concept of a elastic reflecting surface which is rapidly and continuously deformed by a closed loop feedback process involving a wavefront error sensing device and mirror surface control actuators. While many of these systems have been successfully tested and deployed they typically suffer from operational shortcomings associated with weight, fabrication expense and complexibility, reliability, and serviceability. As a consequence, there is a compelling need to evaluate the application of new component technologies capable of improving the operational performance of adaptive optical systems. Recent advancements in the development of spatial light modulators (SLMs) suggest the possibility of replacing opto-mechanical control of wavefront phase with electro-optical control inside of a solid state device. Once successfully adapted for this application such devices offer the prospect of solid state reliability, low weight, low power consumption, and low purchase price based on cost effective manufacturing processes. The Interferometric Imaging Group of the Phillips Laboratories Lasers and Imaging Directorate has already demonstrated the use of an analog Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) as a wavefront compensation device in a recent proof of concept experiment. Future experiments using more advanced digital devices equipped with wavefront sensors will be required to demonstrate adequate spatial control of the aberrated wavefront together with temporal bandwidth adequate to perform the operational mission. Other significant issues to be resolved include achievable optical throughput efficiencies, the achievable stroke of the SLM phasing elements, the tradeoff between stroke and operating bandwidth, appropriate methods of wavefront sampling, and how best to apply the correction signals to the phasing channels of the SLM device.",326,2307,1,No,No,No,,"Design, fabricate and conduct performance tests on a SLM based wavefront correction device in the laboratory.

Other government agencies involved in long range reconnaissance or surveillance activities within the atmosphere will also benefit from the application(s) of such technology. In the scientific sector the astronomical community uses and is interested in expanding the availability of adaptive optics technology in order to enhance basic astronomical research requiring very high resolution imagery of astronomical sources.

We wish to explore the concept of analyzing data which has been subjected to image compression, such as JPEG, MPEG, or fractal image compression. The civil applications of such image analysis include biomedical imaging (video lesion analysis, MRI data reduction, PET scan analysis, thermal imaging, and x-ray analysis). An analysis system can aid a medical specialist in identifying and highlighting features of concern; real-time capability would bring this assistance much closer to the patient, and increase throughput. Of particular interest to this laboratory is target discrimination and/or identification of missile targets in either isolated or cluttered target scenes; other military target identification is also of interest. The algorithm must operate on a compressed data stream (for future scalability to higher data rates) and should be capable of operating on current standard real-time video data. Minimum initial video rates of 512 X 512 RS-170 or digital video at 30 frames/sec and/or smaller focal planes at proportionally higher frame rates. Compatibility with both visible and IR imagery is required. The objective is to identify features in the scene, isolated them, enhance them, and possibly track them. The algorithm should have the ability to compare large numbers of templates versus input images, and be able to cope with image variation in intensity, rotation, translation, and background. Shape-based algorithms are preferred. The algorithms should run on commercially available image and signal processing hardware for speed of development and to minimize costs. The real-time video analysis platforms should also be easily upgradeable for increased computation (both hardware and software). The user needs to be able to interactively analyze the progress of the algorithm and add new templates to the system to examine and compare to a wider class of reference images. For medical and dual-use applications, the system should be self-contained, flexible, and use a standardized high-capability, high-capacity image processing bus so to be adaptable to many input data sources.

We are specifically aware of medical efforts in video lesion analysis, MRI data reduction, PET scan analysis, thermal imaging, and x-ray analysis. Since we are insisting that the effort be based on commercial off-the-shelf video hardware, we expect that advances as part of this program can be readily packaged into commercial products for the medical imaging analysis market. Because we are looking for a method which is compatible with commercial image compression techniques, we expect developments would be easily incorporated into emerging commercial standards for digital medical imaging, and would in fact enhance the functionality of such systems. Fostering such commercial standardization and performance, along with compatibility with similar military needs, would benefit DoD by leading to capabilities which leverage a strong commercial base.

Since hydrazine is highly toxic and a suspected carcinogen, launch personnel must be protected from exposure to hazardous levels. Currently, there is no field operational detector that can monitor hydrazine vapor levels at the 10 ppb, 8-hr time-weighted-average threshold limit values (TLV's) that are expected to become the new exposure standard in the near future. These TLV's are a factor of 10, or more, below present standards. Thus, a significant advance in monitoring technology is needed. Recent progress suggests that a novel approach based on reversible or irreversible colorimetric reagent clad optical fibers may allow real time fuel vapor detection below 10 ppb. Innovative, low cost, reliable methods for manufacturing fiber optic sensors that employ chemical reagents for detecting hydrazine fuel vapors need to be developed. The time and cost for developing new space propulsion engines and advanced energetic propellants could be significantly reduced if the benefits of inexpensive laser based optical diagnostics were available in rugged, flight worthy form. These devices would enable in-situ optimization of fuel mixture ratio, detection of abnormal operation (health monitoring), and monitoring of exhaust pollutants. Rapid advances in electro-optics technology imply that realization of the potential inherent in optical techniques is immanent. For example, visible wavelength diode lasers capable of producing picosecond pulses of GHz repetition rates, and a solid state photo multiplier (PMT) with a 10.6 improvement in dynamic range over conventional PMT's are currently available. Such advances could allow the combustion characteristics of tiny samples of advanced propellant ingredients to be obtained from a single transient event.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: Hydrazine is used by: AFSPACECOM at launch ranges; ACC where fighter aircraft auxiliary power units (APU's) are serviced; the Navy and NASA and industry at rocket launch sites. Hydrazine exposure can also occur at production facilities, industrial users and at waste disposal sites. The SBIR hydrazine sensing technology would be used directly at these locations to limit the exposure of personnel to this dangerous material. By varying the chemical makeup of the optical fiber cladding reagents, this same technology has enormous potential to be widely applied as a sensitive, low cost means of detecting wide ranges of compounds. By cladding fibers with materials that are color sensitive to pressure, temperature, etc. this technique could see broad industrial application in manufacturing process control, as well as in many other applications. Low cost, rugged, electro-optic based measurement techniques could be widely applied throughout DoD to optimize and control, as well as in many other applications. Low cost, rugged, electro-optic based measurement techniques could be widely applied throughout DoD to optimize and control propulsive combustion devices and to monitor their operation and emissions. Similarly, this technology could be applied to automobile, diesel and marine internal combustion engines. Their low cost would also facilitate use in industrial applications for monitoring stack emissions from power plants and chemical manufacturing plants to name only two of an almost unlimited range of possible applications. Another characteristic of some electro-optic devices is the ability to operate on a picosecond time scale. When coupled with appropriate data acquisition approaches, the SBIR methodology could lead to the ability to measure chemical events that are currently too fast to be measured or observed.

Wide bandwidth radiometers are often used to detect signals emitted from these systems. The sensitivity of these radiometers is limited by the stationarity of the background noise environment and the stability of the radiometer circuitry. The amplitude of the environmental noise decreases with increasing frequency and varies considerably with location. The average level of this noise power in the United States can be more than 16 decibels higher in urban than in suburban areas. In remote rural locations, the level may be 15 decibels below that experienced in a typical suburban site. The most important sources of this noise are atmospheric noise, galactic noise, man-made noise, and receiver noise.

Automating the routine tasks associated with sensor management helps to improve situation awareness and reduce pilot workload, ultimately increasing mission effectiveness and survival. Preliminary research into the intelligent management of distributed sensor assets has revealed several challenges which are worthy of further study and summarized below. These include the study of nonmyopic prioritization and planning, the investigation of scheduling issues, and the development and extension of theoretical techniques to accommodate the multiplatform sensor management problem. Submitted proposals can address all of these challenges or any subset; comprehensive treatments will not be favored over high-quality proposals addressing a specific challenge(s). The first challenge is to devise methods for sensor allocation that account for the evolution of the mission through time. Previous attempts to design sensor managers have been largely myopic, i.e., focused on the near-term aspects of the prioritization problem, usually looking just one step ahead. Such managers fail to anticipate the inevitable changes adequately. Issues that must be addressed in this challenge include a highly uncertain environment that contains both natural and manmade variations; times when sensor demand exceeds capacity; a very dynamic situation where the threat configuration, the mission goals, and the pilot's actions may change rapidly; enormous complexity arising out of the mix of interrelated random variables, decisions, and outcomes; the potential for high computational loads based on large state sizes and modeling difficulties; conflicting objectives such as the need to remain covert but still know the situation precisely; and wide differences in sensor abilities, controls, and limitations.The second challenge involves sensor scheduling, where sensor requests from prioritization are forged into a detailed sensor sequencing plan. Several difficulties arise: multiple tasks may contend for the same resource; ongoing tasks may need to be suspended, terminated, or relocated; tasks may have hard or soft deadlines; tasks may or may not be interruptable; and tasks may be of uncertain duration. While a task is waiting, environmental conditions or objectives may change, rendering it suddenly necessary or unnecessary. Unfortunately, the task prioritization and resource scheduling problems are generally treated separately in the theory. This effort would integrate scheduling considerations into the overall decision process. For example, this would include optimal resolution of task collisions, adaptive adjustment of planning horizons, and a high degree of responsiveness to very dynamic situations.The final challenge is to manage a distributed network of sensors across cooperating platforms. This may require the development or adaptation of theoretical techniques. The issues involved include distributed resource controls across aircraft, coordination of functions, and alignment considerations. In order to synchronize activities, resources such as the high accuracy clock signals from GPS may be used. One major function of the sensor manager is to supply useful data to the pilot; therefore, issues such as data latency, communications burden, and data accuracy will be investigated.",489,3496,1,No,No,No,,Develop sensor management technology to solve all or some of these diverse issues.,"Phase II will further develop the candidate techniques. This phase will then design, utilize, and test these techniques through simulation. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: The manufacturing industry may will use the resource allocation methods in production planning and scheduling. These technologies are especially useful in manufacturing for automated multistep processes which use sensors to determine positioning, defects, and other factors. Resource allocation problems for R&D projects having multiple, competing objectives in an uncertain environment is another dual use for this technology. Other non-traditional use for these defense technologies are the automobile industry, underwater exploration and mining, space exploration, and robotics. The automotive industry is an especially attractive dual use for this technology. This is because the automobile manufacturers are being pushed to develop sensor management technologies with new car developments such as computer controls, GPS, onboard maps, and other intelligent features. Also, the technologies for sensor allocation and scheduling, and information sharing across multiple platforms will be a critical item for the Intelligent Vehicle Highway System being developed.",,0,"Multiplatform Resource Sharing CRDA Report, W.

For example, Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) provide a navigation solution, radar provides relative target location, and electronic combat sensors provide relative threat location. Typically, this information is gathered, processed and analyzed only by the operationally responsible mission suite of the sensor. Thus, useful information is not being shared among sensor suites. Providing a means to make this information available to all mission suites could improve the desired solutions of avionic suites, reduce costs (removal of redundant sensors and/or reduce specifications of some sensors), improve target tracking, reduce GPS jamming susceptibility, improve in-air alignments, speed up weapon GPS receiver code lock, and many other tasks. A solution to this problem is to create a geometric vector (GV) and update this GV with the raw measurements from the avionic sensors. The GV is a ten-element vector consisting of three position variables, three velocity variables, three attitude variables, and one time variable. This GV can be used as an absolute or relative reference. An example of an absolute geometric vector might be the position, velocity, and attitude of a vehicle with respect to the earth's surface plus Greenwich Meridian Time, and with the basis of the GV being an INS and GPS while measurement from other sensors are applied when available and necessary. When two systems, each represented by a GV, operate relative to each other, a relative geometric vector (RGV) can be formed by subtracting the two GVs. As stated above, most avionic sensors provide geometric information and thus provide measurements that contain some or all of the elements of GV or RGV.",279,1825,1,No,No,No,,"The contractor shall investigate how a GV will contribute and benefit various military aircraft missions.

There is a need to be able to accurately model and simulate the electromagnetic and thermal effects of the different vertical interconnects that may be used, such as coaxial interconnects, elastomerics, button boards, etc., between substrates to connect MMICs with other MMICs and digital circuits. The simulation must take into account the different substrate that the interconnect will be passing through (i.e. AlN, LTCC, HT., alumina, AlSiC, etc.) as well as if the chip is flipped or right side up. Another problem that the MCM (Multiple Chip Module) designer faces is the ability to simulate an entire active circuit and obtain the S- parameters needed. The electromagnetic simulator program must be able to include zero-dimensional (mathematical, elements without specific geometry) circuit models of the active devices. These circuit models of the active devices would provide a connection between the input and output micro strip matching networks contained within the package. However, the active device models would not interact electromagnetically with the model. The circuit models of the active devices must include dependent sources (i.e. current-controlled current sources, current-controlled voltage sources, voltage- controlled current sources, and voltage-controlled voltage sources). There are two main tasks of this program, interconnects and active MMICs. The offeror is asked to respond to one or both tasks.

Damage/Life/Risk Assessment of Aircraft Structures: A variety of critical service problems are currently plaguing our aging aircraft fleets and threatening them with grounding or shortened service lives because accurate methodologies for prediction and assessment do not exist today. These problems include but are not limited to corrosion fatigue, multiple-site damage (MSD), fretting fatigue, fretting corrosion, joint debonding, composite delamination, and composite impact damage. Research efforts should involve enhancing damage detection methods, generating analytical methodologies for predicting the effects of various forms of aircraft structural damage, validating these methodologies through experimental testing, and turning these methodologies into accurate predictive computer models. These models shall be suitable for integration into PC based, deterministic fatigue crack growth and probabilistic risk assessment computer programs.

Dynamic Effects on Aircraft Structural Integrity: Unsteady/separated flows are producing excessive dynamics loads in the form of acoustics, buffet, flutter, and vibration which result in premature structural failures and exorbitant repair time and costs. For example, aeroacoustic loads generated by turbulent boundary layers in attached and separated flows have a significant impact on the vibration response of aircraft structures and externally carried stores. Moreover, the transonic flow regime can produce rms pressure loads an order of magnitude over attached flow levels commensurate with that encountered with separated flow regimes. Emphasis areas are as follows: 1)Methods for predicting and techniques for alleviating buffet. 2)Techniques for actively suppressing flow induced weapons bay acoustics. 3)Methodology for predicting aeroacoustic loads associated with attached and separated subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flows. 4)Methodology for analyzing high angles of attack in fighter aircraft.",352,2687,1,No,No,No,,"The desired end products are: a) computer code modules suitable for integration with existing deterministic fatigue crack growth and probabilistic risk assessment computer programs, b)established techniques, and/or c)sensor design.","Expected work to be accomplished is through experimental validation of the methodologies, techniques, and/or sensors designed as a result of Phase I efforts.

Design and analysis methods significantly influence aircraft structure performance parameters such as weight, cost, signature, service life, producibility, and supportability. New structural design and analysis methods are needed to support the development of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). The objective is to reduce the design cycle time and to simultaneously optimize performance parameters to meet increasingly stringent design and affordability requirements. Design methods are needed to address the integration of aerodynamics (including recent development in computational fluid dynamics) and flight controls in the context of aircraft structural design optimization. New instrumentation technology is also sought to benchmark design and analysis methods. Design and analysis methods are sought for three emerging classes of structural concepts: lightweight, low-cost, low signature structures, smart structures, and thermal structures. The impact of conceptual design and preliminary design on the weight, cost, and signature of structures is significant. Low cost concurrent engineering optimization methods are needed to fuse performance requirements with producibility and supportability requirements. New design and analysis methods are needed for smart structures with embedded sensors, actuators, and processors for structural health monitoring and damage detection, radio frequency antenna performance, and active vibration and structural shape control. Methods are required to analyze and predict embedded sensor performance, process and interpret sensor data, and predict the effects of embedded sensors on the strength, durability, and damage tolerance of structure. Methods are required to analyze and predict embedded actuator performance and global structural response to embedded actuators. Smart material sensor arrays are required for measuring real-time, steady-state, dynamic strain. Finally, new design and analysis methods are required for extreme environment structures of high mach (> Mach 3) vehicles and engine exhaust impinged structures subjected to combined high temperature and acoustic environments.

These systems will require new materials to be developed to maintain high pointing accuracy requirements. Thus, these materials must be (1) dimensionally stable, which require a high stiffness to resist thermal strain; highly conductive to reduce temperature drops across the structure; a near zero coefficient of thermal expansion to minimize thermal strain; and a high specific stiffness to increase the natural frequency of vibration and (2) lightweight to minimize launch costs. The use of advanced carbon-carbon or organic matrix composites such as cyanate esters satisfy these requirements. Novel processing approaches for either organic matrix composites or carbon-carbon composites are encouraged. For carbon-carbon composites, innovative, low cost, quickly manufactured processes are encouraged. Currently, the cost of high modulus or high conductivity composites is dominated by the cost of graphite fibers (up to 85%). Enormous cost reductions in making high conductivity carbon-carbon may be possible using copyrolisis techniques. Organic matrix composites offer weight savings over conventional materials with competitive costs. Some of the challenges of such materials for space applications include low thermal distortion, high stiffness, long-term stability under the space environment, and thermal conductivity. Materials that meet these challenges must also be robust in processing. Innovative processes may be utilized to better meet the challenges, such as non autoclave curing.

The increasing emphasis on electronics has made electrical distribution a critical aircraft system. A scientifically based approach for ascertaining when to replace wiring in aging military and commercial aircraft currently does not exist. Replacement costs can be considerable and failure to replace aged or degraded wiring can lead to serious mishaps. Wiring systems typically consist of insulation materials, conductors, and connectors. To reduce weight and volume, wiring systems are made-up of thin walled polymer materials that provide electrical insulation and small diameter, low resistance, high strength conductors. Typical wiring problems include (not in order of importance) chafing or mechanical damage, degradation due to thermal effects and chemical attack, electrical breakdown, conductor corrosion, thin film formation on contacts, and various manufacturing defects. Many of the above problems and other important wiring properties can be related to time, temperature, and stress.

Computer codes are now available to perform real-time dynamics analysis of all types of rolling bearings under fairly complex operating environments. However, most of the current work is restricted to isothermal conditions and there is little or no consideration for thermal interactions in the bearings. The objectives of this effort are, therefore, to develop models for thermal interactions, implement the models in available bearing dynamics computer codes, and demonstrate the significance of thermal interactions in overall dynamic behavior of rolling element bearings. The computational procedures shall be incorporated in the bearing dynamics codes and the practical significance of the model and feasibility of the overall approach shall be demonstrated by dynamic analysis for each type of bearing under typical turbine engine operating environment.

As turbine fleets age and as advanced, higher temperature turbine engines enter the market, the mechanical and thermal oxidative stresses placed on the oil system will increase significantly, thereby establishing conditions that will more quickly and harshly wear mechanical systems and degrade the lubricant. Excessive wear and lubricant degradation can lead to severe engine component damage or failure. Furthermore, it is beneficial to know exactly when to change the oil. Premature oil changes impact the environment and produce excessive and unnecessary cost for both labor and materials as well as decreased operational readiness. However, oil changes that are too late can result in even greater costs due to the need for increased engine maintenance caused by excessively degraded oil. To avoid these potential problems, development of small, lightweight (less than 1 or 2 pounds), and inexpensive sensors that integrate wear and lubricant condition monitoring capabilities is desirable. This could replace expensive and time intensive laboratory analysis and alert personnel to operational wear and oil degradation problems in real time. Also, it could allow ""just-in-time"" oil change intervals to be established.

Budget constraints are forcing worldwide Air Forces to evaluate modifying new and used commercial aircraft for military use and to extend the life of existing military systems. The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology reported that in 1986, nearly half of the U.S. airline fleet was 15 years old. The life expectancy of an aircraft is primarily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems, structural components, and the materials of which they are made.

This development has pursued two options: direct diode LADAR for shorter range, lower cost applications; and diode-pumped solid state LADAR for longer range, higher cost applications. Diode lasers have improved steadily over the years, with improvements in beam quality, peak power, and pulse energies. At the same time costs for these devices continue to drop. The development of compact diode drivers has not kept pace with the diode development, being limited to l00 amp peak currents at slower than desired rise and fall times. In order to provide the power requirements for direct diode LADAR, a diode driver with the capability to provide 200 amps of peak current is required, with 500 amps desired. The pulse widths need to be in the range of 3 to 20 nanosecond, with l to l0 nanosecond desired. The pulse repetition frequency must be at least l0 kilohertz, with 20 kilohertz desired. The overall package size for the driver should be less than 27 cubic inches. The package should be designed to minimize electro magnetic interference effects on the range board and detector electronics to be located close to the driver package.

Accurately measure the tube or manifold wall thickness after cleaning.,"One product of jet fuel combustion is a hard, black substance called coke. Jet engine fuel tubes and manifolds build up coke and are frequently blocked by this substance from normal operation of the engine. This build up and/or blockage causes a reduction in engine efficiency and possibly premature engine removal and retirement of the tube/manifold. Chemical removal methods have met limited success, but have been unable to clean completely blocked tubes and are also undesirable due to their environmental impact. The abrasive flow method of cleaning has been successful, but tends to remove tube parent material and thus thins the tube wall causing a reduction in structural stability and cannot clean tubes that are completely blocked. Moreover, there is no reliable or expedient method to measure tube wall thickness after cleaning. Fuel manifolds and tubes are generally manufactured from stainless steel, inconel and titanium and are consequently quite expensive. The cost to replace blocked or badly coked tubes and the effects of chemical cleaning methods on the environment justify the need to develop an innovative mechanical method to clear and clean blocked fuel tubes and manifolds and to measure the effect of the cleaning on the tube wall thickness. The technology required to remove coke from a jet engine fuel tube will require development of some type of abrasive, cutting tool or other suitable method that is capable of removing a substance that borders on having the same hardness as a diamond. Additionally, the method employed must be capable of following the complex shape of a fuel shape that renders current methods of mechanical cleaning unsuitable.

FPAs (PtSi, HgCdTe, PbSe, Si:Ga/As/Sb, Ge:Au/Cd/Cu/Hg/Zn, InSb, etc.), are manufactured in essentially two distinct phases. The first phase produces the FPA chip/die and is based on processes similar to those used to manufacture microelectronic integrated circuits. The second phase involves marrying the FPA chip/die with other microelectronic components for array control and data readout. After this second phase, a complete, final FPA module assembly is formed. Unfortunately, at present, it is not until this final module is completed that functional testing can be performed. The overall outcome is one of increased investment in labor and material after each step in the process; and it is not presently possible to determine if the final product is successful until all steps and materials have been incorporated. Thus, since the entire manufacturing process can take up to 12 weeks to complete, much time and effort is spent on modules which may ultimately prove to be defective. Current defect rates are in the order of 80% and are attributed to defective FPA chips/die. As a consequence, the availability of fully functional FPA modules is limited; and the price of those produced is unacceptably high. The purpose of this project is to intervene in the early stage of FPA chip/die manufacturing process by testing the chips/die before being assembled with the other, added-value support electronics. This project is to design and develop a special non-contact test probe unit which can be used to test the FPA chips/die after they have been microelectronically-produced and before being assembled with any other circuit components.

The PT will assist special operations aviators in more rapidly accomplishing their search and rescue (SAR) missions. This major enhancement to the special forces mission is made possible by a modular polarized three-line scanning lens (powered by a 9 volt camera battery) that is easily attached to a hand-held camera instead of the existing lens. The polarized scanning lens technology uses proprietary hardware modifications to an existing chip. The PT can be optimized (between 2 and 100 microns) to detect the presence of a small quantity of polarized plastic that is about the size of a credit card or floppy disc. The camera ""sees"" more than ""unaided normal"" human vision and easily displays the polarized target as a glowing red-violet color. Consequently, the PT technology allows for rapid identification and location of friendly assets (e.g., troops or equipment) that are concealed out of necessity amongst the background cover. This provides for more expeditious pick up of assets and a decreased probability of fratricide to airborne, ground- or sea-based assets. Additional research is required to benefit from the enhanced speed that would be realized from a totally self-contained chip with software optimized for performance. This additional research would also enhance the signal and reduce the noise resulting in an even clear picture and longer detection ranges. In addition, to the reduction of fratricide and SAR times, the PT technology could be used to mark a landing/drop zone. Other pertinent information would include passive identification of where on the surface ordnance should hit to destroy a concealed (no show) target such as a bunker or underground tunnel without divulging this information to the adversary.

Prediction of the expected life, durability and damage tolerance characteristics of structural and electronic components is important in designing and maintaining military equipment. In particular, Multichip Modules (MCM) are currently being developed for Air Force applications by several manufacturers. These modules are the next generation packaging technology. As such they will be present in nearly every piece of equipment used by the Air Force warfighter. They will be subjected to harsh environments (e.g., thermal, electromagnetic, structural). It is imperative that the Air Force have adequate modeling and simulation tools to assure that environmental hardness is built in during the original design. In order to assess the possibility of failure caused by strain and stress of MCM components, it is necessary to accurately calculate such values at multi-material boundaries where many failures are initiated. To date, the accuracy of this assessment has been poor due to singularity issues. Development of computational algorithms and software for the accurate calculation of strains and stresses near singularities remains an undeveloped, but vitally needed, component of complete MCM reliability assessment capability. Accurate and efficient algorithms and software are now being sought for the computation of the generalized stress intensity factors which characterize the temperature and stress fields at multi-material interfaces where stress mismatch drives damage nucleation. The formulation of failure criteria for multi-material interfaces subjected to thermal and mechanical loading involves functionals, the exact values of which are finite and in sensitive to minor variations in topology. Conventional prediction of thermaomechanical responses suffer from a variety of sources of numerical error.

The desirability of integration of inputs from more than a single sensor in order to interpret and analyze scenes has been apparent to researchers for a long time. It has been the object of intense research for the past two decades. To date however, there are only a few examples of successful sensor fusion system in actual application. The intensity of computation, and the state of computation and sensor technology themselves prevented meaningful realization of such integration. Low resolution sensors can detect the states of sparse pixels in a scene. Such detection is fast and efficient but not sufficient to provide information for object recognition. However, it is sufficient to detect the existence of an object. High resolution sensors can detect the state of pixels close to one another. They can therefore be efficient in extracting object features in a relatively small neighborhood. The idea behind the dynamic integration of low and high resolution sensors is that upon detection of the existence of an object, the low resolution sensor transfers this information to the high resolution sensor for further intense investigation. The high resolution sensor in turn, upon identifying an object of interest, could ""abstract"" its features and signal the low resolution sensor to re-investigate other parts of the scene for possible additional such abstractions.

These compounds are known to be recalcitrant to biodegradation. All other components of AFFF, such as glycol ether and hydrocarbon surfactants, are readily biodegradable by native soil bacteria. The goal of Phase I and Phase II proposed research is to (1) predict impact of AFFF fluorocarbon surfactants on in situ biodegradation processes; (2) recommend methods to prevent negative impacts on biodegradation processes; and (3) recommend modifications to biodegradation processes to prevent the negative impacts of the fluorocarbon surfactants. The research must establish the effect of soil type on the sorption of fluorocarbon surfactants on unsaturated soils, and the influence of soil contaminants (e.g., petroleum hydrocarbons) on the fluorocarbon surfactants. It must address the sorbed and unsorbed portions of the surfactants, quantify these amounts, and determine how these different surfactant phases and soil types affect bubble formation during aeration. Research should provide information on the influence of the fluorocarbon surfactants in unsaturated soils on the transport of contaminants in those soils, in addition to addressing the movement of the fluorocarbon surfactants through the soil. These questions could be answered in the first phase. This is necessary to develop methods used to prevent or control fluorocarbon surfactants from creating potential problems from bubble formation with remediation technologies such as in situ aerobic bioremediation. Knowledge gained through this research can be incorporated into a treatment process plan for fluorocarbon surfactant-contaminated sites. Knowledge gained from the first effort would be refined in the second phase where methods to reduce the negative impact of AFFF on biodegradation technologies will be applied to sites with surfactant-contaminated vadose soils (e.g., fire training facilities with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination). A model is expected which can be applied to remediation technologies. It may either be a prototype applicable to various sites, or a computer-generated model available for use at both military and civilian fluorocarbon surfactant-contaminated sites (e.g. predict the affect of fluorocarbon surfactants on remediation applications).

The Flight Dynamics Directorate has developed a prototype system called ""ASTROS"" (Automated Structural Optimization System), which runs on most modern work stations and mainframes. ASTRO' comprehensive self-contained system allows easy enhancement and additions of new engineering modules. Any expansion related to airframe and other aircraft subsystems optimization qualifies as a potential topic for this solicitation. In the development of aging aircraft technology the goal is to generate methodologies for determining, assessing, and predicting the effects of various forms of aircraft service damage. FLIGHT CONTROL: Simulation has proved to be an invaluable tool for aircraft and flight control design. This tool can be used earlier in the design cycle by having near-real-time simulations hosted on personal computers. The critical problem is inputting, in minimum time, aerodynamic data generated from analysis and from multiple wind tunnel tests including rotary balance testing. Generic control law structures, actuator and sensor models should be utilized, and interfaces with standardized control techniques law design software provided. Ideas for improvements to technologies, techniques, or subsystems used in single-site or networked flight simulators are solicited. Hardware or software, which improves performance and fidelity or lowers the cost of simulating an aircraft subsystem, are of particular interest, as are novel uses of commercially available video and display technology. Ideas are solicited for human factors investigations of effects of network delays on long haul simulations. Areas of special interest include the identification of types of tasks which can be meaningfully simulated as with various amounts of network delays. AEROMECHANICS: Sol-gel materials because of their unique nonlinear optical properties, can be engineered to optimize applications of interests to the Air Force. These applications include real-time holographic interferometry; high-speed spatial-light modulators; new sensors covering ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths; and large storage media for use in flow field diagnosis. Advanced sensor concepts for time-resolved pressure measurements in high-speed wind tunnels are sought. Convective scale fluid dynamic phenomena are difficult to access computational. Therefore, they are a fruitful area for experimental research. Current research is hampered by the lack of pressure sensors which respond at frequencies of interest (typically 200kz to 1 MHz) and which will survive the temperatures typical of high spec wind tunnels. VEHICLE SUBSYSTEMS: Applicator nozzles of cryogenic, CO2 pellet-jet-blast cleaning and surface preparation equipment are of interest to the Air Force and proposals are solicited for their design and development. Current aircraft maintenance surface cleaning methods typically involve environmentally nonhazardous materials such as CO2 pellets, but may not be as efficient or as cost effective as desired. Applicator nozzle optimization should reduce operative costs and improve cleaning efficiency and abate noise of the equipment while ensuring an environmentally safe system. Design should be based on comprehensive understanding of the associated fluid and particle dynamics phenomena achieved through computational flowfield analysis and modern experimental techniques. a. Infrared detector technologies have been developed that utilize sampling of air for the presence of flammables, by passing it through a short gap of about 1 centimeter. The purpose is to find methods to detect the presence of flammable gases prior to ignition so that preemptive actions can be taken. An improved approach would use an open channel or long optical path to provide direct monitoring of the protected space rather than involving long time delays associated with short gap monitoring. b. The cooling techniques and heat transport system must be environmentally friendly, interface compatible with lightweight aircraft structures and avionics equipment, be lightweight themselves, affordable, producible, thrifty in terms of fluid flow pressure losses incurred and blower power consumption, with a goal to double the capacity of currently used systems, without sacrifice in thermal control quality. The expanded performance capabilities of modern and retrofitted military aircraft require the transfer of large quantities of waste heat from closely packed internal equipment. Methods need to be developed to greatly increase the heat transfer intensity and capacity of circulating gas systems suitable for cooling aircraft equipment and subsystems.

Competitive pressures have increased the emphasis on the virtual capability to produce many products in small economic batches. Contained in the definition of virtual manufacturing is an integrated synthetic environment which can be exercised to enhance all levels of decision and control. VM-EFM is an enabler necessary to ""perform realizable manufacturing in the computer."" Federated models hold the promise of decision support and meaningful communication among disparate enterprises. d) Virtual Enterprise Distributed Object Management Environment (VEDOME): The open nonintrusive architecture of VEDOME will be open and solve operational issues in the object management manager and object broker standards. This effort will demonstrate distributed management of assured transactions in real time for activities, programs, networks, and multiple data structures in a heterogeneous computing environment. A tailored VEDOME will support different manufacturing applications and end-users in industry and government enterprises. Systems administrators and end-users will automatically be provided their preferred intelligent user interface. e) Near-netshape Casting Producing Machine (NCPM): The response time for delivery of product to customer's specifications in the global manufacturing market is the competitive edge. The NCPM demonstration will dynamically create precise and predictable near-netshape castings for end-products; derived from the digital product definition data of end products and their features. Resulting die sets can be precision coated (via sensor based plasma spray, etc.) and treated (thermally, etc.) for final tolerance. Design data for NCPM use will support the control of material properties and characteristics during material forming and transformation as design specified directly. Statistical data will be gathered, organized, analyzed, and modeled in categories of quality, cost, and performance and reported against traditional approaches.

We are soliciting ideas for the following two areas: a) Ideas for acquiring data optically from large arrays of microsensors measuring pressure, temperature, and wall shear stress are sought. An array of 1000 x 1000 sensors or greater could be of interest. Spatial and temporal resolution of scales which are characteristic of turbine blades and vanes is desired in low temperature (200-500F) research facilities. This capability would likewise be useful for a number of external aerothermal flows on aircraft and missiles. We would like to be able to resolve film cooling flows, film cooling effectiveness, heat transfer, pressure distribution, secondary flows, shocks, shock motion, separation, transition, and reattachment simultaneously with 10 to 30 realizations per blade passage. Temporal resolution capable of at least capturing and freezing the large scale motion in these flows would include scales at least as small as the region of high shear in the boundary layer. A spatial resolution as high as 10 sensors/mm might be desired in some situations. Currently, a number of silicon microsensors are being developed to accomplish many of the above tasks but simultaneous acquisition of a large dense array which depends upon a conventional A to D approach involves the very difficult or impossible task of wiring many individual sensors. An equally difficult task is recording the many channels of information, as is the formidable task of reduction and processing the data from large arrays. The goal of this effort would be to provide data realizations with both spatial and temporal resolutions comparable to the best computations with would be capable of being processed optically. b) Interdisciplinary proposals for novel energy and power materials and devices with high payoffs in performance, reliability, and cost benefits for nonpropulsive aerospace power applications (e.g. The more Electric Airplane Initiative) and energy storage applications are being sought . Topics of interest include the following: (1) Conventional and high temperature (>200C) semiconductor power device materials and large area electronic structures (gates, contacts, dopants) and processing methods. (2) Dielectric coatings for semiconductors and conductors (e.g. conducting polymer wire coating). (3) Novel soft and hard high temperature, low loss, high strength magnetic materials for aerospace generators, motors, and MHz inductive resonant switching devices. (4) Lithiated and other conducting polymers for novel battery electrolytes. (5) EMI suppressing/attenuating coatings and/or composite packaging structures. (6) Novel high heat flux (100 W/cm2) thermally stable coolants and high conductive interfaces for high temperature electronic cooling. (7) Conducting polymers and contacts for power transmission (e.g. lightweight wire) and novel capacitor materials and devices.

Alternative stripping technologies, such as high-pressure water and medium- pressure bicarbonate blasting, avoid the accumulation of spent blasting media in the waste but still contain paint residues contaminated with metals. A novel method is being sought to treat water blasting paint residue to further reduce the volume or separate the metals (mainly chromate) from the paint residue. This approach can significantly reduce the amount of solid hazardous waste requiring disposal in a landfill and possibly make metals reuse a more economical option. A small stand-alone paint residue reduction system is desired that can be easily integrated with current Air Force depainting operations.

Another potential approach would involve alternately pulsing two different cosubstrates, such as methane and propane.

An initial assessment must be made of the relative importance of each of the scattering phenomena and the relevance of each to an overall image. A model would then be developed to determine the visual effect or image produced from a relatively low power laser. This model must include the effects of various atmospheric conditions, different windscreen or canopys, and variations in the human eye. It is known that the general visual effect will be to reduce the contrast between other objects and the background in the rest of the visual field of view. However, a quantitative model has not yet been developed. The reduction in contrast means that it will now be harder to identify or even acquire targets within the visual scene. Targets can be tanks on the ground, other aircraft, a runway, or road signs while driving. The same model for lasers could be used for sun glare, glints, or other headlights. A separate model needs to be developed to predict how the visual effect of scattering will affect tactical decision making. This will include such things as ""When will a pilot need to abort a mission?"", ""When will a mission be unsuccessful?"" and ""How might tactics be changed so that it will not be necessary to abort a mission?"".",252,1474,1,No,No,No,,Phase I will determine the relative importance of each of the scattering phenomena and the relevance of each to an overall problem. This phase should also detail a modeling plan for the degraded visual effects and the relation to tactical decision making.,"Phase II will develop a computer model which would accurately simulate the complete propagation path of a laser beam as it propagates through the atmosphere, through a windscreen or canopy, and then through the eye for final image formation. The model would then use the degraded visual image within a complete tactical decision making environment. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: The commercialization aspect of the scattering models will help in the development of windscreens (e.g. automobile windshields) that are better able to reduce glare. Glare from the sun or other automobiles is of vital importance to the automobile safety community. These models will not only incorporate windshield shape, but will be able to model residues on the windshield, smog in the cities, and the increased glare experienced by the ageing eye. The model could also be used for canopy acceptance criteria, canopy design, and visor analysis. Other potential uses include commercial aircraft windscreens as well as improved airfield lighting systems. The automotive industry will find models such as this helpful in designing more effective and safer headlights. Different lighting designs could be run through the model in order to determine effects with regard to driving safety. RELATED",,0,"Varner, D. C., R. M. Cartledge, W. R. Elliott, A. R. Menendez, R.

This topic is related to the DoD thrust on Technology for Training and Readiness. Successful programs of basic research in the area of intelligent automated instruction (Intelligent Tutoring Systems - ITS) are described across a diverse array of professional, technical, and scientific publications. There is an opportunity for focused transition of this emerging technology out of research laboratories and into more applied settings in part, because current-generation microprocessors offer powerful delivery platforms at reasonable expense. The challenge that remains, however, is to scale up from isolated and simplistic laboratory instructional domains to fully developed real-world instructional domains. Three related issues stand in the way of scaling up. First, instructional techniques used by any particular researcher in the ITS field tend to be applied to one instructional domain or a small number of closely related instructional domains. Thus, the generality of the instructional technique is in question. Second, student modeling frameworks used by any particular researcher in the ITS field tend to be applied to one instructional domain or a small number of closely related instructional domains. Thus, the generality of the student modeling framework technique is in question. Third, the tutoring systems developed by researchers in the ITS field tend to be monumental individually-tailored programs sometimes written in exotic languages.

Low cost will be assured by basing the system on an IBM-compatible personal computer.

The graphics accelerator must be readily scaleable into a multiprocessor system, and a detailed estimate must be provided as to the number of graphics accelerators that will ultimately be required to generate the full-resolution real-time system as described above. An image display bus must also be identified, and it must be demonstrated that the chosen graphics accelerator will be compatible with it. The software must include computationally efficient techniques for generating and rendering all required imagery. Novel terrain-texture mapping techniques and techniques for implementing coordinate transformations (in six degrees of freedom) are also required in order to assure that high fidelity will be achieved with minimal hardware in all future implementations of the system. In order to assure that it will be feasible to implement any required novel techniques on a PC-based system, functioning software that displays a simple height map surface and allows user selectable movement about the generated (untextured) scene in six degrees of freedom will be delivered under Phase I, along with a technical report.","Phase II will result in a prototype image generator system based on the hardware and software design completed in Phase I and a final technical report.

Finally, all hardware and software should be sufficiently documented such that a preliminary evaluation of the prototypes can be carried out at selected operational sites to be identified during Phase I.

Additionally, the high acceleration of today's fighter aircraft and the resulting requirement for positive pressure breathing have increased the fit problem, leading to compromises in both performance and comfort. The current sizes of oxygen masks used in high performance aircraft were developed to fit male anthropometry and probably do not adequately fit a large portion of the female population. In addition, current mask designs are uncomfortable for many individuals. If aircrew are unable to acquire a proper fit with the current masks, their safety could be compromised. The current method for producing custom oxygen masks for individuals is a very time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Consequently, there is a need to develop a new method to custom fit individuals with oxygen masks which seal under positive pressures as high as 60 mm Hg. Currently, custom masks are made by forming a plaster cast of the individual's face. This is an uncomfortable process for the subject and is tedious for the technician doing the work. A new custom mask-making process should involve a more automated approach to acquiring the anthropometric data on each individual. If data could be obtained to create a computer file for a custom mask, current rapid prototyping technologies may permit production of an individual custom-fit mask. It is desirable to automate custom mask production to decrease the time and labor necessary for production.

The future air-combat environment is threatened by lasers, used as weapons of war or terrorism, which may directly attack the human visual system. One solution supporting continued operations in this future air-combat environment is the use of closed crew stations. The closed crew station was originally described in the Air Force's Project Forecast II. In addition to supporting operations in hostile environments, situation awareness may be enhanced within a closed crew station even when used in a less hostile environment. The closed crew station not only requires real-time synthetic vision, audition, and haptic displays, but also the ability for the human to comprehend and interact with the information. Closed crew station display and control concepts can be driven from two perspectives: either from a human-centered perspective or from a hardware perspective.

Presently, all flyers must meet long standing entrance requirements for body size. New training aircraft will accommodate a much broader range of occupant sizes. This expanded flying population will eventually fly ejection seat-equipped aircraft. This has generated a requirement for novel methods of providing restraint and harnesses, improved effectiveness in seat adjustability, control of aerodynamic loads to optimize these forces for the wide range of occupant weights, and recording of the seat response during an ejection. Contractors' proposals may address one or more of these issues related to advanced escape technologies. An integral part of these new requirements for the expanded aircrew population is the need to identify, develop, and test restraint and parachute harness systems which are compatible with an adjustable seat to better fit the expanded population range in escape systems. This research should examine the design of the restraint and harness system and the attachment points to the seat as well as innovative techniques for adjusting the ejection seat within the cockpit. The technique should allow the expanded range of occupants to be located within the cockpit for proper vision while maintaining acceptable arm and leg reach envelopes. Contour and adjustability of the seat bucket and cushions shall also be examined to determine the adjustments required to provide support and comfort for the expanded population. Closely associated with these new restraint and seat adjustment designs is the need to measure the actual ejection events by some type of ""in seat"" instrumentation package. The package needs to be a small battery-operated data recorder/analyzer that uses internal sensors and attaches to the ejection seat. The collected data will be used to validate and improve the design of the ejection seat and restraint mechanisms in an attempt to reduce future injuries and deaths during ejections from aircraft.

One problem that is impeding the more wide-spread use of these methods is the lack of easily applied electrodes. Electrode applications that require skin preparation in order to achieve acceptable impedances take too long in operational settings. In operational settings, electrodes must be quickly applied, have low impedance and not add noise to the biological signals. Rapidly applied electrodes that require no skin preparation, yet are capable of providing high quality signals are needed for these applications. Electrodes are required that do not cause skin irritation with repeated use from day-to-day and can be used without problems during continuous operations over long periods of time. They should produce data of excellent quality that is immune to artifacts caused by movements, sweating, or drying out over extended use and are immune to environmental electrical noise. Active electrodes that are small and inexpensive could be developed. They must be capable of being worn under helmets, caps and other clothing and must be acceptable to the wearer.

For several reasons these standard techniques are either inefficient or sensitive to vibrations and not suited to military environments.

In operation, the direct view prism disperses the spectrum on the infrared focal plane array. Independent samples are taken by rotating the prism and storing the frame data in a digital computer. The dispersed data are accumulated with over sampling, usually taking at least two samples per desired spectral band.

The focus of this program is the elimination of design constraints that restrict the full implementation of structures. Composite structures are recognized for their superior mechanical performance.

Further mass reductions must come from innovative system designs that integrate required subsystem interface functions into the structure while using these more efficient materials.

To comply with the restrictions and ensure a successful mission, electronics have been required to be packaged in hermetic, ceramic packages to prevent outgassing, and to prevent moisture from being introduced into the circuitry prior to launch. The high cost of space missions can be partly attributed to the cost of special electronics packaging to insure hermeticity of electronic components.

The process of measuring electrical current and voltage responses at particular points within electrical systems or subsystems requires that the desired information be transmitted from the measurement point to a suitable recording device. It has long been known that adding an electrically conducting wire or cable will likely change the electrical characteristics of the quantity being measured. The presence of additional conductors changes the electromagnetic topology of a particular configuration, and the effect becomes more pronounced as the frequency of the incident radiation increases. In measurements in nuclear electromagnetic pulse simulators and in microwave measurements up to 1 GHz, it has been common to use specialized, analog fiber-optic (F-O) transmit/receive links to connect the measurement point with the data recording device. The current capability of field-worthy F-O links with useful signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) is 1 GHz (signal is 3 dB down). More experimental units with increasingly poor SNRs claim to work up to the neighborhood of 10 GHz. A great amount of microwave response measurements are currently being made between 1 and 10 GHz. It is expected that more interest will be displayed in the 10-20 GHz band in the near future.

Innovative electro-optics developments have wide applicability in both defense and industrial applications. For example, the development cycle and cost for new energetic fuel additives and advanced propulsion hardware could be significantly reduced if the benefits of laboratory sized laser- based optical diagnostics were available in rugged, compact form. This capability could be designed into propulsion devices at the prototype stage to provide in-situ optimization of fuel mixture ratio, detection of abnormal ablation, and monitoring of exhaust pollutants.

Similarly, this technology could be applied to automobile, diesel and marine internal combustion engines. Their low cost would also facilitate use in industrial applications for monitoring stack emissions from power plants and chemical manufacturing plants to name only two of an almost unlimited range of possible applications.

This rocket has a theoretical capability of inserting into higher orbits, about twice the payload of current OTVs and will be reusable. The OTV consists of two energy collecting and focusing concentrators which direct sunlight into two small apertures. Within the apertures, are heat exchanging mediums, through which hydrogen gas, our propellant, flows. The hydrogen picks up heat, expands, and thrust is produced out the propulsive nozzle. For our missions, we must keep the package volume and weight of the OTV to a minimum. This means using thin film inflatable concentrators and structural supports as much as possible. They are made of thin film polyimide and are shaped like clamshells or balloons, depending on the type. Both types have a clear light transmission area and a reflectorized light collection area. Micrometeoroids can penetrate the thin film materials easily, leaving larger holes upon exit than on entrance. The concentrator's useful life will be of longer time duration if they can patch themselves instead of having to be replaced every other mission or so. Other components required for the solar rocket include but are not limited to: concentrators, thrusters, energy storage/propulsion bi-modal systems, propellant tankage, space sun-trackers, optical quality measurement devices, and laser beam power thrusters. The latest technologies in Solar Thermal Propulsion concentrator components deal with focusing laser light into apertures from ground-based systems; developing, designing and fabricating foam inflation/rigidized structures for supports; and composite material telescoping supports that are lightweight, package-able in small volumes, and self-deployable.

They can eliminate the need for electro-mechanical safe and arm devices and mechanical latching relays that are used in today's ordnance firing circuits. The LIOS also eliminates the conventional electroexplosive device (EED) which is sensitive to premature initiation from radio frequency, electromagnetic and electrostatic environments. Commercial and military space launch vehicles and satellites use explosively initiated devices to effect numerous events from lift-off to orbit. These explosives devices are electrically initiated by way of electro-mechanical switching networks. A typical launch vehicle and satellite uses at least 70 explosively initiated events to get into proper orbit. The majority of these are redundant; therefore, 80 explosive initiations can occur from engine ignition and lift-off to final appendage deployments in orbit. At the extreme, NASA's space shuttle uses more than 400 explosive events from lift-off through deployment and release of their drag parachute on landing. Today's technological advances indicate that upgrading existing systems to use solid state control circuits and laser initiated explosive devices can enhance performance and effect cost savings.

Clearly, such large increases in the absorption cross sections allows the design parameters of the spectroscopic system to be relaxed, or alternatively, allows for a single high brightness laser source to be multiplexed to several monitoring locations. In a similar vein, accessing wavelengths in the UV-visible allows for laser induced fluorescence (LIF) methods to be used, which, inherently, are high sensitivity methods of detection. Many recent improvements in near-IR semiconductor diode technology [2,3],including beam quality, stability, and power have now made it possible to use these lasers as optical pumps in various nonlinear optical systems to include difference frequency generation [4], second harmonic generation [5], and optical parametric oscillators. Further, the development of improved nonlinear materials [6] parallels the evolution of improved semiconductor pump lasers. Given these technological advances it is desirable to research and develop a compact and relatively rugged diode-pumped nonlinear source to access either the mid-IR or the UV-vis. The generated beam power and quality must be suitable to perform spectroscopic analysis, monitoring or detection of environmental pollutants, process control chemicals, and/or species of importance in atmospheric chemistry or in combustion processes.",288,2009,1,No,No,No,,"Select a diode source for integration into a nonlinear optical system.

The most prominent sensors are real beam and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and forward-looking infrared (FLIR) systems. Although these sensors have been in the inventory for some time, there is no fieldable capability to perform aided or autonomous target recognition (ATR) to augment this large investment. The benefit of new or upgraded sensors has not been quantified. Desert Storm experience suggests that strategic targets will employ extensive camouflage, concealment, and deception to avoid detection. To overcome this difficulty, synergy among the various sensors must be exploited. The Air Force wishes to demonstrate cueing a FLIR sensor with standoff low resolution SAR detections on the F-15E augmented with LANTIRN. Although the observables and characteristics of radio frequency and electro-optic sensors are radically different, there remains one underlying constant: both sensors observe the same target geometry and associated material properties. This project will examine methodologies for fusion of multi-spectral sensor information through reference to a single geometric description of the target object. Elements of this research are (1) resource allocation and directed vision, (2) fusion for ATR, and (3) multi-sensor simulation in Khoros. Resource allocation and directed vision will develop detection prioritization methodologies associated with decision level fusion.

After approximately locating the target in this mode, the TTR switches to the tracking mode to illuminate the target for the missile which is then launched. If the radar could be successfully jammed before the mode switch, it could be prevented from ever launching its missile. Currently, EW systems are not able to recognize a threat in the acquisition mode quickly enough and transfer pertinent information such as frequency and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) to the jamming subsystem so that the appropriate EW technique can be transmitted in time. It is not feasible or desirable to jam all signals in the band at all times. This effort is intended to develop a nonconventional approach to quickly sorting or tagging only the signals in a radio frequency (RF) spectrum that are associated with radars in the acquisition mode. The jammer can then generate waveforms that are already known to be effective against acquisition radars. The conventional approach of measuring the radar signal parameters and maintaining a track file on each threat is probably too slow for this application since a modern TTR can typically complete the acquisition mode before the identification process is finished. The Air Force is looking for technology that will separate the RF pulses of interest from the rest of the spectrum in as close to real-time as possible with a minimal error rate. The technology of interest here is specifically that of sorting or ""filtering"" a portion of the microwave spectrum so that only signals from TTRs in the acquisition mode remain for further processing.

However, MBE process yield limitations are brought about by the high sensitivity of epitaxial layer properties to growth conditions and the inability to control growth conditions adequately. Present MBE technology relies on the inference of important growth parameters from indirect sensor signals and previous calibration data, together with the often unfulfilled hope that growth conditions will not drift appreciably, both within a given growth run or from run-to-run.

New structural design and analysis methods needed to support the development of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). The objective is to reduce the design cycle time and to simultaneously optimize performance parameters to meet increasingly stringent design and affordability requirements. Design methods are needed to address the integration of aerodynamics (including recent development in computational fluid dynamics) and flight controls in the context of aircraft structural design optimization.

The impact of conceptual design and preliminary design on the weight, cost, and signature of structures is significant. Low cost concurrent engineering optimization methods are needed to fuse performance requirements with producibility and supportability requirements. New design and analysis methods are needed for smart structures with embedded sensors, actuators, and processors for structural health monitoring and damage detection, radio frequency antenna performance, and active vibration and structural shape control, including optimization of compliant mechanisms.

Although some laser protection filter technology has been developed against this potential threat, the implementation of such ""protection"" necessitates making restrictive compromise and trade-offs in the design of cockpit related hardware. Use of filters, for example, that can scatter, reflect, deflect, or absorb directed laser energy will also adversely affect the pilot's ability to view the outside world, as well as electronic cockpit instruments.

The proposal is expected to include graphical representation of the stress solutions from a 2-D BEM analysis of the following problem for a (0 degree/90 degree)s graphite-epoxy laminate (E11=20 Msi, E22=E33=1.5 Msi, G12=G13=0.8 Msi, G23=0.48 Msi, v12=v13=0.3, v23=0.55, a1=-0.4 x 10-6 deg F, a2=a3=15 x 10-6/deg F): the laminate has a width to thickness ratio of 10, is constrained to have zero strains in the 0 degree direction (plane strain), and is exposed to a uniform thermal change of -l00 degrees F. Each layer must be modeled discretely. The stresses should be plotted as functions of the ratio (distance from a free edge)/width, showing clearly the extreme and dissipation of boundary layer effects. All non-zero interlaminar stresses should be plotted for a 0/90 deg interface, while nonzero in-plane stresses should be plotted for thickness coordinates lying immediately adjacent to the interface on both sides.",274,1799,1,No,No,No,,"Development expertise in the boundary element method shall be demonstrated by obtaining the interlaminar stress solutions depicted graphically in reference [1] for a (0/90 deg)s graphite-epoxy laminate loaded in tension.

The contractor shall, in addition, demonstrate the capability of developing 3-D analyses of laminated bodies having anisotropic layers, interacting cracks and arbitrary geometries, according to the Phase II criteria stated below.","A 3-D analysis method meeting all of the criteria stated below shall be developed, and the solutions and computer code shall be delivered to WL/MLBM. Comparisons with the in-house method shall be performed for elastic bolt-loaded, 30-ply composites with multiple, interacting cracks. Solutions to certain additional problems arising from the WL/MLBM in-house research programs addressing bolted joints and bonded joints shall be required. The computer program shall meet the following requirements: 1. The 3-D stresses and strains at arbitrarily specified points and the potential and strain energies of the body are the required outputs. 2. Joints are constructed of laminated composite materials; each lamina shall be discretely modeled, i.e., modeling using effective laminate properties is not permitted. 3. Certain 3-D anisotropic elasticity solutions, specified by WL/MLBM, involving free edges in composite laminates shall be recovered by the model. Comparisons of execution times versus finite elements shall be required for a limited number of these solutions. 4. Bolted joints shall include a countersunk bolt-loaded hole with clamping stresses; elastic deformation of the bolt shall be treated and the contact zones shall be correctly evaluated. 5. Multiple, interacting cracks shall be included as discrete traction-free surfaces. 6. The program shall be readily adaptable to arbitrary geometries and loadings. 7. The program shall be implemented on a deskside-type workstation and have an execution time practical for engineering designers in the field, for laminates comprised of no fewer than 30 plies of arbitrary orientations. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: The potential exists for a user-friendly, interactive BEM computer code that can accurately predict progressive damage and failure of composite bolted joints of arbitrary geometries, and can aid in load-carrying assessments of bonded joints. As conceived, the end product will be a powerful analysis tool with wide applicability and high demand in the commercial and military aerospace industries, as well as in other industries where composites are utilized, such as automotive, marine and sporting goods.",,0,"N.J.

Organic materials have the advantage of exhibiting extremely fast NLO response times compared to their inorganic counterparts; in addition, organic materials can be processed with greater ease and versatility for use in more diverse applications. These materials could potentially be used in a number of Air Force applications including optical computing/guidance systems for aircraft and optical network communication applications.

Retention of the second-order NLO electro-optic properties (and thus orientation) should be demonstrated to show the orientation which is induced remains once the source of the orientation is removed.

The first step is to encode current understanding of how each input of the process affects the outputs, which may require one or more linear or non-linear models. Once invoked the performance of these models are monitored by a control system supervisor model, which is capable of constructing a model from empirical data.

Active magnetic bearings represent an innovative approach to aircraft engine rotor support with the potential of providing significant benefits not possible with conventional rolling element bearings.

Additionally, probabilistic design can optimize components to be robust yet lightweight and can reduce costs when applied to the manufacturing and inspection process. While specialty programs have been developed for probabilistic design, they are generally hard to use, do not work with commercially available analysis codes, and their transition into the aerospace industry and community is therefore difficult. To promote more widespread use of probabilistic design in aerospace, a more general purpose computer code is needed. This probabilistic analysis and design code should be rapid, easy to use, accurate, and most importantly, compatible with commercially available finite element analysis codes. The aim therefore is to develop a computer program which can be integrated with a material modeling software and an existing commercial general-purpose finite element (FE) structural analysis computer program (e.g., ANSYS, NASTRAN) to form a general-purpose FE-based probabilistic computer program for large-scale nondeterministic structural analysis and design of gas-turbine engines. The probabilistic package would provide the basis for modeling uncertainties, computing probabilities and performing sensitivity analyses; the material modeling software would provide the means to interface with commercially available or user defined material databases and life prediction algorithms; and the FE software would provide the necessary computational framework for analyzing complex structures. The probabilistic package would then be capable of performing reliability and sensitivity analyses at component and system levels for non-normal dependent random variables and random fields using first-order second-moment methods, first-/second-order reliability analysis methods, response surface methods and simulation methods.

Most existing laser radar systems rely on one of two schemes for finding the distance to an object; either a pulsed detection scheme which measures the photon-time-of-flight or a coherent detection scheme which measures the radio frequency beat noise of two interfering optical signals. Generally, these systems operate with a single element detector (or a linear array of such elements) combined with a scanning laser beam to assemble an image. Each of these systems has several drawbacks which limit their applications, particularly in areas where cost is of concern. One challenge is that the receiver must have a large dynamic range as the returned signal falls off as 1/R2 (in the best case), where R is the range to the object being imaged. This problem is exacerbated as the reflectance from various objects can range from 5% to 95%. Current direct detection systems tend to have limited range resolution (inches) and are often limited by background noise, while current coherent systems tend to be complex and expensive. The use of a scanner often limits the data rate of the system as well as the environment in which it can be used. The area which can be searched by a system is limited by the required resolution and the data rate of the system. Although these two basic designs concepts dominate the laser radar field, several variants of these systems as well as other system concepts are feasible. The goal of this topic is to explore and develop laser radars based on principles which promise a substantial performance improvement and/or cost reduction. Approaches which can increase the dynamic range of the receiver or can improve the range or angular resolution are of interest. Systems which take advantage of mass-produced detector technology (such as Change Coupled Device, CCDs) or which rely on previously unexploited optical properties (such as wavelength dependent properties) are also of interest. One possible example is to use modern, solid state technology to implement low cost coherent systems. An additional example is to use a laser radar that operates at tow wavelengths in the near infrared and ratios the returns at different wavelengths to increase the signal to noise. Yet a third example would be the implementation of a coherent receiver utilizing a CCD camera as the detector.",400,2471,1,No,No,No,,Phase I of this project would demonstrate the feasibility of the detection technique in a controlled environment. An investigation into the applicability of the technique to specific problems may also be appropriate.,"Phase II would consist of the construction of a fieldable laser radar system which operates on the principles explored in Phase I. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: This project would add new capabilities in the laser radar field that would benefit both the military and commercial industry, particularly in areas where current systems can not be used. A system with improved range resolution would enable automated parts inspection for manufacturing, as well as having possible medical applications for the measurement of burns and incisions. A scannerless system could enable the acquisition of data through fibers, which would allow remote inspection of cavities, crevices, and other structures.",,0,"W.L. Wolfe and G.J.

The performance of commercially available components in these spectral regions does not compare with that available from visible components and severely limits the applications which can be attempted. The following three areas illustrate the limitations faced in the near-to-mid IR region: lasers, avalanche photodiodes, and optical filters. Mid-IR lasers are useful sources of optical power in applications where highly monochromatic, highly collimated optical sources are required. Currently, commercially available lasers at wavelengths of 1.4 microns or longer operate whether at low-power (less than 1 W average power) or at low-repetition rates (cw or less than 1000Hz). Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are useful detectors of optical signals in applications where both a high responsivity and a fast response time are needed. Currently, APDs have a limited range of wavelengths in which they are useful(less than 1.7microns). Silicon-based APDs are limited to operation below 1.1 microns. In GaAs based APDs can be extended performance out to 1.7 microns; however, they have much lower responsivity compared to Si. No APDs sensitive past 1.7 microns are currently available. Optical bandpass filters are useful in applications where it is necessary to reduce unwanted optical noise around a particular wavelength. Currently, monochrometers can be used to obtain a band pass of less than one nm; however, they are prohibitively large and have too low a throughput for many applications. Compact bandpass filters are also available with a FWHM (full width half max) of 5 to 10 nanometers and peak transmission of less than 50 percent. The performance of these components needs to be improved as they severely limit the systems which can be produced. The goal of this topic is to develop component technology in the following areas: lasers with pulse repetition frequencies exceeding 10kHz, pulse lengths of 10 ns or less, and average powers exceeding 2W; APD diodes sensitive at wavelengths greater than 1.5 microns with high responsivities (on the order of Si) and rise times on the order of 1 nanosecond or less; and compact bandpass filters with a bandpass of 1 nm or less and peak transmittance of greater than 50 percent.",373,2416,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I of this SBIR task would be to demonstrate the feasibility of a component with the appropriate characteristics, and to produce a system design for a phase II construction.

The final units could be coupled to other IR components to form a simple ranging system, or combined with more complex hardware to create systems which can monitor atmospheric constituents. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: This project would fill a gap in current component capabilities that would benefit the military and commercial industry. An increase in the repetition rate for mid-IR lasers would allow systems using these lasers to operate in a real time eyesafe mode, while an optical filter with FWHM of 1 angstrom would dramatically increase the signal to noise ratio of systems based on current technology. An increase in the gain-bandwidth product for a detector in mid-IR would revolutionize several applications by reducing the requirements on laser power for many applications.",,0,"W.L. Wolfe and G.J.

It differs, however, in that an array of very sensitive millimeter-wave detecting elements is substituted for the film or photographic plate. A more significant difference is that a passive millimeter-wave camera can take pictures both day and night under conditions such as dense fog that would blind an ordinary camera. Current passive millimeter-wave cameras proposed for Autonomous Landing Guidance of commercial and military aircraft will be typically quite large and expensive. Since these systems will be installed in relatively fast moving aircraft, they must produce images at fairly high rates. There is, however, a vastly larger market, both military and commercial, for low cost all-weather, day/night imaging systems that need not take pictures at such a high rate. Some of these are inland water-way navigation; base, post, yard, and industrial complex security and surveillance; all rail, light aircraft, and highway transportation; and fire fighting. It's notable that these applications extend world wide. There are over a hundred thousand brush and forest fires in the United States alone each year with over thirty percent greater than ten acres in extent. A passive millimeter-wave sensor could allow pilots to see through dense smoke and flames so that they could fly and deposit fire suppressant materials directly on the sources of the flames. A further example of the remarkable penetrating power of passive millimeter-waves is that hot spots can be imaged through the walls of burning structures. These images could be used to greatly enhance fire fighting and search and rescue strategies. The derived goal for this SBIR program is to design and develop a very low cost, compact, passive millimeter-wave imaging sensor which addresses as many of the aforementioned applications as possible.",302,1959,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I of this SBIR program should include justification and rationale for selection of an appropriate detector technology, description of a potential imaging scheme, and a preferred preliminary Phase II, overall system design.","Phase II should include building a prototype, proof of principal, passive millimeter-wave camera which can satisfy the low frame rate imaging requirements for at least several of the applications discussed above.

Presently, weeks of work is involved setting up Styrofoam and wood panels in an arena around the warhead under test. Each panel is carefully placed around the test item and instrumented to measure velocities. After the warhead is detonated each panel is analyzed to determine the number, size, and velocity of all fragments that passed through it. The area is carefully searched for fragments. All fragments discovered are weighed and analyzed. New technology is sought to greatly speed this process by providing fragmentation characteristics data in near real-time, without the labor intensive process in use today. The next objective is to reconstruct the flight path, attitude, and aim point of an instrumented airborne imaging unit based on images of the ground transmitted or recorded from a small aerial sensor. The airborne imaging unit may have high spin rates (on axis), wobble, or precision. To complicate the problem, the aerial unit will have minimal internal navigation or guidance systems to provide TSPI (Time, Space, and Position Information) data. Since the images will be gathered at video frame rates, the dynamics of the unit must be modeled in order to fill the gaps between successive images. A limited number of GPS (Global Positioning System) surveyed landmarks and DMA (Defense Mapping Agency) mapped areas will be collected per image and used as the ground reference data. The desired technology will be required to process monoscopic images with minimal image overlap. The required outputs of the process will be the trajectory, the aim point along the ground track, and the attitude of the imaging unit projected into a 3-dimensional representation.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: This project addresses technology that would benefit commercial industry and the military. This technology would aid in performing automobile safety crash tests, studies to reduce damage from terrorist bombs, and in developing explosives techniques for mineral exploration and mining operations. Additionally, this technology would aid in aerial mapping by allowing the use of low cost RPVs (Remotely Piloted Vehicles) with limited internal navigation or guidance systems to be used instead of a more costly airborne platform.

A possible solution to this problem is the potential decomposition and/or neutralization of these toxic agents due to incendiary effects or explosively induced combustion reactions. The end product of this effort will provide a useful analytical tool for the safety and structural engineer as well as for the military planner for prediction of CBW agent release, venting, and atmospheric entrainment, as well as any agent decomposition and/or neutralization brought about by combustion of these agents. The development of a simplified physics-based model to describe these phenomena will provide an effective method of assessing the potential environmental effects of attacking WMD targets with existing and future weapons. Current predictive methodologies, with respect to agent release, are semi-empirical in nature and fail to accurately address the agent venting/entrainment problem. Current combustion models are based on liquid petroleum-based products and are focused on determining the target ignition conditions which must be met to achieve sustained combustion. The existing methodologies can not deal with liquid chemical/biological agents and do not allow for the treatment of dry compounds. These methodologies also do not characterize agent volatilization, neutralization or decomposition by- products.

Today's weapon systems, such as LANTIRN (LWIR) and ASRAAM (MWIR) are using Focal Plane Array (FPA) technologies. The capabilities and limitations of these and other systems must be tested. The IR measurement test community today calibrates single element or sprite scanning imagers with typical Instantaneous Fields Of View (IFOV) of 0.7 milliradian. Current weapon FPA imagers have typical IFOVs of 0.1 milliradian. Data measured at a slant range of 5000 feet produces a pixel size of 0.5 feet by 0.5 feet with the items under test, while the measurements instrumentation yields a pixel size of 3.5 feet by 3.5 feet. The measurement data in no way reflects the fidelity and capability of the weapon under test. Given these facts, measurement instrumentation must be developed that meets or exceeds the capabilities of the weapons under test. The task is to develop calibratable LongWave and MiddleWave IR imaging FPA systems capable of absolute infrared measurements.

State-of-the-art in flush fastener and flush fastener installation technology requires automation or hand crafting by skilled manufacturing technicians to achieve installed tolerances nominally within +/-0.0005"" of the surface. On an aircraft production line, added expense is incurred to purchasing close tolerance fasteners to facilitate fewer manhours to achieve the desired tolerances. In the case of a close tolerance fastener, close tolerance refers to the distance from the bottom of the countersink to the top of the fastener. This entails a 100% inspection at the fastener manufacturer's plant that, in turn, increases the cost of the fasteners. Once installed in the aircraft, a quality assurance function must follow the installation to check the installed tolerance. If installed high, nonconforming parts are either shaved to tolerance or removed and another fastener installed that conforms to the specification. This is a particular problem with steel and titanium fasteners as they do not lend themselves to easy grinding or shaving. If installed too low, either an aerodynamic filler may be used to fill the low fastener or the fastener may be replaced.

The current method of managing the radio frequency (RF) bands reserved for government aeronautical telemetry (i.e.1435-1535, 2200-2290 and 2310-2390 MHz) is becoming increasingly less capable of satisfying user requirements. The DoD frequency management community currently uses frequency division multiple access (FDMA) to partition telemetry bands so they can be shared among multiple users.

This method can be characterized as fixed assignment multiple access scheduling. The growing demand for wideband telemetry among aircraft test programs, and loss of spectrum through legislation are beginning to strain the existing access and scheduling methods. Deficiencies with the current methods include low utilization of spectrum, lack of flexibility in satisfying fluctuating demand, limited commonality among user equipment, and limited opportunity for test aircraft to be interoperable across ranges.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: This research could yield important results for the military and commercial sector. If a successful approach is realized, businesses specializing in construction with foam (such as styrofoam cups or pool equipment), could use electromagnetic sources for quality assurance during fabrication/assembly of such products. The Air Force, as well as other DoD agencies, uses EPS target supports extensively in RCS measurements. As radar signature levels of military vehicles become more and more stealthy, efforts must be made to improve measurement facility sensitivity to allow for accurate RCS measurements.

The need exists to determine the profile of the surface ice contamination. An ice contaminated surface can be highly three dimensional and be dry or wet with water.

These problems, involving compressors and synchronous motors, continue to threaten testing operations and the maintenance budget with a significant risk of catastrophic failure. Recent advances in high-speed signal processing techniques have allowed researchers to identify anomalous frequencies in the vibration spectra as fault or no-fault conditions in similar rotating components. These techniques could be used to identify vibratory excitation sources and isolate potentially damaging responses in facility hardware systems. Once demonstrated, these techniques could be extended to health monitoring and detailed analysis of turbine and liquid rocket engine test articles. The objective is to develop advanced signal processing techniques that meet the following criteria in facility applications: (1) be able to identify resonances induced by neighboring equipment (2) be able to distinguish between acoustically and mechanically driven vibration (3) be able to discern electrical faults from mechanical faults in synchronous and induction motors (4) improve the signal-to-noise ratio in conventional facility vibration data (5) include source-point identification (6) and resolve rotor-related responses from anomalous frequencies and/or noise. In addition to the Phase I Final Report, an educational video, in VHS format, describing the project shall be a required deliverable. The video shall include (1) a discussion of the basic science or physics that is the basis for the proposal (2) a discussion of the various techniques considered or used (3) an actual proof of concept demonstration (4) and a discussion of the results and recommendations.

This announcement seeks to alleviate both of these problems. It concentrates on novel, economical technologies for fabricating high quality oxide fibers and coatings compatible with the fibers at very high temperatures. Phase I should demonstrate a reliable, economical approach to fabricating large quantities of high quality oxide ceramic fibers (YAG, alumina, mullite) capable of operating at temperatures near or above 1500 C for extended periods of time. Phase II will concentrate on fabricating and testing composites from the oxide fibers. This will entail development and application of fiber coatings capable of protecting these fibers at temperatures up to 1500 C, developing economical and compatible oxide matrixes, and mechanical testing at room and elevated temperatures of the produced composites.

The high Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and foaming tendencies of military grade AFFF-contaminated wastewater cause problems with treatment in wastewater treatment facilities. New technologies are being developed to circumvent this problem by physical or chemical remediation. However, as no method exists to determine the level of the compounds, the efficacy and efficiency of these systems cannot be thoroughly tested. As of now, only indirect American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) analytical methods exist for the analysis of contaminants and co-contaminants of AFFF-laden water: BOD, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Benzene Toluene Ethyl Xylene (BTEX), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and simple foaming tests. However, these methods do not accurately represent the concentration of the waste components. In addition to AFFF-laden wastewater, AFFF and its associated compounds present problems when introduced to the subsurface (e.g. contamination of soil and groundwater). Since there is no federally (EPA) authorized analytical protocol for AFFF waste analysis, or for determination of the fate and transport of those components in the atmosphere, or to measure the effects of AFFF components on other associated contaminants, a method to identify, quantify, and measure the fate and transport of those compounds in a given medium must be developed. The formulation of military grade AFFF is a complex proprietary mixture whose perfluorinated surfactant portions may be composed of any combination of various fluorocarbon surfactants. This complex mixture and the foaming tendency of AFFF makes chemical analysis of AFFF and its co-contaminants extremely tedious, if not nearly impossible, by current standard methods. The Air Force requires information on how to detect and measure AFFF components (specifically the fluorocarbon surfactants) and co-contaminants in soils, groundwater, and wastewater. The solvent (which is used as a foam stabilizer) in AFFF, 2(2-butoxyethoxyethanol), is easily measured. However, its presence complicates other analyses. The goals of the Phase I and Phase II proposed research are to: (1) characterize all surfactant and additive components of AFFF including corrosion inhibitors, foam stabilizers, detergents, and fluorocarbon surfactants; (2) identify and quantify the possible biological and chemical breakdown products of these compounds (including the solvent) following oxidative degradation; and (3) develop methods of extraction from soils and groundwater to provide samples to be accurately and precisely tested by the method developed in Goal one. The research must establish the presence of the AFFF components in the presence of other environmental contaminants such as petroleum hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents and dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) (e.g. chlorinated solvents). The research must also address the foaming problem presented by AFFF. The ultimate goal is to be able to use the technique(s) established under this program to measure the components that are of importance to AFFF remediation processes and to make the technique field applicable. Research in Phase I would answer the questions listed above. This knowledge is necessary to develop methods used to identify and quantify AFFF and its components and co-contaminants to: (1) resolve the levels of the compounds in wastewaters, (2) determine their fate and transport in the environment, and (3) understand their persistence in the subsurface. In the Phase II, knowledge gained through this research can be incorporated into a treatment process plan, or verification of such a plan, for fluorocarbon surfactant-contaminated sites and wastewater. Proper interaction with federal, state, and local legal authorities for final approval of the test protocol would also take place in Phase II. Operation should also extend to other applications such as a marketable mobile field kit used to determine the levels of the compounds in a given media. This research would allow a more direct method of the detection of AFFF and its associated compounds both in wastewater and the subsurface. The development of an innovative cost-effective methodology for the detection of these compounds could be used by both government agencies and the commercial sector. The development of a sensory device or an analytical field kit would aid any organization or agency with the detection of AFFF contamination levels in a given medium. Application will extend to treatment of wastewater, reclamation of AFFF, and the prevention of AFFF interference with soil remediation technologies.

AL is conducting mammalian toxicity tests to provide information on bioavailability and toxicity of selected components of weathered jet fuels. The awardee is expected to collaborate with the AL by conducting research to strengthen the toxicology database, and develop software which incorporates the following site assessment capabilities for weathered total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH): 1. cost/benefit analysis for cleanup alternatives; 2. tiered approach for risk assessment and establishing clean-up goals (generic to site-specific); and 3. Federal and selected state regulations. The TPH software is intended for use by environmental professionals such as regulators, consultants, and engineers to support health-risk based decision making (risk management) in determination of site remediation goals for TPH analytes in the environment, and for tutorial and educational purposes. The need is self evident; there is a vast number of government and commercial sites that have environmental problems from historic (and current) use of petroleum based fuels, and there are currently no generally accepted risk-based cleanup standards for weathered TPH.

This oxide and its superior interface with silicon underpins the pervasive CMOS technology. In addition to supporting very high levels of integration, CMOS enables low power circuits. Emerging AF and DOD electronic systems require ever lower levels of power dissipation. At the same time, many of these military applications simultaneously require advanced performance through higher speed/frequency of operation of wider bandwidth. Silicon circuits are unable to supply leading edge requirements of this type. Devices and circuits based upon GaAs and related compound semiconductors are capable of meeting the high speed and bandwith requirements. However, they dissipate more power than corresponding CMOS circuits. A stable, high quality native oxide (or equivalent insulator) has long been sought that would lead to a GaAs CMOS technology.

This is typically done by placing the patient in a sound treated room. These facilities are expensive, bulky, heavy and, as a result, require special installations. Recent work with active noise reduction (ANR) technology has been focused on hearing protection headsets. This technology uses active noise cancellation to effectively block hazardous noise from damaging the hearing of those working in hazardous noise environments. These headsets are quite effective for frequencies extending up to approximately 1000 Hz. Hearing test results are affected most by low-frequency noise. ANR technology should make it possible to test hearing in high noise areas and preclude the use of specialized sound-treated facilities.

Such systems represent a bending of distributive information systems, such as the World Wide Web (WWW) system, and remote operation or manipulation systems, such as those used by NASA in space operations. There is a need to develop new, integrated user-interfaces that can handle information searching, data analysis, and information repackaging while at the same time providing an immersive you-are-there sense of presence to support operation of remotely-located objects. These new interface concepts will serve as the front-end for emerging WWW-based productivity and entertainment products, as well as for new remote operation systems in the military. One approach under consideration for future military operations involves the tactical use of remotely-controlled systems. Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned tactical aircraft (UTA) are planned for development. Highly coordinated user actions involving several remote systems will be required to achieve military objectives. A critical element in the design of a remotely-controlled system needed to achieve this goal is the remote user-system interface. An interface is needed that (1) induces a sense of presence in the engagement area, (2) assists the user in acquiring and updating situation awareness, both locally (single system) and globally (engaging unit), (3) manages information flow and representation , and (4) interprets user commands and control inputs. The user interface for a remote system is envisioned to contain a volumetric visual-audio display and will contain a range of methods for system interaction through manual, gesture, voice, head, and perhaps eye and other forms of control. Complexities associated with information management, system state conditioning, weapons deployment, and integrated task performance present a formidable challenge to the user interface designer.

To this end, there is a current Air Force interest area focusing on expanding the use and battlefield roles of UAVs. One possible scenario involves essentially an unmanned battlespace. Such a scenario requires teleoperation ground control centers for controlling UAVs, where UAVs would perform reconnaissance and surveillance, communication relays, Air Base support, strike, defensive counter air and jamming operations. Since the functions and tasks of ground station personnel would be dramatically different than those performed by contemporary airborne personnel, innovative and immersive VR control center concepts are being considered. However, fundamental human performance research issues involving VR properties have either not been addressed or the data available are limited (e.g., design tradeoffs between VR properties and human performance variables in dynamically interactive synthetic environments). These issues must first be identified and then a VR/human systems interface (HSI) research plan and technology development strategy must be developed to ensure technology maturity for possible VR UAV control center fielding within fifteen years.

This issue is relevant to many realistic decision scenarios, where interdependent team members must coordinate information and/or collaborate in order to achieve successful performance in a primarily intellectual (decision making) task. In this effort, the focus would be on decisions regarding resource allocation. Resource allocation dilemmas are commonplace yet often extremely difficult, whether the context be military battlefield logistics, corporate strategic planning, university research funding distribution, or public service settings. At this time, many team-based decision aids are marketed, but are not amenable to evaluation in that objective measures of successful team performance are usually not available. If measures are available, they are based on behavioral measures of team process (e.g., efficient communication) or team outcomes (correct decision was achieved). What is needed is (a) identification of computer-based technology most likely to enhance team decision processes, and (b) a flexible, team-based task that enables measurement of cognitive as well as behavioral measures of team performance, in order to evaluate the impact of these tools on performance. The software would enable diagnosis of team functioning through examination of team-level cognitive structures and processes. For example, phases of decision making often include stages such as problem formulation and development of shared awareness of the expertise, resources, and interdependencies of all members. Research questions currently being addressed by various investigators include issues such as (a) to what extent does an expert team differ from a novice team with regard to these stages of decision making; (b) how is shared understanding best achieved; and (c) how can computer-based technology (such as artificial intelligence (AI) components, communication structures, etc.) enhance the cognitive processes such as problem formulation and collective awareness across team members. This effort would capitalize on existing knowledge regarding team decision processes and computer-based technology in order to identify computer-based tools and techniques to enhance decision making in teams with members with diverse perspectives.",336,2414,1,No,No,No,,"Development of the team task prototype specifications. Phase I would result in identification of computer-based technology most likely to enhance decision making processes within a resource allocation scenario, particularly when team members have varying expertise. This will be based on a review of current research, with an emphasis on identifying cognitive processes within the team, and the means by which these processes can be enhanced through interventions. At the same time, a team task will be developed that will enable demonstration of the effectiveness of these interventions. The decision support system composed of the team task and corresponding technology will enable team-based decision making for a minimum of three team members using standard networked Pentium class or better platforms running Linux (or other Unix variants). The task would be highly flexible, allowing configuration to a variety of decision scenarios, from military command-and-control to corporate resource allocation dilemmas. The software should enable the study of networked teams of up to 20 members, with the capability of investigating the processes of subgroups within the overall team. Knowledge and performance measures will be generated by the software, to include the assessment of individual and team-level task knowledge, measures of team processes (such as communication and coordination effectiveness), and criterion measures of decision performance. A plan of research will also be produced, in the form of a technical report, delineating the stream of research made possible by this team task, with the objective of identifying strategies, principles, and/or decision aid tools to enhance resource allocation decisions in teams with distributed expertise.","Development, delivery, and demonstration of the team task and technology enhancements.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: Critical resource allocation decisions are made every day throughout military, private-sector corporations, and public agencies by teams comprised of individuals with differing expertise, perspectives, goals, and intentions, yet our understanding of the processes that affect team-based decision making is limited and often anecdotal. The team task itself can be transitioned to research facilities for use in team performance research. More importantly, the tools and techniques identified and developed in this effort can be transitioned for commercial use, such as for technical managers with limited resources.

Yet, information warfare requirements demanded by cognition, collaboration, computation, and context are rarely leveraged in a way that will provide systematic planning, assessment, integration, and design of human system interfaces. Cognitive engineering tools and techniques have been applied to contexts like information warfare but are often unidimensional, woefully under-developed , and applied in piecemeal ways. For example, they may only yield a task-analytical modeling perspective, or may be limited to a singular form of knowledge representation. Often, cognitive engineering is a paper-and pencil exercise, is conducted by a single engineer with a single domain expert, and does not take advantage of advances in computer science (e.g., collaborative computing technologies). Requirements for a cognitive engineering suite for information warfare domains first necessitates the use of collaborative computing to support different types of integrated cognitive engineering processes. Group support systems for cognitive engineering redefine the area as a ""distributed, participatory enterprise"" wherein multiple engineers/multiple experts collectively establish joint assessments and mutual design rationale. Second, integrated cognitive engineering processes must interlock technological capabilities with knowledge-based, observer-based, and case-based modeling to perform analytical `what-if' and design synthesis activities. This highlights the need for intelligent retrieval systems, exploratory sequential data analysis tools, fuzzy logic categorization, case-based reasoning, and/or machine learning systems that can index, represent, and distinguish differences in situated cognition within multi-operator performance. These processes highlight acquisition, exploration, and transformation of operator-centered knowledge throughout different stages of the information warfare systems design.

Optimal implementation of complex systems requires that the human operator is functioning efficiently. Current systems do not have operator-state information even though the operator is a crucial component of the overall system. Operators become inefficient because of mental overload, fatigue, inattention, and boredom. By monitoring operator-state, the controlled system can alert the operator and/or make adjustments to itself to accommodate the level of operator functioning. Human operator state can be monitored by observing their psychophysiological condition and their overt performance. However, this is a new area and tools are not available that make operator-state evaluation practical. A system is needed that accepts psychophysiological and performance data from operators at their workstations, provides a broad selection of analysis and classification tools and yields a highly accurate classification algorithm that can be implemented at the workstation. The system would have capabilities to read the users' data regardless of the format, would provide a number of methods of viewing the data graphically, would make suggestions concerning the most appropriate type of classifier to use, provide easy access to an array of classifiers and would provide evaluation of the success of each classifier.

The system must be very user friendly, provide on-line help functions and use graphical user-interface schemes. A list of background literature should be provided. Analysis speed is very important since the system could be used at the work site.

Presently, all flyers must meet long-standing entrance requirements for body size. New training aircraft will accommodate a much broader range of occupant sizes. This expanded flying population will eventually fly ejection seat-equipped aircraft. This has generated a requirement for novel methods of providing restraint and harnesses, improved effectiveness in seat adjustability, control of aerodynamic loads to optimize these forces for the wide range of occupant weights, and recording of the seat response during an ejection. Contractors' proposals may address one or more of these issues related to advanced escape technologies. An integral part of these new requirements for the expanded aircrew population is the need to identify, develop, and test restraint and parachute harness systems which are compatible with an adjustable seat to better fit the expanded population range in escape systems. This research should examine the design of the restraint and harness system and the attachment points to the seat, as well as innovative techniques for adjusting the ejection seat within the cockpit. The technique should allow the expanded range of occupants to be located within the cockpit for proper vision, while maintaining acceptable arm and leg reach envelopes. Contour and adjustability of the seat bucket and cushions shall also be examined to determine the adjustments required to provide support and comfort for the expanded population. Closely associated with these new restraint and seat adjustment designs is the need to measure the actual ejection events by some type of ""in seat"" instrumentation package. The package needs to be a small, battery-operated data recorder/analyzer that uses internal sensors and attaches to the ejection seat. The collected data will be used to validate and improve the design of the ejection seat and restraint mechanisms in an attempt to reduce future injuries and deaths during ejections from aircraft.

Various designs of fiber-optic chemical sensors have been developed utilizing fluorescence, interference, and absorbance spectral properties. In the most common designs, radiation from the optical bench is carried via fiber-optics to a sample cell or viewing region, and allowed to exit the fiber-optic, interact with the sample, and returning or re-emitted radiation re-enters the fiber-optics for transmission back to the optical bench. An alternative form of fiber-optic spectroscopy uses interactions between the sample, surrounding the fiber-optic, and the evanescent wave of the radiation. Material outside the fiber-optic of an evanescent wave sensor interacts with the evanescent wave and can absorb radiation at wavelengths characteristic of the sample. Since the evanescent wave accounts for only a small portion of the energy of the radiation being carried through a fiber-optic, this form of spectroscopy is not highly sensitive. However, the cladding of the fiber-optic, this form of spectroscopy is not highly sensitive. However, the cladding of the fiber-optic media can absorb external sample material and concentrate it, thus increasing spectral response.

These arrays utilize a collection of gas phase sensors, each with a different response characteristic, to generate a pattern of responses from vapors which enter the sensor array. The individual sensors in the array have different responses to vapors of different compounds and compound mixtures. The pattern of responses can thus be used to identify and classify odors and other vapor mixtures through the use of pattern recognition techniques or artificial neural networks. The individual sensors of the array should yield quantitative responses. Gas phase sensor arrays should be applicable to the detection and classification of spilled fuels and solvents in the air, water, and soils. If the devices can be made with sensitive enough responses to aromatic hydrocarbons, they should also be applicable to the detection of water-soluble fuel components in headspace over groundwater and groundwater samples. Such sensor arrays should be useful for initial environmental site surveying, site characterization, and monitoring. Typical analyte mixtures which may be of interest for the Air Force include fuels (including jet fuels), cleaning solvents (such as trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, methylene chloride, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride), and aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, more highly substituted benzene derivatives, naphthalene, naphthalene derivatives, and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons). Sensors intended for detecting and monitoring these analytes should yield quantitative responses, although the quantitation of individual analytes in mixtures will probably require the use of chemometrics to isolate the response of a desired target analyte from the other compounds in the mixture. There are a variety of ways to utilize gas phase sensor arrays in conducting environmental surveys. Devices may be designed and optimized for examining samples from groundwater monitoring wells, or for use within the wells themselves. Also, it should be possible to combine such sensor arrays with site surveying systems such as cone penetrometers and geoprobes. Gas phase sensor arrays should also be directly useful for detecting and monitoring atmospheric pollutants. The ideal gas phase sensor array for environmental use should include simple and inexpensive sensor elements. The manufacturing techniques used in the sensor and array fabrication should permit the arrays to be reproducibly mass produced with sufficient precision that the responses of duplicate arrays will be reproducible. Such reproducibility will be required in order that neural networks, classification rules, and calibrations developed with one sensor array will be equally valid for all members of the mass produced series. The ideal gas sensor array should also permit simple and easy acquisition of the array's responses and interfacing with computers for data interpretation and chemometric analysis.",436,3028,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will result in the design, proof-of-concept, and technical report fully documenting the gas phase sensor array, including the demonstration of the Phase I prototype in a laboratory setting at the Armstrong Laboratory, Environics Directorate.

For Phase I, it should be sufficient to demonstrate the device with directly introduced gas phase analytes and mixtures. The device should be capable of speciating and quantifying mixtures with small numbers of components (five or fewer), and it should be capable of identifying complex mixtures (e.g., gasoline, jet fuel, or diesel fuel).","Phase II will result in the design and fabrication of a final prototype gas phase sensor array with considerations for mass production and commercialization in Phase III.

Many synthetic learning and training environments contain a mixture of human and computer-generated participants. In order to optimize the effectiveness of the training environment, it is often desirable to introduce, eliminate, or alter in some way the actions of the computer-generated entities. For example, the instructor may wish to reposition computer-controlled entities or change their goals during the execution of a real-time training exercise to force the human players to learn to react to the unexpected. There are a number of instances in which the ability to control the simulated entities ""on the fly"" would result in more effective training. Current capability in this area is extremely limited. The entities are identified and positioned in advance according to prespecified scenario scripts and once the exercise has started, the entities perform in a preprogrammed fashion through the conclusion of the scenario. In addition, current displays depict the location and type of computer-generated entities in two-dimensional plan views. In many training environments, the activity is taking place in three dimensions. A three-dimensional display would aid the instructor or entity controller to more effectively decide when and how to introduce changes to the ongoing training activity. Initial applications would involve control of airborne enemy threat vehicles operating in a multiservice simulated combat scenario.",230,1587,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will result in a system requirements analysis to include computational requirements, networked information transmission requirements, a proposed functional architecture, and estimated time and cost to develop and implement the proposed system.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: The capability provided by this effort will be an asset to all forms of education and training which involves real-time operation of training scenarios in which the behavior of any entity is depicted with a computer-generated, automated (or semi-automated) program. The flexibility afforded by being able to adapt the training environment ""on the fly"" according to the instructional goals and behavior of the human participants should significantly increase the overall training effectiveness. Training of air traffic controllers, assembly line operators, surgical teams, firefighters, and law enforcement teams are examples of application areas that should profit from this technology. Additionally, this capability could be applied to some nonreal-time areas for aiding in the decision making process for rapid prototyping or design work, e.g., highway/traffic flow management and design.",,0,"Dahmann, J.S., Salisbury, M.R, Booker, L.B., Seidel, D.W.

Present job knowledge and skills tests are sometimes criticized by senior non-commissioned officer's (NCO's) for capturing test-taking ability, measuring book knowledge, placing too much emphasis on verbal abilities, and missing pertinent job knowledge. Advances in cognitive task analysis have shown that by placing airmen in contexts of task completion, knowledge that is critical to successful task completion is made salient; background knowledge that is irrelevant is safely ignored. What is really needed is a test development system that creates scenario-based tests that clearly measure airmen's ability to perform within the context of their job. Scenario-based tests will require three phases for test development. The first phase is constructing realistic and representative test scenarios.

New capability needs include: improved low noise amplifiers (1 to 1.3 dB noise figure is desired), dual simultaneous polarization antenna elements, efficient RF power combining circuits, smart control for array antennas that can sense failures and correct or compensate antenna patterns, super-resolution and neural network techniques that can perform accurate direction finding with smaller systems using less accurate, lower cost components, automatic system calibration based upon the use of available beacons, and adaptive cancellation of interference for mobile satellite terminals. These capabilities allow the use of small, low cost radar, and communication antennae and sensors with increased capability due to the flexibility of adaptive digital smart control.

In particular, proof-of-concept, FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)- based, single channel signal energy detectors (i.e., spectrum analyzers) have been implemented which are capable of detecting and ""grouping"" dispersed signal energy to form estimates of the composite bandwidth, center frequency, and signal-to-noise ratios. While multi-channel approaches exist and have many desirable characteristics, these techniques likewise require orders of magnitude increases in implementation complexity, size, maintainability and cost over that of single channel techniques. Similarly, Time-Frequency distribution approaches, while useful in many scenarios, also have rather complex processing requirements. Currently available commercial spectrum/signal analyzers, including those that employ FFT-based Fourier analysis, lack the composite signal grouping, and parameter estimation reporting functionalities. With such capabilities, the enhanced spectrum analyzer becomes an extremely useful RF spectrum characterization device. The ""Adjustable Bandwidth Concept (ABC) Signal Energy Detector"" shows particular promise as a technique for spectral analysis enhancement and is the focus of this research effort. Essentially, this technique allows for the grouping and parameter report generation of signals with various bandwidths within the RF segment analyzed.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: The results of a successful Phase II approach would lead to reliable off-the-shelf structural components which are lighter than current components for use in a variety of commercial ground and space-based applications. In space, inflatable structures have potential uses as communication antennas, radar antennas for remote sensing, telescopes, solar collection for power or propulsion, or for non-load bearing structural parts. Ground-based uses in industry could include rapid prototyping of parts, use as improved packaging or insulating materials, use as a replacement for styrofoam, or use as a buffer between moving parts. Automotive uses such as bumpers or airbags for the outside of cars are also possible, as are a wide range of marine applications, including rapid construction of marine dry-docks, boat hulls, life rafts or lifesaving rings. Recreational uses include inflatable pools, sculptures or decorations, and form-fitting ski boots. Finally, disaster relief applications such rigidizable tents and patches for application to sidewalks or other light-duty structures following earthquakes would be feasible.",,0,"Jouriles. N.

The avionics generate a great deal of heat, and the airframe forms the heat sink necessary to keep the avionics from overheating. As a result, these avionics must be designed and test to very high vibration specifications. This drastically increases the life-cycle cost of such items. If a thermally-conductive vibration isolation system could be developed specifically addressing the unique requirements of the launch environment, potentially lower cost aircraft avionics could be used. Such a system would allow the launch vehicle industry to take advantage of COTS technology, thereby greatly reducing procurement and testing costs. Innovative vibration isolation concepts for launch vehicle avionics are sought. The government desires a performance improvement goal of 20 dB attenuation in the frequency band from 10-500 Hz. Although not required, it is highly recommended that the small business team with a launch vehicle contractor in some fashion. The small business must demonstrate an understanding of the actual technical challenge. Proposers must be cognizant of the fact that their proposed systems will eventually have mass, volume and power constraints. Interest in or acceptance of the technology by a launch vehicle contractor is critical for demonstration of commercialization. The Phillips Laboratory will not provide industry contacts with the LV or avionics contractors. It is the small business' responsibility to develop the necessary relationships with potential industrial partners.",236,1623,1,No,No,No,,"Thoroughly define the problem.

While many research groups have built prototype microrelay devices, they all remain impractical novelties due to problems ranging from ineffective actuation, series loss, and degradation of contact resistance. The problems of dry contacts in macroelectromechanical relays and switching devices are well understood, yet seemingly little has been done to improve the understanding of present and prospective instantiations of MEMS-based versions. We seek novel and practical solutions to the development and insertion of microrelay and microswitch devices for space-based digital, analog, radio-frequency (RF), and power electronics applications. As such, we expect offerors to present approaches in their proposals that present extremely low series loss, low contact resistance, high isolation, and very high reliability. It is expected that many dozens or even hundreds of such relays should be able to be constructed within the size of a normal integrated circuit (IC). For RF applications, offerors should address the frequency-dependent performance potential of the devices, discussing any issues that affect their transmission line or full wave behavior (e.g., dispersion, reflection, etc.). For digital applications, moderately low loss and coupling are desired, with high density being of greatest importance. For power applications, series loss is of most direct importance. Finally, for analog (e.g. instrumentation/sensor) applications, signal fidelity and isolation are of the greatest importance. Of course, the space environment must be considered. Various radiation effects (such as total ionizing dose) and temperature range are of great concern here. For example, these switches might be immersed in a cryogenic environment for infrared imaging sensors. Another area of concern is the need for hermeticity or the ability to operate in non-hermetic conditions. If exposed microrelays/switches are indicated, offerors need to consider spacecraft charging/atomic oxygen/contamination issues. Of course, disadvantages in one sense become advantages in other cases. To expand the range of possibilities, we would welcome creative exploitation of the weaknesses of microrelays. For example, exposed micro-relays could be used to monitor degradation of contacts in a meaningful way, so as to glean useful information (perhaps) regarding its operating environment.",357,2530,1,No,No,No,,Efforts should define and validate models of prospective microswitching devices. It may be within the realm of reason to attempt to construct a prototype through a supported foundry such as MCNC.,"Efforts would need to address more demonstrably the performance and long term reliability of practical devices in space environments. It is minimally expected that the contractor develop and deliver fully functional arrays of devices which should be packaged and demonstrated to perform reliably in the space environment.

High performance, under the above conditions, requires lattice-matched substrates with low defect densities (less than 5 X 10E5 defects per sq. cm) and very low impurity concentrations (less than 10E14 impurities per cu cm). Currently available substrates are of limited size (typically on the order of 15 to 24 sq. cm), which severely limits the number of large format arrays which can potentially be formed on these substrates. In addition, while substrates can be screened reasonably for flatness and crystal quality (including defect density), too often the substrates are found to be the source of fatal contamination after considerable expense and effort of growth, fabrication, and testing of detector array lots. The development of LWIR array technology for low background applications would be facilitated greatly by the ready availability of large, lattice-matched, high-purity substrates. The Air Force is seeking innovations which would make available the high-quality substrates as described above to all MCT developers. In addition to addressing the above needs, it is very important that any approach include: 1) the development of cost-effective detection and screening techniques to identify material contamination at very low levels from receipt of source material through the entire substrate fabrication process, and 2) process improvements to ensure the purity of the final delivered substrates.",246,1701,1,No,No,No,,Develop preliminary processing and material screening steps to select most promising implementations.

The contractor shall deliver four substrates to the government for independent evaluation and shall develop plans for process/screening insertion into commercial substrate fabrication production lines. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: The processes/screening techniques developed will support all long wavelength infrared focal-plane array imaging based on mercury cadmium telluride detector array technology. Commercial uses of this technology include remote detection, identification, and tracking of airborne pollutants emanating from industrial plants, and space-based earth and atmospheric condition imaging for environmental monitoring and natural resource assessment and management. The latter applications are now a multi-billion dollar industry worldwide which requires many high-performance arrays. Current capabilities are limited by array cooling requirements and performance capability. The results of this SBIR effort would enable much greater capability and flexibility by making available larger, higher performance arrays which would directly translate into reduced satellite power and array cooling requirements and broader spectral and spatial coverage for each array. The latter would be accomplished with greater detail than presently available, significantly enhancing the value of the products currently being marketed.",,0,"Johnson, S.M., et al.

Expert systems provide good tools for known satellite anomalies when knowledge is available. For unknown anomalies, a system must reason based on how the system works (model-based reasoning) and/or on the history of the system (case-based reasoning). Input to the reasoning system is satellite real-time health and status data captured from monitoring satellite telemetry and models of the spacecraft systems. The output is anomaly determination and resolution assistance presented to the satellite operator. What form this assistance takes must be determined, but may include recommendations, schematics, simulations, history, etc. Computation must be timely to meet real-time requirements of satellite operations. Case-based reasoning potentially speeds anomaly resolution by recalling solutions to similar problems seen in previous experience. The utility of a case-based reasoning system is greatly enhanced if machine learning techniques are used to capture pertinent characteristics of the current problem and its eventual solution. Otherwise, if no learning capability exists, a case base must be derived from some other source. Model-based reasoning is advantageous for solving unknown anomalies because component models can identify non-working components despite the failure mode. A significant problem in implementing a model-based diagnosis system is finding appropriate models; a significant opportunity for solving this problem is to capture design information (e.g., CAD schematics in popular file formats) and use it to generate models automatically. Identifying the correct level of abstraction for the model is also an important challenge and can impact the real-time performance, certainly a consideration for telemetry anomaly resolution in real-time. Consideration should be give to the accuracy of the reasoning system developed. Verification is difficult for complex software, but some metrics of goodness will be necessary before widespread acceptance of the technology can be expected.",299,2138,1,No,No,No,,"Address whether model-based and/or case-based reasoning or some combination is best suited for unknown anomaly resolution, how it should be implemented into a satellite control system, and how accuracy is verified.

The technology sought should address sources capable of delivering gigawatt levels of power in microsecond or shorter pulses. Both narrow and wide band sources are of interest. The technologies that may be addressed in this effort include pulsed power, high power microwave tubes, transmission lines, mode converters, and antennas. Also of interest are methods and techniques for measuring the performance of these components, the effects that such environments will have on electronic systems, and methods of protecting systems from electromagnetic environments over a wide range of frequencies and field levels. Protection against electromagnetic effects is becoming critical with the increased use of electronics, lower power semiconductors with reduced noise immunity thresholds, reduced shielding through increased use of plastics and composite materials, and increased RF emissions from commercial and military radiators. The increased use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment in military systems will also require improved protection approaches to effectively use COTS without major redesign and expense. Application of electromagnetic technologies for other areas such as security systems, law enforcement, medicine, and information systems are also of interest. In addition to the application of electromagnetic protection to satellites, additional protection is needed for other threat environments such as radiation, thruster firings, space debris, orbit dependent chemical reactions with naturally occurring species, and solar or laser radiation. Many of these environments are natural or occur during normal operations, but others may be threats faced by satellites during a wartime situation.

Protection of future electronic systems is a must in a society with ever increasing dependency on reliable operation of automobiles with airbags, anti-skid brakes, electronic transmissions and steering, and engine control. Fly-by-wire aircraft, information highway systems, and home appliances are among other systems critically dependent on reliable operation of electronic subsystems. Increased use and dependency on satellites for everything from communications, global positioning systems for both military and commercial aircraft, weather information, and many other applications, combined with the high cost and difficulty of repair require that these systems be designed to protect them from threat environments both during normal operation and in case of wartime to protect our interests in the world of the future.",,0,"Baker, ""Air Force High-Power Microwave Technology Program"", Aircraft Survivability, published by the Joint Technical Coordinating Group/Aircraft Survivability, Arlington, VA, Fall 1995","Baker, ""Air Force High-Power Microwave Technology Program"", Aircraft Survivability, published by the Joint Technical Coordinating Group/Aircraft Survivability, Arlington, VA, Fall 1995",1,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/60653/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/60653/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,97.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:38:28,,,,,AF97-082_60653,DOD_SBIR_97_P1_C1_AF97-082,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:21.577015+00

In like fashion, linacs for X-rays could replace radioactive 60Co sources for food processing and eliminate the associated NRC licenses, regulating, operating, and capital costs. Similar machines could be competitive in sterilizing waste streams, such as treatment of waste from hospitals. The successful development of such tubes will also make markets in the use of linacs for making deep welds at high repetition rates and for radiology for inspecting deep welds in heavy industries including shipbuilding.

They are also prone to errors and don't allow for unattended operation. A new approach based on electromagnetic technology is desired to provide this type of capability. Its ability to operate in varying weather and lighting conditions would provide advantages over optical methods. Characteristics of such a system should consider the use of some type of special license plate that can be attached to vehicles that would respond when illuminated by an electromagnetic field. The response would be in the form of a radiated electromagnetic field containing vehicle identification information. The license plate should be easily produced, low cost, and perform reliably. A passive (un-powered) license plate which has the capability to receive sufficient energy from the radiated interrogating field necessary to radiate the vehicle information in form of an electromagnetic field is preferred.

Risetimes of interest are in the range of one nanosecond to 10s of picoseconds, and pulse widths as short as a few hundred picoseconds are desired.

Future Air Force and Civilian propulsion systems will operate in high pressure combustion regimes for which there are almost no available diagnostic methods that are reliable and quantitative. Over the last 20 years, a broad spectrum of laser-based optical diagnostic techniques have been developed for remote, non-intrusive measurements in extremely harsh combustion environments, such as gas turbine engines, internal combustion engines, rockets and shock tubes. These proven methods can measure species concentrations, temperature, density, and flow velocity, in many cases acquiring a two-dimensional visualization. Unfortunately, these methods are semi-quantitative or qualitative at high-pressures. But it is precisely this pressure regime that is of critical importance to several strategic technology areas, both military and commercial. Pertinent examples are rocket propulsion, advanced gas turbine technology, internal combustion engines (gasoline and diesel) and supercritical chemical extraction and processing. Many devices would improve performance if operated at higher pressure, therefore, it is imperative that new technology be found to interrogate this difficult, nearly inaccessible regime. The Phillips Laboratory is seeking new and unique diagnostic methods, or innovative application of existing methods such as (but not limited to) the following: emission spectroscopy, line-of-sight absorption, Raman (line-imaged and 2-D), Rayleigh-Brillouin, LIF and PLIF, CARS, Degenerate Four Wave Mixing and other laser-induced transient grating effects, and picosecond pulse methods. Other nonlinear spectroscopic and optical methods may be considered also. In appraising potential methods, particular attention to the exceptional problems unique to high pressure diagnostics, such as beam-steering and scattering, spectroscopic line-broadening and band collapse (encountered in Q-branch Raman and CARS), are considered. High sensitivity is not an overriding issue, rather, accurate measurement of major species, temperature, and density are paramount. An effort must be shown to reduce the size/weight/power demand/cost of the diagnostic instrumentation with the ultimate aim of onboard installation of the diagnostic on the combustion device. Similarly, consideration must be given to operation of the diagnostic under conditions of multiphase combustion and/or flow. Such multiphase considerations are necessary of liquid rocket engines and supercritical chemical processing.",358,2737,1,No,No,No,,"Develop and demonstrate the potential of diagnostic methods for measurement of species concentrations, temperature and density of combustion reactants, intermediates, and products relevant to Air Force Propulsion and Energy conversion, under high-pressure, high-temperature, multiphase conditions in harsh environments, including supercritical conditions.

A proof-of-concept demonstration of offeror's high-pressure diagnostic methodology is required.","Develop and demonstrate operation of prototype instrument for high-pressure combustion diagnostics investigated under Phase I. All hardware and software developed under this program shall be delivered. A well-documented strategy for implementation of this technology into Air Force Propulsion Systems and transfer into commercial applications shall be composed. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: Diagnostic instrumentation that provides reliable, accurate data from devices operating at high pressure would impact countless commercial applications. Developers of this diagnostic instrumentation will be immensely successful because of these several marketing opportunities, and should easily foresee a multi-million dollar market potential. As an obvious example, this unique measurement technology is immediately and directly applicable to internal combustion engines and gas turbine propulsion. Stationary power plants provide another example. These vital measurements would be used to increase efficiency and reduce pollutant emission, and eventually may be employed to provide interactive control of operating conditions. The latter application would contribute to longer-lived engines, reduced fuel costs, and higher performance. Another critical utilization for high-pressure diagnostics is in the chemical process industry where high-pressure reactors are routinely employed. Very little fundamental information concerning kinetics, reaction mechanisms, and product distribution for high-pressure reactions is available. Crucial thermodynamic and kinetic data gained from accurate diagnostics would lessen design time and system check-out and would provide better-informed operating strategy. A challenging new extension in this field, operating at very high pressures and high temperatures, is supercritical extraction and synthesis. One of the most important objectives of this technology is the safe conversion of toxic wastes into harmless products. Instrumentation that contributes critical measurements in these devices would improve performance through better design and process operation, making this industry more competitive in the worldwide marketplace.",,0,"Eichler, P.

Theoretically, this rocket has the capability of inserting about twice the payload of current OTV's into higher orbits and will be reusable. The OTV consists of two energy-collecting and focusing concentrators which direct sunlight into two small apertures. Within the apertures are heat exchanging media through which hydrogen gas, the propellant, flows. The hydrogen picks up heat, expands, and thrust is produced out the propulsive nozzle. For AF missions we must keep the package volume and weight of the OTV to a minimum. This means using thin film inflatable concentrators and structural supports as much as possible. These items are made of thin film polyimides and, depending on the type, are shaped like clamshells or balloons. Both types have a clear light transmission area and a reflectorized light collection area. Micrometeoroids can penetrate the thin film materials easily, leaving larger holes upon exit than entrance. The concentrators' useful life will be of longer time duration if they can patch themselves instead of having to be replaced every other mission or so. Other components required for the solar rocket include, but are not limited to: concentrators, thrusters, energy storage/propulsion bi-modal systems, propellant tankage, space sun-trackers, optical quality measurement devices, and laser beam power thrusters. The latest technologies in Solar Thermal Propulsion concentrator components deal with: focusing laser light into apertures from ground-based systems; developing, designing, and fabricating foam inflation/rigidized structures for supports; and composite material telescoping supports that are light weight, packageable in small volumes, and self-deployable.

Due to the extremely cold nature of cryogenic liquids (below -320F) used in rocket propulsion, these liquids easily boil off. The amount of boil off that occurs depends on the propellant used (liquid nitrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen) and the quality of the storage vessel. An accurate liquid level gauge is important in the realm of the boil off. Conventionally, liquid level indicators use pressure measurements to determine the level of cryogen. Turbulent conditions that can occur during filling or a run condition oftentimes result in erroneous liquid level readings. Common practice in cryogenics dictates 5-10% ullage in the storage vessel after a fill. Due to the uncertainty in conventional gauges during turbulent conditions, the actual ullage space is unknown during a fill. During test operations, the pressure on the cryogenic vessel can be raised up to 6000 psi or higher. When this pressure is increased, along with evacuation of the liquid from the vessel, the level indication can read to a 30% error. Uncertainty of the liquid level in the tank could result in a gas flowing to the particular test hardware, damaging the systems, and incurring a large capital cost. Due to the nature of testing, many different cryogenic liquids are used. The most common are liquid nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. Many times a single vessel can be used for all three of these liquids. Each liquid has a different specific gravity, and therefore either three gauges are required, or one gauge needs to be calibrated to the specific liquid at that time. This calibration of the gauge for the different liquids can be time consuming and costly. Development of a cryogenic liquid level indicator that can function under turbulent conditions caused by filling, pressurization, and boil off condition would be beneficial.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: There are very clear commercial applications for a high sensitivity, low cost microaccelerometer. Several areas are: (a) Aircraft Navigation: There is currently an estimated $30-40M business in strapdown Inertial Navigation System platforms for airliners that would utilize improved designs that reduce cost and improve performance. There is also a need for the military industry to develop autonomous navigation for warfighting planes. The B2, F117, and F22 SPO's have requested enhanced inertial navigation systems. Gravity Gradiometers have been proposed to meet this need. The Gradiometers consist of several accelerometers (4-8) mounted on a rotating platform. Consequently several microaccelerometers would be needed for each plane. (b) Commercial Small Satellites: Applications include thrust dynamics, vibration sensing, attitude control and all navigation systems and all new inertial units. The market could include proposed large numbers of deployed systems such as the Iridium satellites. New accelerometers are also a technical need for the Navigation mission area. (c) Exploration Geophysics (oil, gas, mining): Instrumentation is a large part of this big business. Applications include arrays of vibration sensors for seismic reflection studies, borehole logging of gravity signals and local seismicity. A new area that would exploit the new microtechnology is in airborne exploration. Bell Aerospace Corp. is evaluating the feasibility of mineral surveying from an airborne gravity gradiometer system-another area with tremendous growth potential in the civilian sector. (d) Counterproliferation: Gradiometers are being planned to discriminate nuclear from non-nuclear warheads. For stationary monitoring in factories, current technology requires being within a couple of meters of the warhead. 3-D monitoring requires three sets of gradiometers. Since current technology requires large accelerometers, the large mass associated with these sensors means that the mass attraction of the gradiometer itself introduces an error. This error can be greatly reduced with the proposed small microaccelerometer. Mobile gradiometers that can detect underground structures are also being proposed. Closely related to this work are DOE applications which include detection of buried toxic waste sites.",,0,"Elwell, J. ""Progress on Micromechanical Inertial Instruments.""

Use of such laser systems has been restricted to operating rooms, even for procedures that can be performed inside a physicians office. The benefits of semiconductor laser diodes include less expense and more compact laser delivery systems that can output substantial power. Semiconductor technology has the potential to provide wavelengths in the visible to mid infrared regions at powers over 50 watts. This capability opens doors for many minimally-invasive medical applications.

There are distinct advantages to this approach. Providing IR illumination allows covert viewing of a suspicious subject without prompting flight or confrontation. Visible illumination provides rugged, low-power spotlighting for officers without night vision equipment. In the past, small laser diodes (670nm @ 15mw) have been used for targeting weapon systems and for designation. The pin-point spot is often hard or impossible to see at distance and is difficult to keep on a moving target. Law enforcement needs a variable spot size with more power, capable of covering the entire target in laser light, illuminating the target and designating it. For example: A target at 100 meters would require a 2 meter spot size, making the optical divergence of the source at 20mrad's. But at 1000 meters, a 2 meter spot would require optics with 2mrad's. The power required to effectively illuminate and designate a target with the aforementioned spot size is 300-500 milliwatts at 640-660 nanometers for visible, and 300-500 milliwatts at 808-880 nanometers for an IR laser. The IR laser would be used in conjunction with night vision devices. A self-contained flashlight-type package with easy-to-adjust optics is sought. Power will be supplied by off-the-shelf batteries that are easily changed out or recharged.",219,1425,1,No,No,No,,"Address availability, efficiency, and durability of the different laser diode arrays which potentially could meet the specifications stated above. If no diodes exist that can meet the specifications as indicated by current PL research, development of such diodes will be performed. Research and develop high-efficiency power supplies for powering the laser diode array. Design and develop rugged supporting electronics that will control the temperature of the chosen diode array to maximize performance and longevity. Design an optical head that will adjust from 2-20 mrad's with a simple physical manipulation of the hand.","Demonstrate feasibility of system manufacturability by building 20 refined units (10 of each). Units will be field tested by operators in the field and need to be ruggedized and easily operated. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: This system is a multi-use one, capable of providing law enforcement officers a means of illuminating darkened environments without giving away their position, and designating targets for other officers on the scene. The compact system allows use in a variety of environments (darkened buildings, alleys, night scenes). It enhances the ability of the officer to control the engagement with more safety. Operations from helicopters for apprehending or searching for targets on the ground would benefit from the application of a large visible and/or IR laser illuminator/designator. A large commercial potential exists: the darkened environment is one of the most stressful for law enforcement officers. Most squad cars and all helicopter patrols would covet this type of system. After a successful Phase I, field tests will be completed by operators so feedback on the packaging and performance of the systems can be collected. In addition, tactics for a large spot size laser illuminator/designator can be developed during the tests.",,0,"Lyttle, W.B., Repasy, A.J. and Gibson, S.B.

For example, a display constructed using such techniques could have individual pixels which display colors (current displays have 3-sub pixels) using the frame sequential color technique. Furthermore, they would require a lower digital control bandwidth. The second area is in optical correlators. A high speed analog correlator will show superior performance over the currently available bistable devices.

This capability would allow many more users access to data from expensive resources and in some cases would help extend the operationally beneficial life of certain aging airframes. However, before the concepts for sharing such resources are operationally feasible, many technical issues must be resolved. Of particular interest and technical challenge are issues related to the processing and sharing of reference systems information (position, velocity, attitude, and pointing information from, to, and regarding the ownship, other friendlies, enemy operations, and targets). This research is intended to develop a capability to assess the quality of the reference state vectors used in the fusion process. These state vectors are generated by the reference system on each platform that provides or uses the information. The state vector information must be translated to each mission sensor on the information providing platforms. The real-time state vector quality assessment must provide both the quantitative and symbolic measures required to enhance the various levels of information and sensor fusion ranging from intraplatform to interplatform. These measures will range from probability distribution characterization to fuzzy sets, depending upon the fusion algorithms being supported. Technology that would enable consistently representing and reflecting the impact of characteristics of the reference systems data upon platform subsystems dependent upon that data would provide a capability to support theater-wide information fusion with predictable and reliable results. Assessment of technologies developed will be performed using such metrics as targeting error, errors indetecting and discriminating targets and threats, and computational improvements in fusion algorithms. Potential sources of data include E-3As/AWACS, E-8s/JSTARS, national assets, UAVs, reconnaissance platforms, and combat aircraft.

Through the use of analysis and simulation, an assessment will then be performed of the applicability of various technologies to developing a coherent approach to this characterization and the sharing and using of that characterization by the gamut of levels of fusion required in the theater-wide environment.

Typical application scenarios demand robust approaches due to high clutter terrain environments or extensive use of camouflage and concealment or stealth. The Air Force is interested in new approaches to performing automatic target recognition with a variety of sensor modalities, examples of which include (but are not limited to) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Electro-Optic (EO) and Infra-Red sensors, 1D High Range Resolution (HRR) Radar-Frequency (RF) and laser sensors, and 3D laser radar or other 3D scanning sensors. Note that approaches which support fusion of sensor information across any or all of the above sensor modalities and with nonsensor data such as digital maps or object behavior models are highly desired, but not required. Examples of ATR technology components that are of interest include model and Physics-based, evolutionary computing, and behavior-based techniques. To promote understanding for potential respondents, a short explanation of these technology components are given below. Note that these are only examples, and any concept that shows promise for robust, adaptive ATR with remotely sensed data will be considered responsive to this topic solicitation. In addition to techniques for development of ATR algorithms, new and innovative approaches to improve existing ATR evaluation methodologies and tools, including both analytical and experimental approaches are also sought. Model and Physics-based ATR - techniques that make explicit use of target object geometry models and/or the physics of the image or sensed data formation process. This could include explicit models of the 3D world-to-sensed data geometric transformation, the emitted or scattered radiation from the target object(s) and how this energy is sensed and processed to form the sensor output. Such approaches often include matching of predicted features to features extracted from sensed data. Evolutionary Computing - this is characterized by a performance-driven selection process and a population of elements that undergoes reproduction with variation, in a manner similar to natural evolution. The motivation is to endow the computer with a capability to synthesize nonintuitive solutions to problems with minimal or no human interaction (other than in setting up the process). Key elements include a comprehensive representation domain for the problem, an intelligent search strategy and a performance evaluation methodology. Techniques which automatically or semi-automatically generate feature detectors or other algorithm components to create new pattern recognition systems are desired. Behavior-based ATR - Behavior recognition can supply possible hypotheses for ATR that are not apparent from a direct analysis of the sensor information. Inferring the possible intent of a group of vehicles may often be the key to their identification, where purely visual-like processes may face difficulties. As examples, in air-to-air combat tracking the possibly threatening maneuvers of a group of aircraft may be the key to recognizing them as targets, or a vehicle that exhibits no unique sensor signature but moves in a particular fashion could be identified as a mobile missile launcher, but not otherwise. WL/AAC has been supporting the KHORUS environment, which is a public-domain software environment for image and signal processing. KHORUS is the AAC preferred environment for developing ATR algorithms and evaluation techniques, and its use would greatly enhance the potential for Air Force application of any ATR research conducted under this solicitation.

This work is determining the feasibility, merit, and means of obtaining and using shared resources among multiple platforms to enhance tactical aircraft effectiveness. In addition to the CRADA work, research must be performed on the development of on-board sensor managers that will take advantage of the shared resources. This effort will investigate methodologies for managing sensors taking into account cooperative resources from multiple platforms within the same formation. The issues involved include resource control across aircraft, coordination of functions, and alignment challenges. The major function of the sensor manager is to supply useful data to the pilot; therefore, issues such as data formats, data latency, size of data shared, and accuracy of the data will be investigated. A major difficulty will be timing aspects which may utilize the high accuracy clock signals from GPS. Another aspect of a shared sensor manager is the data links necessary. This program will examine if present or proposed data links will provide the cooperative functions necessary, the actual development of a data link is out of the scope of this program. It is envisioned that some of the missions multi-platform sensor management can support are cooperative search, tracking, and identification.

Sensor/Data Fusion) is loosely defined as the process by which noise-corrupted data (potentially from disparate sources) is gathered, combined, reasoned-over, and new resource allocation decisions are made. In dynamic, uncertain, and high-stress warfare environments, information fusion is a formidable task--the dimensionality of the space of states and actions makes a comprehensive solution untenable for most realistic problems. Instead, the system designer typically invokes one of the fundamental tenets of systems engineering which we shall call ""Divide and Conquer"": A single, complex process is separated into subprocesses which are then solved independently. For information fusion systems this means that a single large, interrelated process involving gathering data (sensing), filtering data (kinematic and ID estimation), assessing situations, and deciding upon new information-effecting actions is separated into distinct sub-processes with predefined interfaces. Unfortunately, this approach can lead to suboptimal performance resulting from the requirement to contend with complex interactions between the subprocesses. Further, significant computational and communication burdens can be incurred by ensuring that the subprocess interfaces are robust enough to account for all of the complex interactions. Taken together, these problems work to limit the types of information a working system can accommodate. Presumably, the benefits of a holistic approach would include more robust performance with more efficient use of communication/computation assets. This would enable a wide variety of information, including sensor readings, contextual information, and pilot assessments, to be integrated into a single computational framework. Such an approach could also impact attempts to formulate a general-purpose information fusion processing model which currently does not exist. This effort shall seek to broaden the technology base for intelligent information fusion systems by leveraging theoretical results from the biological and cognitive sciences toward developing a holistic, robust information fusion algorithm/architecture (algotecture). In the past, efforts to develop intelligent systems based upon biologically-inspired concepts have led to significant advances and new paradigms (such as reinforcement learning, various types of neural networks, generic algorithms, etc.).

The desire to use such systems to image unknown objects requires that the imaging function be performed at wavelengths that are eye safe; in other words, the wavelength should be longer than 1.4 micrometers. Such wavelengths are beyond the responsibility of typical silicon detectors. It is desired that the detectors operate at a minimum in the wavelength region from 1.5 micrometers to 2.5 micrometers, though operation out to longer wavelengths (5 micrometers) is desired. The detectors must operate uncooled or with moderate cooling at most (no cryogenics). Additional requirements include the ability to gather the entire image on a single pulse from the laser transceiver; therefore, the receiver must contain multiple pixels. Minimum pixel counts would be 32 x 32, with greater than 64 x 64 desired. Another consideration is that the laser radar transceiver will image objects at long ranges, perhaps in excess of 20 kilometers. Because the return signal from objects at such ranges will be extremely small, it is desired that the detectors have some form of gain which would allow them to operate at or near the shot noise limit. A final consideration is to obtain full three-dimensional imagery the detector must be capable of being coupled to readout circuitry that will provide a range counter per pixel. Such circuitry is being developed by Wright Laboratory, WL/AAJT, and is described in the reference listed below.

Thus the laser source must be rugged and reliable with minimal maintenance. In particular, device performance in terms of beam quality and operating efficiency must be either insensitive to optical alignment or automatically aligned. A device with few or no moving parts is also highly desirable since every part in a laser device adds to its complexity and the possibility that malfunctions will occur. Maintaining high quality optical coatings over long periods of time under adverse operating conditions is also a reliability problem for laser sources; innovations which could make optics repeatedly exhibit greater than 10,000 hours between failure is needed. Finally, while the number of airborne applications for lasers increases, the available volume and power on an aircraft do not. A different laser for each application is not going to be viable. A laser source which is flexible in terms of repetition rate (10 Hz to 10 kHz), output pulse energy (joules to millijoules) and wavelength (1-12 microns) is needed to meet diverse needs in the areas of target designation, obstacle avoidance, laser radar, and infrared countermeasures.

The high intensity of short pulses make them particularly useful in situations where high peak power is required. Thus in nonlinear frequency conversion, efficient interactions are obtainable with the high peak powers that are generated in ultrafast lasers. This topic will develop efficient nonlinear frequency conversion techniques using ultrafast laser pump sources while mitigating temporal dispersion effects.

These advances are due to materials, packaging, interconnect, sealing, chip compaction and process control improvements due in large part to transmit/receive module development and commercial processor chip developments. This program will explore applications of new technologies based on sensor requirements and constraints to meet our far-term vision of multifunction digital RF sensors. Enabling Sciences have advanced from Material, Engineering and Mathematical sciences such as Statistics (Estimation Theory), Numerical Techniques (Adaptive Processing), and Communication Theory (IF Sampling). Thus, the combination of enabling science and technology gives hope/confidence that an all digital multi-function RF sensor suite will be accomplished and that this effort allow us to begin to understand the research required and technology needs associated with this vision. 1. Conformal Multifunction Array: Airborne antenna apertures of the future must be low cost, broad band, low radar cross section (RCS) and multifunction in nature to earn their way onto platforms where space is at a premium. To achieve these requirements, radically new aperture technologies need to be cultivated. This research explores a) pattern control for an aperture that is conformal to a doubly curved surface which has never been done before. Electromagnetic computational codes will be developed to rigorously predict the phenomena associated with scanning a beam on a generally doubly curved aperture, and b) the potential for generating multiple simultaneous beams on a general double curved surface which has never been done before. Electromagnetic computational codes will be developed to predict the phenomena associated with formation of multiple beams on a doubly curved surface. 2. System and Concept of Operation: 1) strategies for developing those technologies required to achieve an all digital multifunction RF system, 2) system and concept of operation studies to determine the benefits of potential off-board cues or bi-static operations, and 3) the benefit of multifunction waveforms to timeline loading and survivability through simulation analysis. These studies and analyses will attempt to balance the cost of ownership (i.e., acquisition, operating, and support costs), installation, and performance constraints. 3. Wideband Digital Antenna Electronics: Current antenna electronics at present assumes conventional Nyquist A/D technology. RF (at the microwave band of interest) is converted to IF and finally to baseband. This research explores the emerging Delta-Sigma A/D technology which presents an opportunity to modify the architecture to incorporate a set of dynamically tunable A/Ds that hop, digitize and filter signals at RF. This sampling technology could allow for the reduction of size, weight and cost of a sensor while increasing sensor performance and flexibility. 4. Advanced Spread Spectrum Filter Technology: Current sensor approach to acquire long pseudo-random sequences uses many parallel correlators to simultaneously search multiple Doppler windows.

C/A Code is 1 MHz Gold Code sequence that repeats every 1 msec. These properties make the C/A-Code easily acquired with relatively simple hardware. However, these same code properties make acquisition using C/A-Code vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. Acquisition of GPS using 10 MHz P(Y)-Code pseudo-random (PN) sequence greatly improves system acquisition jamming and spoofing immunity but makes acquisition of the code much more difficult. The difficulty stems from the fact that the jamming requires a large number of chips be integrated for each correlation. The P(Y)-Code chipping rate requires that a large number of correlations must be performed to search even small time uncertainties. Also large Doppler windows have to be searched for frequency uncertainty due to oscillator and doppler uncertainties. These factors create a two dimensional (time and frequency) area that must be searched to acquire the P(Y)-Code. The problem is further compounded by operational considerations which require this search be accomplished with affordable low power/small hardware, in a short period of time, and in a jammed environment. The current Direct P(Y)-Code acquisition approach uses a large number of parallel correlators and/or precise clocks.

Proposals should build on the significant technology base existing for electronic systems design (VHDL, AHDL), Joint modeling and simulation (M&S) standards, and other commercial/industry modeling standards. Collaborative Virtual Prototyping (CVP) involves the application of advanced distributed modeling and simulation over a geographically disperse area using an integrated simulation environment to support design, performance, and producibility trade-off analyses throughout the entire life cycle of system development. The high-leverage Joint standards and M&S initiatives include the DoD High Level Architecture, Joint Simulation System (JSIMS), the Joint Warfare Simulation (JWARS) and the Joint Modeling and Simulation System (J-MASS). Using CVP, a simulation model, developed in parallel with the hardware or technology development, allows the scientist, engineer, or end user to refine system requirements early in the engineering process. A virtual prototype allows the engineer on the desktop to see the impact of design changes. Trade studies using the model can then be performed throughout development as an essential part of the systems engineering process. The Joint M&S Standards emphasize models based on reusable components. The virtual prototyping tools necessitate research in areas such as simulation engineering based on visual programming and visual assembly with domain specific icons and browsers, automated test, automated verification and validation, model based software requirements development, parallel automated documentation, automatic code generation with multiple language support, embedded configuration control, multimedia help and on-line documentation, domain specific toolkits for component developers to populate libraries, application developer toolkits to define requirements and compose model software from components, expert system assistants and domain specific software structural models.",281,2167,1,No,No,No,,"The desired products of Phase I are 1) identification and development of applicable desktop M&S processes and requirements for avionics, 2) identification of the enabling realtime or non-realtime technologies for avionics M&S based upon employing J-MASS as the underlying modeling system, and 3) conduct of specific experiments to verify critical aspects of the defined concepts, 4) development of a system specification, implementation approach, and demonstration plan.","Design and develop the prototype technology and demonstrate the proposed technology in the appropriate Wright Laboratory System Concept and Simulation Division simulation facility. The contractor shall also detail his plan for his Phase III effort. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: M&S is an enabling technology and a change in the way of doing business that will have major implications for the commercial and defense sector. Desktop M&S will become a mainstream concept in the design and production of commercial systems. The commercial marketplace will increase for generic simulation techniques, simulation infrastructure, and off-the-shelf components for applications in financial industries, manufacturing, industrial process control, biotechnology, health care, communication and information systems. Boeing demonstrated the success of integrated computer assisted design with supporting modeling and simulation in bringing to market the 777 airliner. Similarly, the automotive industry has used CAD and modeling for years. Advances in software and computer technology is making CVP and desktop M&S possible and affordable for the small to medium business. Software development itself is a manpower intensive endeavor. Requirements definition remains a problem area where the user is unable to verbalize what he/she wants in detail. Virtual prototyping of software requirements and modeling of the software is a future growth area in which simulation is used to review completeness of software requirements and functionality.",,0,"These references plus additional references are available at the WL/AASE Technical Information Center, contact William McQuay at (513) 255-4511 for additional information; ""Avionics Wind Tunnel, Laboratory Interface Development,"" NAECON Paper, May 1993.; ""J-MASS and Concurrent Simulation in the Laboratory Environment,"" NAECON Conference Paper, February 1996, Public Release Case Number ASC 96-0138.","These references plus additional references are available at the WL/AASE Technical Information Center, contact William McQuay at (513) 255-4511 for additional information; ""Avionics Wind Tunnel, Laboratory Interface Development,"" NAECON Paper, May 1993.; ""J-MASS and Concurrent Simulation in the Laboratory Environment,"" NAECON Conference Paper, February 1996, Public Release Case Number ASC 96-0138.",3,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/60709/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/60709/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,97.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:38:48,,,,,AF97-136_60709,DOD_SBIR_97_P1_C1_AF97-136,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:22.17638+00

Wind tunnel tests require detailed quantitative measurements of flow variables (velocity, pressure, density, temperature) throughout the flow field to understand the flow phenomena and to validate computational fluid dynamics codes. Since probes inserted into the flow field may disturb the flow, these data must be taken by nonintrusive means. Furthermore, to allow detailed investigation of unsteady flow fields, these methods must allow simultaneous measurements on entire planes or volumes in the flow field. Some planar methods, such as Doppler Global Velocimetry (DGV) are capable of making global velocity measurements in the flow field. Others, such as Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) are capable of making density measurements. All these methods face limitations in unsteady flow fields because of the amount of data which must be acquired at high speeds. These methods also have limited dynamic range. A new method to augment these techniques or extend the dynamic range or accuracy typical of these techniques is desired. Ideally, this method would simultaneously provide information on multiple flow variables throughout the flow field. Furthermore, the dynamic range of an ideal technique would allow measurements of velocities ranging over at least 3 orders of magnitude in subsonic flows. This method must provide nonintrusive measurements and would most likely be optically based. The technique must be usable in wind tunnels with limited optical access. The technique should account for distortions due to nonoptical quality wind tunnel windows (e.g. plexiglass). Any seeding material used must be environmentally nonhazardous. The data acquisition hardware required to provide temporal resolution of unsteady flow fields for such a method may also need to be developed.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: Significant advances in flow-field diagnostics have the potential of making a tremendous impact in the commercial aircraft, automotive and trucking industries.

Trade-off studies used to determine which new technology may give the best return on investment are limited due to the lack of existing cost estimating tools that do not address the impact of new technologies on air vehicle designs. Parametric cost estimating relationships (CERs) relying on historical, as-built data, cannot capture effects of advanced materials and technologies. Weight-based CERs only address existing materials mixes and do not take into account the functional complexity of a system, which in some cases drives the cost. Engineering build-up methods are labor intensive, manufacturer specific, and with a show turnaround. The development of a cost estimating tool that will address new technologies impacts in a more realistic manner is desired. Ideally, this development would take into consideration the favorable characteristics of parametric cost estimating relationships and engineering build-up methods, to provide a cost estimating tool that would yield a more reliable, realistic conceptual level life cycle cost estimate of the impact of new technologies in the development of advanced air vehicles. It is desirable that this tool would be developed to be used by design engineers and technical cost analysts.",262,1764,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I would identify a new cost estimating tool and its feasibility, or major improvements to existing tools.","Phase II would develop and test the tool. This phase would include baseline testing for correlation purposes, as well as integration with existing conceptual/advanced design tools to provide a complete suite of tools that would be available to the design community. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: Air Force, Navy, and industry have expressed interest in developing a cost estimating tool that would properly address advanced technology insertions and their impacts in conceptual and advanced air vehicle design. Affordability will dominate development, procurement, and operation of future weapon systems. Cost prediction is essential to the determination of affordability. The commercial sector would benefit from the development of a cost estimating tool that would provide more realistic estimates of the impact of new and advanced technology insertion in future (post JAST) advanced air vehicle systems.

As a result, in late 1993 a USAF Paint Technology Task Force was chartered to establish a strategy for the Air Force paint removal and coating systems of the future. The Air Force Coating System Strategy applies to almost all operational aircraft and identifies aircraft coating system requirements from now until beyond the year 2003. In addition to environmental compliance, the strategy clearly defines long term coating system performance parameters significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art. An advisory panel of internationally recognized experts in the fields of coating technology and corrosion science and engineering, from industry and academia, was chartered to study the potential of a basic research contribution to ameliorate the aircraft paint issue leading to recommendations for a programmatic course of action. As result of that study, the following four areas of basic research activity were identified as enabling for the Air Force to meet its stated objectives by the year 2003. 1. Investigation of synthesis/structure/property relationships for surface treatments, primers and matte topcoats. 2. Identification of degradation mechanisms of polymers in matte coatings and subsequent development of appropriate models for performance predictions. 3. Synthesis of advanced materials (polymers, additives, pigments, inhibitors) for new coating systems. 4. Development of nondestructive evaluation (NDE) for under-coating inspection and coating health monitoring. The Air Force plans to establish basic research programs in each of the above enabling technology areas with participation by the top researchers in the country. Although there are ongoing activities to address environmental compliance, AF requirements are unique in the areas of 30-year life and removal/reapplication of topcoats. Current national and international research activities in the above areas lack a ""fundamentals"" approach, are somewhat unfocused and do not address requirements unique to the Air Force.

Recently, a new generation of polymer-matrix nanocomposites has been developed based on the molecular-level dispersion of highly anisotropic, inorganic nanoscale rods or plates, such as mica-type layered silicates, in a thermoplastic polymeric resin. These new polymer-matrix nanocomposites exhibit superior mechanical characteristics (e.g. 100% increase in the heat distortion temperature) and chemical resistance (e.g. ~ 10 fold decrease in 02 and H20 permeability) compared to the neat resins. These property improvements raise the use-temperature and extend the potential use-environments of the polymeric material. Additionally, in contrast to conventional filled-polymer systems where inorganic loadings are greater than 30 wt%, these nanocomposites contain less than 10 wt% of the inorganic. Thus, the overall weight of the nanocomposites is less than that of conventional composites and the impact strength of the nanocomposites is less than of conventional composites and the impact strength of the nanocomposites is not drastically decreased with respect to that of the neat resins. These impressive properties are believed to be related to the homogenous nanoscale dispersion of the highly anisotropic nanoscale inorganic phase. In contrast, conventional filled resins and composites utilize inorganic fillers on the micron or larger scale, such as talc, kaolinite, carbon black, glass fiber and carbon fiber. This technology has yet to be explored for potential Air Force applications. These materials may replace current composites and filled polymer materials in substructure applications, such as trusses, in rockets and aircraft resulting in a weight and cost savings. Also, these nanocomposites could replace nonpolymeric materials in some noncritical structural applications such as fuel-line brackets, stirred combustion chambers and cryogenic storage containers, again resulting in weight and cost savings. New economically-viable, preferably nonsolvent based processing techniques are sought which retain or improve the nanoscale dispersion and global alignment of the inorganic phase and result in polymeric-matrix nanocomposites with superior mechanical, thermal and chemical properties.

However many studies suggest significant improvements in the reliability when host aircraft are dehumidified. Most of the data sets collected have been simple summations of maintenance actions for one or more dehumidified, and a like number of very similar, non-dehumidified aircraft. Little or no data has been gathered which identifies the actual causes of degradation and failures dehumidification appears to prevent or reverse. The dehumidification studies have been performed on avionics built using traditional requirements/parts. These suggest dehumidification can apparently effect a 20% reliability improvement (indicating substantial moisture sensitivity), in assemblies using conformally coated hermetic parts. As mentioned, little of no information is available to explain the root causes of moisture sensitivity in older systems or those of more recent design. An additional complication is the trend away from traditional military hermetic parts. These parts are being replaced with technology families often more sensitive to moisture and other environmental stresses. A prime example is integrated circuits (ICs). Military standard ICs were required to be packaged in hermetic metal, glass, or ceramic. Many assemblies now in development include ""commercial grade"" plastic encapsulated integrated circuits. These have a well documented history of moisture sensitivity. Other examples are plastic encapsulated discrete semiconductors, non-hermetic capacitors, various resistors types, connectors, wiring, and printed wiring boards. When more moisture sensitive technologies are used, even more sensitivity assemblies can be expected. Physics-of-failure data is necessary to optimize dehumidification profiles (temperature, relative humidity, duration, etc.) to stop or reverse each mechanism by device type, or material. These then provide the basis for optimized profiles at system through aircraft levels.",275,2029,1,No,No,No,,"Identification of the most inherently moisture sensitive components and assemblies.

This supports cost bendfit analysis required by system owner/operators in making decisions about the use of dehumidification or other alternatives. These capabilities also enable the acquisition community to choose among design alternatives to minimize moisture sensitivity of new assemblies.

Examples of areas of interest include, but are not limited to high temperature windings and potting materials (>400 degrees C, 600 degrees C goal) for switched reluctance machines (SRMs), high temperature bearings for lubeless APU applications, fault tolerant winding configurations for permanent magnet (PM) generators, and high temperature PM materials with high performance. Other areas of interest are self-excitation for switched reluctance generators, hybrid bearings, touchdown (backup) bearings, and windage reduction. Innovative thermal management concepts are also sought in the area of high temperature electronics and actuator cooling. An emerging family of silicon Carbide (SiC), Silicon Nitride (SiN), and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) power electronics will operate at junction temperatures >200 degrees C in the near term and >600 degrees C far term. Even though the efficiencies of these devices will be much greater than conventional silicon devices, the power densities will be 4 to 8 times higher. Therefore, even greater power dissipation levels and waste heat fluxes must be dealt with. Passive thermal management concepts for high performance aircraft have the potential for being reliable and simplistic in design, and are therefore preferred. However, such concepts must deal with the inherent coupling of transient heat generation and transient acceleration-induced forces, and their effects on the cooling performance of the device. For example, as a direct result of aircraft orientation, altitude, and speed, efficient cooling of flight actuation components results in addressing a transient heat generation problem which is coupled to transient accelerations and transient external boundary conditions. When active cooling is proposed, existing aircraft fluids such as JP-8,polyalphaolefin, 7808, or 5606 must be used, unless that cooling system is conceived as a line replaceable unit (LRU) or is modular. Reduction of initial cost, maintenance, and logistics should be a key objective for all efforts. The effects of altitude or the impact of the use of compressor bleed air must be addressed when air cooling is proposed. Areas of interest include but are not limited to, microchannel cooling, immersion cooling, heat exchangers with enhanced heat transfer surfaces, and the use of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) to control and enhance interfacial heat transfer.",430,2907,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a detailed technical definition of the problem, identify a proposed solution, and demonstrate the key technologies enabling the use of that solution.","Concentrate on development of prototype components, subsystem demonstrations, and hardware development.

These two areas address applications for the More Electric Aircraft program, solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), power systems for ground support of UAV systems, air combat training and remote sensor sites. The More Electric Aircraft program demands high-temperature (350 degrees C) and high-power electronics for use in power management and distribution, actuator motor control, on-site ""smart"" sensors, and data bus electronics. WBG semiconductor materials are projected to be excellent semiconductors for high power, high frequency and high temperature applications due to their high critical breakdown field, high saturation drift velocity, and high thermal conductivity. An objective of this solicitation is to seek proposals that offer solutions to critical issues related to WBG semiconductors, including, but not limited to (1) both deposited and natural dielectric insulators, (2) deposition and characterization of ohmic contacts, (3) cleaning techniques for WBG semiconductors, (4) ion implantation, doping, for WBG materials including diamond, and (5) concepts for WBG device topographies. Just as the evolution of silicon power semiconductor devices led to the development of advanced power concepts such as ""smart"" power and ""optically-triggered"" power, the evolution of WBG-based power semiconductor devices is expected to include implementation of these technologies, as well. This solicitation also seeks proposals containing innovative concepts that integrate such advanced technologies with the WBG-based devices. There has been increased emphasis within DoD regarding commitmentto the use of UAVs. PV-powered UAVs offer a number of unique military operational advantages; they exhibit virtually nonexistent thermal signatures, their use of lightweight (nonmetallic) materials make them virtually radar transparent, their reliance on a noncombustible propulsion system enables operation at extremely high altitudes (60,000-100,000 ft), and their use of unlimited solar power together with energy storage enables very long duration missions. Such UAVs will require lightweight, high-power density PV arrays mounted on the aircraft wings to provide daylight power for electric-propulsion and charging of batteries for nocturnal propulsion. Power- and mass-density of photovoltaic (PV) cells play an important role in enabling electrically-powered UAVs for a variety of military and civilian missions. Proposals are sought containing high performance PV cell concepts that approach or exceed performance parameters of 18% conversion efficiency, 0.04 lbs/ft*2, 1300 watts/kg. Small, highly efficient power systems support a number of issues important to Air Force operations: the higher efficiency reduces the problem of fuel resupply in the field, improves mobility, reduces logistics costs for remote sites, and addresses environmental issues associated with operation of inefficient power systems in environmentally sensitive regions. Proposals submitted against this need should offer innovative concepts to transition advanced conversion technologies to use in mobile, and/or unattended power systems. Proposals may address an innovative solution to a subsystem (combustor, power conditioning, conversion system, etc) problem or a complete generator system. Desired features include a system efficiency greater than 10%; i.e. 4-5 times present thermoelectric generator systems; output power of 5 to 200 watts; operating temperature environment +100 degrees F to 135 degrees F; multifuel combustor using JP-4, propane, etc.",518,3784,1,No,No,No,,Demonstrate feasibility of the proposed system or component.

They employ conventional linear control system algorithms which are implemented with discrete time realizations. The most advanced engine control systems now employ model based control techniques which provide more accurate control, optimizing dynamic performance over the engines operating envelope. Model based controls employ a tracking filter to adjust the engine model. Future engine control systems will have higher performance, lower cost, employ damage tolerance techniques, and have significantly reduced maintenance cost.

Most existing laser radar systems rely on one of two schemes for finding the distance to an object; either a pulsed detection scheme which measures the photon-time-of-flight or a coherent detection scheme which measures the radio frequency beat noise of two interfering optical signals. Generally, these systems operate with a single element detector (or a linear array of such elements) combined with a scanning laser beam to assemble an image. Each of these systems has several drawbacks which limit their applications, particularly in areas where cost is a concern. Current direct detection systems tend to have limited range resolution (inches) and are often limited by background noise, while current coherent systems tend to be complex and expensive. The use of a scanner limits the data rate of the system and the environment in which it can be used. The area searched by a system is limited by the required resolution and the data rate of the system. Although these two basic design concepts dominate the laser radar field, several variants of these systems and other system concepts are feasible. The goal of this topic is to develop laser radars based on techniques which promise a substantial performance improvement and/or cost reduction. Approaches which can improve the range or angular resolution are of interest. Systems which rely on previously unexploited optical properties (such as wavelength dependent properties) are also of interest.

Reduction of the optical noise increases the system signal-to-noise ratio, thereby increasing the probability of detection and accurate measurement of a given event. While high-performance compact narrowband filters are available at some specific wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared, there are currently no tunable filters available with equivalent size and performance. Recent advances in tunable laser technology make the development of high-performance tunable filters highly desirable. Currently, there are a few techniques which are used to filter tunable radiation; however, few of these have the size or performance required by our applications. For instance, monochrometers can be used to produce a tunable filter with a fairly narrow optical bandwidth; however, they are large, not particularly rugged, and generally do not have a very high throughput. In this project we are interested in producing a device which can be used as a tunable filter. The desired performance parameters are: tuning range from 1.5 microns to 2.5 microns, full width half maximum (FWHM) bandpass of 1 nm or less, greater than 70% in-band throughput, and greater than 40 dB rejection of out of band signals.

One of the principal challenges to the field use of this technology is the lack of corresponding high-quality receivers. The receiver is needed to convert the returned optical energy to an electrical signal usable by digital circuitry and is generally composed of an optical detector, amplification and discrimination electronics, and an analog-to-digital converter. One challenge to the design of these receivers is the very large dynamic range required; the returned signal falls off as one over R-squared (best case), where R is the range to the object being imaged, and this problem is exacerbated because the reflectance from various objects can range from less than 1% to greater than 99%. A second challenge is the desire to time the arrival of the returned optical energy to greater than 1 ns accuracy, although transmitted pulse lengths are often longer than 10 ns. This requires implementation of pulse discrimination techniques in the receiver. While it is possible to obtain receiver systems which have either high sensitivity, wide-bandwidth, low-noise, or large dynamic ranges; suitable combinations of these desirable characteristics in a single receiver are not currently available. This limits overall performance for an application since systems must often be optimized for a particular region of the desired operating space. Detectors, such as avalanche photodiodes (APDs), are now available which can simultaneously fulfill many of these requirements; however, these detectors are useless without the appropriate electronics to capture and convert the optical signals into electrical signals usable with conventional digital circuitry. It is desirable to have electronics which can capture both the temporal and intensity information from an event with high accuracy over the desired dynamic range. Currently, there are no commercially available electronics packages which can support the desired operating range. The goal for this project is to develop receiver electronics which can accurately capture the intensity of an optical pulse with a dynamic range of at least 5 orders of magnitude and convert this pulse to a digital signal with high accuracy. The dynamic range must start from the minimum detectable signal from the detector. For purposes of initial design, a commercially-available InGaAs APD detector can be assumed. The electronics must be able to detect the pulse arrival with a minimum accuracy of 1 ns for optical pulse lengths from 1 ns to 20 ns in length.

Ladar intensity data is not currently being used in ATI algorithms because its inherent characteristics are not thoroughly understood (e.g., speckle fluctuations, aspect dependency, variations associated with range to target as well as atmospheric and weather conditions). These characteristics make it difficult to compare intensity data to some physically meaningful quantity. If the basic characteristics of intensity signatures are identified and a steadfast method of characterizing them is achieved, it is anticipated that the intensity data will provide an indispensable way of distinguishing dissimilar textures. This, in turn, will allow target signatures to be distinguished from background terrain and clutter thus improving detection, recognition, classification, and identification capabilities for autonomous algorithm performance.

Testing is conducted using rocket propelled sled vehicles guided by steel slippers which ride on continuous steel rails. The rails are standard 171 lb/yrd crane rails, butt welded in 39 foot sections for a length of 10 miles. Extreme straightness of the rail is required to reduce the dynamic loading induced into the sled vehicle traveling along the track, particularly at high speeds approaching Mach 10. Straightness of the rails is maintained through precision survey and rail alignment. In spite of this, small irregularities of the rail do exist. These irregularities cause a _dynamic bounce_ of the sled traveling down the rail at high speeds. At hypersonic speeds, the impact of the sled on the rail can cause a tear-drop shape of material (gouge) to be eroded away from the surface of the rail, sometimes resulting in a mirrored effect, occurring simultaneously (lasting micro seconds) on the inside of the slipper. Slipper wear is affected by a combination of conditions, including slipper materials, slipper bearing pressure, and ram-air pressure (between the slippers and the rail) that produces forces affecting rail contact and causes aerodynamic heating. These effects change as a function of velocity.

This is particularly true in the area of modeling performance in hostile environments as caused by nuclear effects and space. The benefits of using modeling and simulation to predict system performance have become widely understood in the industry and the DoD. System behavior can be evaluated early in the design cycle, well before expenditures and resources are more deeply committed to a design with an unforeseen flaw. Also, ""what if"" scenarios may be readily accomplished, speeding up decisions regarding approach, and hence mitigating design risk. The more detailed the model, the more accurately system behavior will be predicted. Detailed electro-optic device models are very complex mathematical structures which combine concepts ranging from applied physics to advanced numerical analysis.

Sustainment is only working on what needs attention (on-condition-maintenance) as opposed to most remanufacturing (total teardown and rebuild). A great deal of technology exists to aid the production and manufacturing domain. However, little has been developed for the sustainment domain. Normally, the assumption has been that _what works for manufacturing_ will also work for remanufacturing and sustainment. This is verifiable by the current DOD _acquisition_ process which appends operations and support to the end of the development and production and recommends the same systems engineering process and tools for maintenance and repair of weapon systems. In reality, and especially for large complex systems, the nature of maintenance and repair is such that a portion of the work is unpredictable (not identified until programmed work has been initiated), and therefore not planned for through the methods and tools used to manage the work. In cases where the end item is completely disassembled and routed for repair (remanufactured), information systems developed for standard production prove quite useful. However, when the objective includes minimizing the amount of invasive disassembly needed for overhaul, then the information and decisions necessary for efficient management and control of the repair changes dramatically. Production management and scheduling systems (such as Critical Path Method, or _CPM,_ and Project Evaluation and Review Technique, or _PERT,_ which assume knowledge of and independence of activities) often produce impossible _work to lists_ due to the heavily shared resource pools, and activity dependencies found in sustainment. The information concerning the maintenance and repair is continually being acquired during the repair cycle. Especially for large systems, e.g. aircraft and ships, there exists a substantial amount of work which is identified only after the depot has taken possession of the end item and repair work has been initiated. Moreover, the lag between the time when these _unpredictable_ discrepancies are identified when the replacement parts have been ordered and acquired can be extremely long, and therefore costly. The nature of this type of (minimized disassembly) remanufacturing necessitates that the rules, processes, and objects needed to minimize the effect of maintenance and repair on large system availability at a minimum cost of resources must be examined so that the appropriate science and technology can be applied. These characteristics of the maintenance and repair domain will be documented using the enterprise engineering Integration Definition language (IDEF) family of methods. Minimally the research should investigate the nature of: 1. Unknown work effect on labor and bills of repair and materials 2. Flexibility of sequence on repair, especially on large weapon systems 3.

Frequent revisions are discouraged. Even though different tests have different data requirements, designing different telemetry formats to accommodate those requirements efficiently are typically not done. Instead, flexible, inefficient formats are designed and modified slightly to avoid gross inefficiencies. Currently, Flight Test Instrumentation Engineers manually create the telemetry frame format. The format must accommodate the test's required sampling rates for specific measurements on-board the aircraft. It must also accommodate the sampling capabilities of the instrumentation system. For example, the aircraft longitude, latitude, and altitude may only need to be sampled once per second, while more safety-critical parameters like pitch, roll, and airspeed may be required at 10 or 20 samples per second. The instrumentation system may require data settling time or recovery time before another sample from a transducer's data channel can be processed. Instrumentation Engineers use their knowledge of test requirements, transmission bandwidth restrictions, and instrumentation system capabilities to design the data format. The design process involves trade-offs and compromises, requiring the application of logic and reasoning. If an algorithmic or a process-oriented solution for designing telemetry formats could be devised, it could revolutionize the Flight Test Instrumentation business. If a unique format could be produced satisfying the constraints of the instrumentation system, requirements of the testers, and limitations of transmission bandwidth significant cost reduction would result. Not only would requirements and constraints balancing be automated, saving staff-hours, but the significant amount of communication and coordination between airborne and ground systems about telemetry format details could be eliminated.

Cable wrap techniques limit the ability of the tracking system to track continuously without dropping track and ""unwrapping"" the cables. Rotary wave-guide joints are only used for the transmission of radio-frequency signals through the axes of the mount. Most ground-based tracking systems at the AFFTC use mounts with two orthogonal axes, an elevation axis that is constrained to approximately 180 degrees of motion, and an azimuth axis. Some systems use cable wrap connections that limit rotation in azimuth to about 360 degrees, while others use rotary joints and slip-rings that allows them to rotate freely. New technological changes use electro-optical sensors are smaller, lighter, and provide higher performance than their predecessors. There is a tendency to add more sensors to existing mounts resulting in an increased number of data streams at higher rates. High definition color video and infrared sensors are among the new packages being installed on tracking systems that generate high-rate data streams. A reliable method of transmitting the higher data rates is required without impacting the data quality or limiting the tracking capabilities of the system. An optical approach would provide a high bandwidth, low noise transmission path without limiting the rotational capability of range instrumentation systems. Optical rotary connectors must be capable of duplex transmission of multiple high-rate electro-optic sensor data streams and control signals between the rotating and stationary parts of the system.

One of the primary driving cost factors in rehosting TPSs is the ATS Interface Test Adapter (ITA). In the past, weapon system managers have acquired proprietary test systems with unique interfaces to support their TPS requirements, greatly adding to the long term costs of maintaining the TPSs, when rehosting is required. Review of commercial ITA products indicates that standardization is possible, representing a tremendous opportunity to cut these long term supportability costs. The DoD currently uses commercial product standards to meet ITA requirements, which has helped in some degree to reduce TPS rehost cost. The DoD's ITA requirements can be expressed in a commercial standard, eliminating dependence on single sources, increasing competition, and stimulating market growth by allowing multiple vendors to participate in manufacturing products for market. Consensus exists within the DoD and industry to formulate an ITA standard which would drastically cut TPS rehost costs. Initial contacts with industry concerning the development of such a standard has been very positive.

The plastic layers add puncture resistance and allow the material to be heat-sealed. Bags made from this material, in accordance with MIL-B-117, are watervaporproof (WVP) with strong WVP seals, have high strength seams and are used to package items which are easily damaged by low levels of humidity. Because it's highly WVP, items can often be packaged without further preservation (coatings or desiccant).

The technique uses heat generated by the absorption of a high-powered laser beam to coalesce metallic compounds that are introduced at the surface of a base metal. The method forms an alternate alloy with desirable characteristics in a thin surface layer. In the AEDC application, the addition of chromium produces a corrosion resistant surface alloy. AEDC and UTSI recently engaged in an experimental feasibility investigation focused on determining the applicability of the method in the ETF environment. Although, the investigation addressed proof of concept, AEDC requires the development of an efficient and cost effective LISI system, optimized to the ETF plant environment, prior to large-scale application. The ETF plant environment contains approximately two miles of air supply durcting with diameters ranging from 24 inches to 108 inches, as well as valves, elbows, and expansion joints. The interior surfaces contain irregularities produced by welded seams or existing corrosion. A limited number of strategically placed 18 inch diameter ports provide access to the interior of the ductwork. ETF test requirements limit the time available for system installation and utilization. The developed LISI system must be portable, able to be rapidly put in place, and capable of modifying large and irregular surface areas. Typical access times to areas requiring repairs will be less than three days. A system for implementing the LISI technique at AEDC must include the following: (1) a remotely-operated robot capable of traversing the ductwork, (2) a laser beam delivery unit on the robot capable of precisely focusing the laser beam and scanning the beam over predetermined patterns, and (3) an alloying element delivery unit that operates in conjunction with the beam delivery unit. It is desirable to position the laser external to the duct; a method for delivering the laser beam to a remote site inside the duct from an externally positioned laser (e.g., a fiberoptic cable) is needed. The development must provide an increase in the demonstrated application rate of 10 sq ft/hr by at least a factor of two. Higher application rates are desirable. The economic viability issue will center on the application rate. A robotic unit that can be rapidly deployed and removed must be developed to permit quick response to the AEDC operational schedule.",545,3615,1,No,No,No,,A demonstration and evaluation of the proposed technique or process will be performed.,"Phase II should result in a fully functional prototype capability for use by the Air Force. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: The commercial market for this capability is extensive. Chemical refineries, power plants, ocean shipping facilities, bridges, and any steel structures exposed to the environment will benefit from this technology. The useful design life of these critical structures will be greatly increased. The replacement of aged and corrosion damaged structures can be avoided or postponed. The cost of fabricating new corrosion resistant structures will be reduced dramatically.",,0,"Notice: Only government personnel will evaluate proposals.

This is resulting in problems and inefficiencies. Innovative approaches are desired to provide the following added capabilities. Proposals may be submitted addressing any one of these subtopics. The proposal title should identify the particular subtopic. a. ON-THE-FLY, LOSSLESS DATA COMPRESSION The data rates on the WAN links are generally far less than required to support the timely transfer of perishable data. The data subsystem does not have sufficient time to format and file the perishable data for compression processing. This limitation leaves only one alternative for increasing transfer rates other than increased use of satellite resources: On-the-fly data compression within the data network. The challenge for the innovator is to develop an inexpensive, lossless compression system that will not adversely affect either the current (TCP/IP) networking protocols or future (ATM) protocols. b. DATA LINK CONTROL PROTOCOL. Local area networks are being interconnected to form wide area networks using satellite systems. The standard networking protocols in use by the commercial-off-the-shelf computers and networking equipment do not tolerate the bit error rates and delays that are typical of satellite links. This results in the inefficient use of satellite resources. The challenge for the innovator is to develop a data link control protocol that will work with the current (TCP/IP) networking protocols or future (ATM) protocols and allow these protocols to operate efficiently over satellite links. c. SELECTIVE RETRANSMISSION APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL. The defense community's standard transport protocol, transmission control protocol (TCP) does not perform well over satellite links with large delay bandwidth products. Standard commercial protocol stacks generally support both TCP and the user datagram protocol (UDP). An application layer protocol using UDP would require users to install an additional application on their existing computers. This application would use UDP to establish one-way connections between computers transferring information. The application layer protocol would use the UDP connections to transfer the information efficiently regardless of delay or link bit error rate since only corrupted data packets would be retransmitted unlike TCP where all the packets in the sliding window are retransmitted.",374,2602,1,No,No,No,,"In Phase I, the contractor should produce a conceptual design of the relevant system or protocol and identify the system's effects on or interaction with standard networking protocols.

POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: Commercial satellite communications providers are entering the nomadic computing market and also wrestling with the problem of efficient use of satellite resources for network connectivity. A lossless data compression system would be useful in circuit switched networks where bandwidth limitations also exist.

Although elimination of lead in solder is a target, the amount of lead involved in the soldering process is small. Equally important environmental hazards in the solder process are contained in the pre-cleaning and post-cleaning operations. The chemicals used in these operations are major contributors to environmental pollution and hazards to worker's health. DoD specific electronic assemblies, and countless commercial products, currently rely on lead based connection processes ranging from automated surface mount technology to manual bench operations. Nonhazardous automated, high volume soldering processes are under development in many areas.

The need is for a conductive material soldering process which will allow environmentally conscious, rapid, simple, low temperature, wide latitude processing. The successful process/materials must be oxide tolerant, insure complete flux removal (if flux is required) and require no environmentally objectionable solvent cleaning. In addition the conductive material solder alternatives must be cost effective, tractable, capable of manual application, have similar joint strength as current lead solder techniques and not have any negative impacts to performance of hardware.",209,1547,1,No,No,No,,"Will include analysis of the State-of-the-Art materials compatible with the requirements of environmentally conscious manual soldering processes, development of candidate formulations, down select tests to identify the most promising materials, and laboratory simulated manual production application demonstration of selected candidates.","This phase will optimize selected formulations, conduct applicable production/process/application/performance tests to prove feasibility, and provide prototype demonstrations of applicability to manual processing/performance requirements.

Although lead is an objectionable component in these processes, other environmental hazards in the solder process are contained in the pre-cleaning and post-cleaning operations.

Current techniques utilize high temperatures, strong chemicals, and/or ultraviolet radiation to sterilize contaminated items. All these approaches can require significant fractions of an hour to be effective over a limited amount of surface area. In addition, insulated chambers, toxic waste fluid. and eye damage hazard are respectively undesirable side effects of those techniques. In a combat situation, one prefers a self-contained system that is easy to use with no hazardous byproducts. Clearly, techniques that work in seconds rather than minutes or hours are also greatly preferred. It has recently been demonstrated in university laboratories that materials exposed to a one-atmosphere-pressure glow discharge plasma can be sterilized of biological contaminants in under one minute. It seems likely that such a plasma could similarly neutralize some subset of chemical warfare agents as well. Such plasmas are simple to create, can be switched on-and-off, and produce no toxic byproducts. However, questions that remain to be answered include their effectiveness against a full range of chem/bio warfare agents as well as their optimization with respect to power consumption and field-portability. Possible interference with battlefield electronics must also be considered. PHASE I: Design and fabricate a laboratory atmospheric glow discharge plasma decontamination apparatus which could be made field-portable.

Test the effectiveness of the prototype system against a realistic spectrum of biological and chemical warfare agents.

For example, solid lubricants reduce friction and wear in rolling and sliding contacts and to protect against fretting and galling. To increase the thrust-to-weight ratio in gas turbine engines (GTE), higher operating temperatures must be achieved. Currently, some solid lubricants are available which provide effective lubrication from subambient to about 400(C while others can operate effectively only above 500-600(C. To meet the increased temperature requirements in GTE's, lubricants that are effective from subambient to 850(C are required. Several approaches have good potential. Adaptive lubricants which undergo chemical changes as temperature increases to continuously provide low friction have high potential[1]. Oxides can be stable at high temperature in the atmosphere, but typically are brittle and can produce abrasive wear debris. Nanocrystalline oxides can deform plastically and provide lubricious surfaces as compared to traditional oxides [2]. Adaptive lubricants reactions are typically irreversible. Thermal cycling may be limited by complete reaction of adaptive components to high temperature lubricant which would be unable to perform at low temperatures. Multilayering and composite structures have been proposed as solutions to this problem. Nanocrystalline oxide coatings can undergo crystal nucleation and growth at elevated temperature. Therefore, the development of lubricious nanocrystalline oxides must consider crystal growth phenomena. Both approaches hold promise, but the issues discussed must be addressed for successful development of a broad temperature range lubricant. PHASE I: In designing the project, Phase 1 would concentrate on the type of solid lubricant, remembering the issues raised above and the lubricants chemistry. PHASE II: The logical follow-on would be to concentrate on development, characterization and test of the solid lubricant, with a deliverable of the lubricant as the goal.

These problems include but are not limited to corrosion fatigue, widespread fatigue damage (WFD), fretting fatigue, fretting corrosion, joint debonding, composite delamination, and composite impact damage.

HUMAN SYSTEMS INTERFACE: It is of utmost importance to initiate a project that develops and demonstrates decision aids, information controls, and display formats that foster data fusion; and situation awareness, assessment, and response for operators of multiple Uninhabited Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV). The expectation is that the resulting operator-vehicle interface will reduce workload and enable mission effectiveness for a single operator controlling up to four UCAVs performing a lethal Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) mission. The operator is not expected to perform rudder and stick flying but to give tactical and strategic direction as a human in the loop. The objectives of this program are to improve UCAV operator productivity and to enhance mission effectiveness. The main goal is to exploit decision aid and 3D display technology to support a single operator of multiple UCAVs performing a SEAD mission in conjunction with other flights of uninhabited and inhabited aircraft. PHASE I: A multi-part analysis needs to be performed and reported. (1) Concept of operations to explore the application UCAVs in a SEAD mission. (2) Operator-vehicle interface requirements analysis, to include an analysis of current and future data sources that could be used as inputs. Applicable technologies such as decision-aiding, communications, information controls, and display formats should be a part of the analysis, as well as the skills and capabilities required of the operator. (3) Design and illustrate a capability based on the concept of operations and the requirements analysis. The design should integrate the data sources and applicable technologies into an operator station that would permit a single operator to control four UCAVs performing a SEAD mission. (4) Produce a report that, via illustration and discussion, lays the foundation for the development and application of specific technologies. PHASE II: Select a meaningful decision aid and display format target. Produce a design definition sufficient to generate software code. The design should include an interface control document. Implement a prototype capability based on the design reported in Phase I and integrate the prototype with a pre-existing operator evaluation system. Demonstrate that the operator evaluation system, coupled with the new capability, delivers statistically significant improvements in operator performance. TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT: There is a need to develop a standardized technology assessment capability for government, industry, and academia to use for design analysis of new and upgraded aircraft. Current methodologies do not address merging technologies and their synergistic contributions to the goals and payoffs of a new aircraft design or upgrades to existing aircraft. An analysis program that is user friendly and features commonality, and reasonable size is required. These needs can be met because advances in computing size, speed, and connectivity make powerful tools available and military-industrial partners recognize that cooperation and leveraging are the only way to overcome the challenges of limited resources. The program should provide a common language, take maximum advantage of currently developed software, and state-of-the-art computer hardware, improve the interface to more sophisticated analysis such as mission effectiveness, maintainability and reliability and survivability, to clearly quantify the benefits of inserted technologies. PHASE I: Define the total program including cost, assessment methodology, architecture, and developmental requirements. PHASE II: Development and validation of analysis program. AIR VEHICLES: Substantial gains in military air vehicle performance are realized through accurate aerodynamic simulation. Exploratory wind tunnel research, often yielding only integrated forces and moments, is inadequate to thoroughly understand and optimize aerodynamic design. This is particularly true of highly maneuverable air vehicles which possess significantly expanded flight envelopes. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) techniques can provide low cost, non-intrusive, full-field pressure measurements, very early in the design cycle, to extensively enhance the understanding of the aerodynamics underlying the force and moment data. However, this technique is not currently applicable at low subsonic speeds where much of the flight envelop of these highly maneuverable air vehicles exists. PHASE I: Will investigate the underlying photochemical, material science, and image analysis issues related to full-field simultaneous PSP measurements in very low speed flows. This is expected to include research on, but not necessarily limited to, the following: multi-lumiphore coatings that allow simultaneous pressure, temperature and reference images; eliminating the need for temperature corrections and complicated image registration schemes; paint chemistry to quantify the effect of the paint binder matrix on system dynamic characteristics and research on lumiphore coatings to decouple pressure, temperature and illumination effects. The Phase I will also examine the specific issues related to implementing such a system both in the VWT for captive spin testing and in the SARL. PHASE II: Will engineer the required coatings, design and develop the measurement system (illumination sources, imagers, and data acquisition system), and develop the image analysis techniques for a PSP system for making high quality measurements in the SARL, VWT, or other facility, as suitable. FIRE SUPPRESSION: The search for an alternative to halon as fire suppressants as a result of the Montreal Protocol ban on ozone depleting substances has yielded few optimum replacements for current deployed systems. Newly-found chemically acting agents still pose unresolved toxicity questions. An innovative approach to suppression of fires is to affect chemical kinetics of critical combustion reactions by exciting critical radicals by exposure to selective photochemical excitation and other innovative approaches such as the use of electric or magnetic fields. The excitation and de-excitation of critical free radicals by means of the use of directed energy can interfere with critical chemical kinetic reactions and cause changes in the speed of flame propagation and produce the eventual extinction of a fire. PHASE I: Should encompass a preliminary experimental study to address the relative effectiveness of using particular (OH, H, CHO, and CH2O to begin with) wavelength radiation to suppress stoichiometric flames. A literature search on radiation effects on flame speed propagation will also be required. An estimate on power requirements in a per unit flame irradiance basis will also be required and used as a basis for a Phase II program. Proposed cost of the Phase I effort: $100,000. The Air Force will make available use of equipment to assist in experimental studies. PHASE II: Should consist of thorough systems design of a radiation-based fire suppression system which will encompass power and control electronics, the design of a ergonomically suitable delivery system, and construction of a small scale prototype. theoretical analysis of suppression capability and yields will also be required. An economic analysis of large scale development will be required for commercial development. Proposed cost of the Phase II effort: $700,000. MODELING AND SIMULATION: It is necessary to identify a design environment and develop a design process which establishes and automates a bi-directional flow of design information between conceptual data and detailed data. Military flight systems development traditionally follows a regimented path starting with conceptual design, leading to preliminary design, followed up by detailed design, manufacturing and production. Many of the decisions about the systems are fixed at the conceptual level, when the least information is available. The far-reaching goal of this topic is to provide the conceptual designer with high fidelity computer generated design data and ultimately give the United States Air Force the ability to make meaningful design tradeoffs between cost and performance. New design architectures are emerging which have the potential to automate the connections between mission planning and Manufacturing applications. These new design architectures or environments can be programmed to facilitate a comprehensive aerospace design process from design layout to manufacturing. In addition, they have the potential to automate design feed forward and feed back in a recursive design process. The architecture should not pre-suppose the design process by assuming that geometry, CSM, CFD, etc., drives the airplane design. The architecture should use a high-level modeling language which works with inter-related objects. The architecture must also be able to save and archive design and engineering data for large complex systems. Ideally, the architecture would be portable to a wide variety of computer platforms including DEC, SGI, HP and IBM Unix workstations and a networked heterogeneous system of computers. PHASE I: Will focus on a demonstration of the feasibility of design feed forward and design feedback between conceptual level data and preliminary design data. The first step will identify a commercially available design architecture capable of automating bi-directional connections between design data and manufacturing data for flight systems. The second step is to identify a simplified (idealized) design process involving airframe components at the conceptual level and linear aerodynamic and structural analysis at the preliminary level. A limited suite of modules for geometry modeling, engineering analysis and design optimization will be selected and modification requirements identified. The feasibility of enabling a complete concurrent design process will be demonstrated after developing a simple feed forward and feed back process between design layout and preliminary analysis of an airplane wing. PHASE II: Will extend the activity of Phase I to include a demonstration feed forward and design feedback between conceptual level data and detailed design data including manufacturing. This extended demonstration will focus on the manufacturing of one or two component such as the wing spar or the wing skin. POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL MARKET: Commercial applications in the above areas exist in the aerospace and other industries for fire fighting, air traffic control, search and rescue, weather monitoring and health care.

These structures provide critical performance enhancements which enable the DoD to field superior weapons systems. Although organic matrix composites are used in a wide spectrum of vehicle structures, the high cost of these structures may severely limit the implementation of this critical technology to its fullest potential. Therefore, new technologies which allow for the affordable implementation of composite structures must be pursued. Tooling costs have been identified as a high cost area especially in the prototype environment and as production rates continue to drop. Composite cure tools must produce dimensionally accurate parts, (match the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the composite part), be affordable to demonstrate the tooling approach in a prototype environment, and be durable enough to meet the requirements of production use. INVAR tools have been shown to meet thermal and durability requirements and are being used extensively on ongoing aircraft production programs. However, INVAR tooling is very expensive and requires significant fabrication lead times. New technologies and methodologies are needed to develop composite processing tools that are low cost, highly durable, have compatible thermal performance characteristics, and short fabrication lead times. The new tooling technology and methodology should address the cost of fabricating both the tool face and substructure. It must provide all the capabilities of internal tooling points, scribe lines, and vacuum ports as available on current INVAR cure tools. PHASE I: Develop and evaluate tooling system concepts and designs that provide high performance composite cure tools. Phase I should provide a description of the tooling approach, preliminary designs of the tooling system, thermal analysis of predicted thermal performance, and cost analysis of anticipated tooling fabrication costs. PHASE II: Develop and demonstrate the new composite processing tool system on a significantly complex tool. Verify the Phase I thermal and cost analysis predictions and demonstrate the tooling performance.

A method to control these failures is to incorporate passive damping into the design of turbine engine rotating components. Due to the extreme temperatures and high centrifugal loads, application of damping treatments to turbine blades is extremely limited. A potential solution to this problem is the application of particle damping, which can be considered a variant of the class of impact dampers. For the blade configuration, minute quantities of either metallic or non-metallic particle s are encased within a small cavity and energy is dissipated by the interaction of these particles within the walls of the cavity through friction and/or momentum exchange. It has been shown empirically that this configuration can develop significant damping; however, research is necessary to characterize the phenomena in a rotating field (particles under compaction) and research is also needed in the design and optimization of particle damping to improve the ability to predict damping effectiveness. PHASE I: Specific experiments should be conducted to verify the critical aspects of the defined concept and a design system established to predict the results thereof. PHASE II: Fabricate a prototype demonstration of the damping concept of Phase I and spin test the prototype to demonstrate the predicted damping effectiveness and durability.

Those commonly used for fuels are hydrazine, monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) or a blend of these fuels. The oxidizer of choice is nitrogen tetroxide (N204 or NT0). These chemicals are highly energetic and consequently are very hazardous. The process of storage and transfer requires that storage vessels and transfer lines be pressurized and purged with inert gas, usually nitrogen. It is necessary that this gas be decontaminated to a level which will not cause violation of federal, state and local air quality restrictions. In the past, this has been accomplished using either burners or scrubbers. While burners will generally reduce the toxic levels adequately, they suffer from emission levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other typical hydrocarbon combustion products. The current trend has been toward utilizing scrubbers which remove the contaminants by either dissolving them or reacting them in a ""liquor."" In most cases, this liquor must then be disposed of as a hazardous waste. This is not in consonance with the national stress on pollution prevention - changing processes such that hazardous wastes are not created, rather than deal with treating them at a later stage. Current hydrazine scrubber design provides excellent removal by simply scrubbing with water - even in view of the new 10 ppb hydrazine limit. However, the hydrazine-water solution is again a hazardous material which must be disposed of properly. The objective of this topic is the development of a variation on the fuel scrubber technology which will combine the proven water scrubber with a proven method for reacting the dissolved hydrazines to a safe product.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in the process of establishing new standards for particulate matter, and the proposed standards will likely place greater restrictions on particulates with diameters less than 2.5 micrometers (currently 10 micrometers as described in the Code of Federal Regulations 40:50), creating a requirement to monitor particulate emissions of this nature. A number of Department of Defense (DOD) operations produce significant amounts of particulate matter emissions which are largely uncharacterized, including aircraft operations, jet engine testing and aircraft painting/depainting operations, which will suffer operational restrictions when the new standards are promulgated. The current measurement techniques involve field sampling followed by laboratory analysis, which are time consuming, labor intensive and costly.

Air used to ventilate these spaces during performance of such operations is tainted with vapors that require decontamination before the air can be released or reused. Conventional oxidation methods occur at elevated temperatures, which requires that energy be supplied to raise the exhaust stream to the ignition temperature of the respective oxidation process. At the concentrations of contaminants normally encountered in exhausts from workspaces, the cost to apply high- temperature oxidation methods is often unacceptably high. Both energy and money would be saved by an oxidation process that occurred at the temperature of the process exhaust, and, if heating, cooling, or humidity control is needed for the process, further economy could be realized either by direct reuse of the decontaminated air stream in the process by recovering heat from the treated exhaust by thermal exchange with incoming fresh air. This project is to develop one or more catalytic materials or composites that can demonstrate complete oxidation of one or more representative hydrocarbons or oxygenated hydrocarbons in room air for an indefinite period of time at a temperature below 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and to incorporate the[se] catalyst[s] into a practical decontamination technology for large-volume ventilation exhausts contaminated by fuels and solvents at high dilution.",230,1569,1,No,No,No,,"Prepare candidate catalyst formulations and evaluate over several hours the ability of each to oxidize one or more hydrocarbons or oxygenated hydrocarbons at low [~10 ppm] concentration in room air at 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

To predict the natural attenuation of the chlorinated compounds or enhance their anaerobic degradation via the addition of a carbon source requires understanding of the capabilities of the native consortia. The presence of bacteria able to carry out sustained dehalorespiration is essential to the success of natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes. Such bacteria are either not present or not active in some subsurface systems. A strategy or technique for detection of the responsible organisms and accurate prediction of their activity in situ is required before natural attenuation can be predicted reliably.

This test method has the potential to be patented and should be marketed to site clean-up companies and contaminated site-responsible parties to assist with their remediation feasibility studies. A validated test method as described above will be invaluable to those making decisions regarding site cleanup.

It will also identify individuals qualified for work activities for which no current occupation exists. These virtual occupations are created and manned to meet unique mission and contingency requirements. In addition, the technology can be applied to situations where small production run weapon systems or subsystems are being acquired and fielded. These systems require operator and maintenance support not addressed in the current occupational structure. For example, an engineer who has designed a system can develop detailed descriptions of the activities required to operate or to maintain the system. These detailed descriptions can be provided to the web assistant so that it can identify current jobs on fielded systems that are similar in work activities. New occupations could then be structured around these activities without an existing occupational structure.

Initial and refresher training of active duty, guard, and reserve personnel pose major problems and challenges to the services. Internet/distance learning environments have become a possibility and are being considered as a partial solution, by cutting the amount of travel that is required to support training. Training of guard and reserve personnel is essential as these groups are growing as the active military force shrinks. Major opportunities and challenges exist for training all of these groups using internet/distance learning vs classroom training or high fidelity simulators. Training in an academic environment between multiple sites in distributed C3 teams or linking high-fidelity simulators poses considerable difficulty. C3 teams have little chance to train together before operationally performing during combat contingencies. The purpose of the effort is to create a multi-user simulation environment (MUSE) to train team performance in command, control, and communication. This type of environment is to be supported through both synchronous and asynchronous communications, and can be used by military personnel to create C3 teams in a range of environments including ground, air, and space. The gaming environment allows trainers to simulate dynamic combat operations in any part of the world and train C3 personnel. The environment would involve command and control operations for air-to-air combat, air-to- ground combat and ground-to-air combat operations. The C3 teams need to be able to plan missions in short order with limited or uncertain intelligence on enemy strengths (i.e., air power, ordinance, air defense artillery, etc.), coordinate their own teams of aircraft, and direct both strategic and tactical flight operations under dynamic conditions. Communications, classifications, recognition, collaboration, team performance, and human performance are the training areas that can be well integrated into a MUSE and delivered over the internet.",309,2116,1,No,No,No,,"The end product of Phase I is an intelligent instructional gaming software product, proof-of-concept, MUSE delivered over the internet with evaluation data.

In addition, research on team performance has underscored the difficulty and importance of gathering detailed objective information about the performance of individuals within a workgroup or team context for use in diagnosing errors in performance, identifying additional training requirements, and ultimately evaluating the successful or unsuccessful performance of the group or team. Finally, recent efforts to develop high fidelity performance assessment methods for aircrew members have demonstrated the importance of situationally-based criterion measures for performance and readiness assessments. An inexpensive, valid and reliable capability to systematically assess performance in near-real-time is required. Develop distributed, collaborative methods and criteria to systematically assess the performance and readiness of individuals, and individuals as participants in work groups and teams. Research to develop distributed performance assessment methods and criteria for use in evaluating the impact of a variety of selection, training, and design interventions on individual, workgroup and team performance and effectiveness will be conducted. The resulting technology and criterion measures may employ text- , digital video-, animation-, and/or simulation-based situations for performance assessment. For example, members of an aircrew could participate in a performance assessment of their Aerospace Physiology knowledge and performance by responding to a series of situations presented to them in text, animation, simulation, or video format via the Internet. Aircrew members will respond to a specific situation in different ways depending on their position in the aircraft. In previous, non-collaborative assessments, each member's response could not be evaluated within the context of the aggregate performance of the aircrew. Further, in most cases the actual criteria used to evaluate the performance was based on subjective ratings of observers and on reviews of after-action reports. Using the developed technology, all members of the aircrew can respond as individuals and can observe the responses of all other members. Some members may actually respond differently based on the given responses of other members. Also, the criterion performance measures are situationally-based assessments from which actual test scores would be obtained. This same performance assessment approach can also be used by dispersed members of a workgroup who must share information about a situation and arrive at a group response or decision. A distributed, collaborative approach for performance assessment not only provides critical information about how all members would perform in the given situation, but the data on their responses can be used to identify innovative solutions, misconceptions about the appropriate solution, and incorrect information that could be addressed in future collaboration or in follow-on education and training programs. Similarly, work groups and teams can be identified, assembled, and assessed more readily if relevant, objective performance measures are developed and used.",474,3410,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I activities will result in a proof-of-concept technology for conducting performance assessments in a distributed, collaborative environment. Also, exemplary criterion measures and data collection methods will be developed for four domains. Two of the domains will be related to military workgroup and team performance and two will be related to non-military domains such as regional sales teams or product development teams. Phase I will also result in a final report.","Develop, apply, test, refine, and validate the distributed, collaborative, performance assessment technology and criterion measures and will develop additional criterion measures to assess workgroup and team performance and readiness. Proposals should assume that the technology will run in a Windows95TM, Pentium-based environment, but platform independent development is strongly encouraged. Phase II will also produce a final technical report.","The results from this effort are of considerable interest to the private sector as a means of gathering team productivity and performance assessments from dispersed work groups for use in identifying areas of high performance, areas of potential problems, and additional education, training, or management requirements. No assessment capability such as the one described herein exists. The benefits from such a capability to Government and private sector agencies could help organizations save considerable time and expenditures by targeting measurement to address specific areas of performance and productivity.",1,"Call author at (210) 536-1981 for copies.; Technical Report, AL/HR-TR-1997-0026.

The importance of training and evaluating teamwork skills has been identified as critical to enhancing performance and reducing accidents in both military and civilian aircrews. As a result, there is a growing acceptance of the need to base aircrew performance evaluations on aspects of crew coordination behaviors such as effective communications, as well as on aspects of technical proficiency, such as maintaining glideslope for landing. In contrast to technical aspects of performance which can be objectively measured and recorded by on-board instrumentation, crew coordination behaviors can only be rated by instructors in the aircraft or simulator. Current methods for capturing instructor ratings of aircrew coordination performance require either that the instructor divert attention from the act of observing on-going behaviors in order to make the ratings on a paper-and-pencil form or that the instructor make the ratings after completion of a flight or simulation based on recollection of what previously took place. Either method degrades the accuracy, objectivity, and standardization of the performance rating process. An alternative approach to current methods of rating crew coordination behaviors and skills is to take advantage of computer technology to develop a handheld input-output device that is completely portable and convenient to use both in a simulator and on actual flightdecks. It is envisioned that the tool will record both structured, i.e., keystrokes on a numeric keypad, and unstructured, i.e., speech, instructor observations through an interface that facilitates the task of making performance ratings while minimizing demands on the instructor's attention. It is also envisioned that the tool will function both as a passive recording device and also as an intelligent associate that uses artificial intelligence technology to support the performance rating task. For example, the associate might recognize certain patterns of low performance ratings and prompt the instructor to add verbal notations expanding on the reason for the pattern of ratings.",334,2272,1,No,No,No,,Phase I will result in the a prototype hardware interface and software for the Instructor's Associate that passively records instructor inputs such as keystrokes and verbal comments.

The following performance criteria should be addressed in the eye tracker design: (1) it must perform in operational environments under a variety of indoor/outdoor, user position/movement, illumination, temperature and humidity conditions, (2) it must operate with users who wear glasses and contact lenses, (3) it is expected that horizontal and vertical eye position measurement accuracies of 1-2 degrees of visual angle will be required, (4) to maximize acceptance, the latency from user eye fixation to fixation determination (including software algorithms) should be no greater than 100 milliseconds, (5) it must add no more than 2 ounces of weight to the HMD and be readily incorporated in, or attached to, current HMD configurations, (6) calibration must take no more than a few seconds when the user initially dons the HMD and it must be self- administered, (7) because of possible HMD movement or slippage, an automatic adjustment routine is highly desirable, and (8) all components must be worn on the user's body and all software must operate on the wearable computer itself.",292,1891,1,No,No,No,,"A fully functional conceptual prototype, integrated into at least one commercially-available wearable computer HMD, is highly desirable as the Phase I product.","The end product for Phase II shall be an advanced development prototype, packaged for field testing, that addresses all deficiencies identified in Phase I.","Given the anticipated demand for wearable computers to support maintenance, repair, delivery, law enforcement, military, medical, and other applications, there will be ample opportunities for commercialization of the Phase II product.",1,"Sons.; Medical Devices and Instrumentation, New York: John Wiley &; measurement techniques.

In spite of the application of advanced concepts of information protection and security, it is generally agreed that perfect protection of these systems is either technically impossible or unaffordable, or both.

Additionally, it is of interest to assess how new and creative concepts of employment of sensor fusion processes can contribute to the realization of effective counter-information and counter-deception techniques, and the general notion of employing the sensor fusion process as a weapon.

One particular area of interest is ceramic membranes that are capable of conducting oxygen ions when supplied electrical power. Currently, many types of ceramics exist that act as ion conductors. This oxygen generating technology is extremely similar to current fuel cell technology. In oxygen generation, oxygen ions are conducted across the ceramic material from the ambient air side to the pure oxygen side of the membrane by heating the membrane. Many specific technical challenges are inherent to ceramic oxygen generators. Membrane seals, thermal expansion differences, module optimization, and electrode/membrane conduction are some of the areas that require extensive research and development. Membrane seals are a challenge due to the high temperatures present in ceramic conduction. Also, differences in thermal expansion rates between the ceramics and possible manifolds and seals provide a technological challenge to be explored. Optimization in ceramic module configuration will allow for larger surface areas to maximize exposure to ambient air, while maintaining the integrity of the module. Because of the fragile nature of the material, a vibration environment may pose problems if not specifically designed and engineered into the module configuration. Electrode/membrane conduction and connection have also proven to be technological hurdles in this system. The Air Force believes technologies exist to conquer these hurdles, however, integration of possible solutions has not been attained. By employing the ceramic technology, system size, weight, reliability, and performance will be improved over current Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) systems. Ceramic oxygen generation technology will also provide a breathing air purification if that air is challenged with contaminants such as chemical or biological agents, carbon dioxide, or carbon monoxide. Another advantage of ceramic oxygen generation over PSA technology is the elimination of a compressor inlet air source to operate the system. If advances in this technology could be made, tremendous dual- use applications will be available, such as oxygen generators for hospitals, welding, space and military applications. Although hospitals may not be interested in system weight/size, portable welding platforms and space applications will benefit from drastic technology improvements.",348,2437,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstration of ceramic oxygen generation technology providing 99.9% oxygen using only electrical power.

Optimal levels of operator state must be maintained in order to maximize system performance. Operator states, such as mental overload, fatigue, and inattention, degrade overall system performance. Psychophysiological measures, such as brain waves, cardiac activity, eye blinks and movements, respiration, and skin conductance, provide information about an operator's state. Multiple brain wave channels may be required. Several approaches are available to use these physiological features to determine operator state on-line, including neural networks, discriminant analysis, and Bayes classifiers. Reliable procedures for determining operator functional state in the workplace need to be developed and tested. A small, wearable, self-contained device is needed that will monitor operator state using physiological signals, record these signals for later review, and determine operator state based upon these signals in the context of the current work environment. Besides collecting and recording the physiological signals, the device will correct artifacts so that uncontaminated data can be used to determine operator state. Nonfunctional or degraded channels must be identified and marked. In addition, data from those channels would not be used until they are again operational. In order to provide the most flexible device, the classifier section should be modular so that different classifiers can be used when appropriate. This is also true for the signal processing portion of the system. Different signal processing modules should be available. For example, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), wavelets, and filtering algorithms will be needed, as will the capability to add new techniques as they are developed. The capability to add more channels of data collection and reduction in the future should be considered. This flexibility will add to the potential use by other agencies, industry, and academia. Individual operator characteristics will have to be considered when determining operator state. Initial training of the classifiers for each operator may be necessary because of these individual response differences. In order to have practical value, an operator state estimator must incorporate relevant system/environmental variables. In order to do this, the device must communicate with the operated system and be able to incorporate this information into its calculations. In an aviation context, segments of flight are associated with known changes in physiology. For example, take-off and landing are associated with increased heart rates and brain wave changes. Inappropriate physiological responses in these contexts are signals that the operator may not have an accurate awareness of the situation and corrective action must be taken. Continuous or graded levels of operator functional state estimates would be more useful than binary, yes-no types of output.",430,2962,1,No,No,No,,"The product will be a design of a system, final report and working model, if possible.","Produce a working model system, including hardware and software necessary to collect and record physiological data. This system should also implement the operator functional state classifier and interface with adaptive systems.","Numerous applications exist for an accurate and reliable operator functional state monitor. They include monitoring drivers of automobiles, trucks and trains. Commercial aviation crew and nuclear power plant operators are further examples.

Research the potential of enhancing aviatorperformance in the cockpit and develop an appropriatePsychological Skills Training program.,"The utilization of Psychological Skills Training programs have been found to significantly enhance performance of elite athletes during both practice and competitive situations. Psychological skills training programs have been fully incorporated into the United States', Japan's, Australia's, Germany's and many other Olympic Training Centers with great success. Military aviators are considered to be very similar to athletes in regard to their specialized physical abilities and cognitive skills. It has been shown that athletes can improve their overall performance by improving their mental approach to performance. Such areas include, but are not limited to, dealing with the stressors of competition, maintaining concentration and focus, utilizing imagery to improve the precision of their performance, setting realistic and action focused goals, etc. The requested research on developing a Psychological Skills Training Program will incorporate both an assessment and training approach to enhancing performance.",140,1018,1,No,No,No,,"During the initial phase, the research focus will be to transition existing Psychological Skills Training programs in the field of competitive athletics to the field of aviation. Identification of the specific psychological skill areas significant to aviation will be necessary. Once these areas are identified, a computer-based assessment device will be developed to measure an aviator's present level of individual skill utilization. The second component of this research endeavor will be to develop interactive computer-based independent training modules for each of the identified psychological skill areas. The focus of these designs will be to enhance the aviator's understanding of the skill, how it can be utilized and provide examples and simulated opportunities to practice each skill. The final product will be the entire Psychological Skills Training Program for aviators to include both the assessment device and the training modules fully documented in a technical report.","Normative data will be collected on the Psychological Skills assessment device to establish norms by which aviators will be compared. The assessment device and training programs will be field tested to determine the overall effectiveness as compared to existing criterion measures that are collected during either simulation training, undergraduate pilot training or other opportunities such as competitive events (Red Flag, Rodeo, etc.).","The Psychological Skills Training Program can be applied to other military situations that involve key decision making, technical training, and high-threat situations.

In certain areas, intelligent interfaces may even adapt based on some determination of cognitive states. In the case of more advanced associate systems, mental models of the user are typically only based on |derived knowledge| from the user. However, the role of affection and beliefs are often not considered in the design of an intelligent interface/associate system. Yet, agent-environment interactivity in real world situations is increasingly dependent upon social considerations, conflict resolution, intuitive hunches, intrinsic values, application of beliefs, and emotional states. Perhaps this is most salient when rationale, normal procedures emerge into crisis settings that create highly volatile, stressful situations that create conflicts/disputes and require immediate attention. Such settings may also present belief as more important than knowledge and/or rules for action. Therein, there is a requirement to develop intelligent interfaces that adapt as a function of sensing/inferring an a) affective state and b) beliefs about an emerging crisis situation.",170,1223,1,No,No,No,,"A review and descriptive framework that considers the role of affective computing and belief systems in agent- environment interactivity will be completed.

These systems, mostly based on pulsed laser sources, have inherent shortcomings associated with a pulsed source. For these systems, the pulse duration typically in the order of nanoseconds, and the low repetition rate often less than 100 pulses per second dictate a low duty cycle. The latter generally entails low detection efficiency and high optical peak power causing an ocular hazard. Almost all pulsed lasers of useful energies require a large and heavy power supply unit which makes the system unsuitable for sensor platforms of moderate sizes such as space orbiting platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and aircraft. Furthermore, these systems which often require intensive operator's oversight are too unpredictable to perform autonomously. To overcome the above shortcomings, continuous-wave (CW) devices such as laser diodes, with power and performance improving at a fast pace, are envisioned to be used in a new class of compact lidar systems of high duty cycle and low power consumption. Instead of depending on the short duration of the laser pulse to determine accurately time of flight and therefore target range, new approaches are sought to obtain range and Doppler information with a CW source. Such approaches include, but are not restricted to, amplitude and frequency modulation. The approaches selected by the performer are, however, required to be compatible with lidar techniques used to measure trace gases such as differential absorption and laser-induced fluorescence. Spectral flexibility is desired to selectively probe the absorption line and monitor multiple gases. Provisions are sought to extract Doppler signal and measure the line-of-sight velocity of the detected gases. The gases of interest to the on-going program are rocket exhaust plume effluents such as nitrogen dioxide, hydrochloric acid and chlorine. The criteria to evaluate the progress is based on the system's ability to detect those gases at concentrations 10 times less than typically found in ground clouds, spatial resolution better than 30 ft and temporal resolution better than 10 seconds. The listed application and criteria represent relevant candidates and valid benchmarks for the demonstration of this capability.",356,2365,1,No,No,No,,"The proof-of-principles demonstration of CW lidar operation can be performed with a prototype on Rayleigh and Mie scatterers, atmospheric gas and aerosols, with range resolution and at a distance of up to 2 km.","Develop an experimental lidar system with differential absorption or fluorescence capabilities to measure plume trace gases to a nominal distance of 5 km. The system would demonstrate the potential to satisfy the requirements of autonomous operation, compactness and low power consumption.","NASA and commercial launch agencies would like to monitor the gas environment near a launch site with inexpensive and autonomous remote sensors to document the environmental impact. Chemical companies and EPA could use these sensors to monitor the targeted gaseous effluents in an industrial park. As an example of commercial technologies that could later be inserted into military systems, these sensors could be mounted on UAVs to monitor of the chemical/biological environment in an area known to be contaminated or in a stand-off scenario.

Thus each device must be low-cost, have a small footprint (credit card size), and use very little power (using, for example, a watch battery).

The goal is to be able to produce accurate high-resolution short-term (0-12 hr) forecasts for a mesoscale domain (order 102-103 km) in remote regions. Currently models being run in conventional data-sparse regions are initialized using coarse resolution global analyses or forecasts with little if any observational data in the area of interest. Approaches are sought to use non-conventional data sources to provide fine resolution detail of variables that are or can be related to the meteorological variables of temperature, pressure, wind, water vapor, cloud liquid water, and cloud ice. Examples of possible non-conventional data sources include but are not limited to space and ground based, active and passive, infrared, microwave and visible sensors. The enhanced weather and forecast system should be computationally efficient to run fast on a workstation that can be deployed in the field. The ability to deploy to the location where the forecast is needed will give the field forecaster the flexibility to configure and run the system as the situation dictates. Having the system ingest data and run the model at the field site minimizes the data links necessary and allows the forecast to reach the end user faster. Several other organizations are working in the area of mesoscale analysis and forecasting with numerical models on workstations, however none of these groups are focusing on assimilating non-conventional data.

The resultant system would have commercial applications for those interested in the weather in remote regions. Government agencies responsible for monitoring and forecasting radioactive and toxic plume dispersions can use it to respond to releases in remote regions. Commercial aviation interests would be interested in using the improved capability to better forecast flight level winds, turbulence, and icing over remote ocean regions.

For example, the well- known Leonid meteor shower, which occurs annually in mid- November, results from the breakup of the comet Tempel- Tuttle. Superimposed on this annual shower is a 33-year period; every 33 years the shower activity increases greatly. This increased shower activity leads to increased ionization trails and to increased optical emission from meteor metals, because of the larger mass deposition in the atmosphere. The likely effect of this periodicity is that the visible background radiation (airglow and nightglow) will be enhanced a great deal, and the ionosphere will be disturbed in such a way as to cause communications problems for advanced systems. The aim of this SBIR is to develop a code that can be operated on a workstation or a PC to allow the prediction of ionization trails generated by the meteor showers and to predict the optical backgrounds generated by the showers.

Compensated imaging requires active illumination, optical wavefront sensing, and wavefront correction. Even passive sensing requires considerable processing to shape the information into a meaningful form. Often the processing bottleneck of imagery or other data occurs after the detected signals are acquired and are then sequentially communicated to a separate computational processing platform. Novel integrated sensing and processing technology is required to enable real time image correction. Such technology would be capable of detecting and processing data and then correcting or enhancing the image dynamically. Developments in the integrated detection and processing technologies are suitable for example for medical applications or industrial inspection techniques during fabrication or assembly procedures where abnormalities are automatically highlighted in the processed images, generating control or communication response based on the processed information found within the data. Rather than simply producing an enhanced image, the sensor could alternatively generate a response signal based on the information content it has processed from the sensed data. This technology would be suitable for applications where it is too slow or in some other way undesirable to have a person in the system to inspect images. Instead, the internal circuitry of the sensor itself would interpret the significance of information found within the data and then generate a response based on that information.

The membranes on these large telescopes will range in thickness from 10 micrometer to 150 micrometers. This technology is very well suited for deploying an optical system to space, since the membranes can be packaged on the ground and erected after deployment. Traditionally, solid optics with sub-wavelength surface accuracy are used to build diffraction limited telescopes systems. Membrane mirrors cannot be built this accurately. The surface quality of an inflated membrane may initially contain millimeters of inaccuracies. However, the membrane actuation system will allow the membrane figure to be tuned to a more desirable shape. This gives rise to the first area of interest. The surface figure must be monitored while using the membrane actuation system to adjust the figure. The figure will potentially be adjusted to within tens of waves of a diffraction limited surface. The residual error will be compensated by a separate active/adaptive optics system. A second area of interest is optically aligning a segmented primary mirror from the initial deployment inaccuracies to within micrometers of a preferred surface. Initial deployment of a segmented mirror will involve large displacement and rotation errors. Millimeters of translation and milliradians of rotation will certainly be the best possible starting point. Larger errors are expected. Again, the residual error will be compensated by a separate active/adaptive optics system. This topic solicits innovative methods for sensing large systematic dynamic surface aberrations that range from millimeters/milliradians to micrometers/nanoradians and provide continuous output signals that are compatible with an autonomous servo control system. Showing how to measure translations misalignments/aberrations as high as one centimeter or more and a relative rotations as high as one degree or more is a goal for this topic. The metrology system must have the dynamic range to continuously track these errors from the initial deployment inaccuracies to final figure requirements and provide useful output signals while this acquisition and control phase is accomplished. It is not enough that the sensor merely measure the optical aberrations; consideration must be given to its usefulness as a control system sensor. The types of algorithms for the interpretation of the wavefront aberrations from the wavefront sensor output and the conversion of this aberration information to actuator control signals is important. The speed at which these control signals are provided is also important. Small or large aberration detection and its associated control signals should be generated at a rate of 10 seconds or less per figure measurement. The issues of segmented optics verses membrane optics may be quite different. Addressing both problems with the same approach or two separate approaches is acceptable. The response is acceptable even if only one of the two configurations is addressed",464,3104,1,No,No,No,,Design a sensor with the necessary dynamic range and control signal output format that will lend itself to the autonomous type of detection and control described earlier.,"Build, test and validate a laboratory demonstration model or prototype based on the commercial application assessment.","A wide dynamic range optical sensor with appropriate output control signals has commercial potential in the following areas: solar collector surface mapping and tuning, simplifying optical alignment, tuning of theatrical membrane mirrors and automating the mass production of certain optical elements.

Only COIL laboratory demonstration devices are operational. The PL has demonstrated thick steel section cutting with the kilowatt class COIL device. COIL operates at a wavelength of 1.315 microns. This wavelength is readily transmissible through standard quartz optical fiber. The COIL is the only laser which has the unique combination of very high power, extremely good optical quality, and fiber optic transmissibility. There are many environmental remediation applications which are or can be accomplished by first cutting the contaminated facility into small pieces and then hauling those pieces to a waste storage facility. The problem arising from contaminated and spent nuclear reactors is rapidly becoming an international concern since many reactors are now 35 to 40 years old and are reaching the end of their serviceable life. Currently there is no suitable plan to accomplish reactor decommissioning. In the military sector, there are a number of nuclear warheads which require decommissioning by a similar non-invasive technique of cutting into small manageable size pieces for recycling or disposal. The PL believes that a robotically manipulated, fiber optic delivered, transportable COIL system could be the ideal for employment in reactor decommissioning and warhead dismantlement as well as in removal of contaminated industrial-class chemical and nuclear facilities. The PL is interested in a systems-level engineering approach which, in addition to addressing remediation techniques, must also include the development of novel packaging technologies necessary for a transportable, as well as reliable COIL device. Additionally, the required systems engineering would have to include the development of COIL device employment strategies. We anticipate that small businesses interested in pursuing this topic would need to have or must develop access to institutions with resources necessary to actually construct a COIL device based on designs developed by the small business.

Complete the system design. The successful completion of Phase II should provide everything that is necessary to build a robotically manipulated, fiber optic delivered, transportable COIL system to accomplish nuclear reactor decommissioning, nuclear warhead dismantlement and other chemical and nuclear environmental cleanup tasks.","There is a large number of spent nuclear reactors and other environmentally contaminated facilities that require a viable concept for decommissioning, so the commercial market is very large. There is also a substantial number of nuclear warheads which are outdated and beyond their useful lifetime. However, decommissioning is the responsibility of a Federal Agency, and nuclear warhead dismantlement is the responsibility of the Defense Department. The Phillips Laboratory is looking for small businesses with expertise and/or access to expertise in systems engineering as it applies to the development of large-scale high power lasers as well as expertise in environmental remediation. The innovative developments resulting from this SBIR topic also have strong applications in the military community. The military also has spent and/or contaminated reactors which must be decommissioned. The military also is responsible for other contaminated facilities where this technology could be employed in remediation. This technology will also be useful in the demilitarization of strategic facilities and/or weapons systems.

This information is needed to provide insights on how to definitively evaluate, tailor, and optimize the performance of emerging and unforeseen molecules of interest. Suitable techniques must, therefore, have a time-resolution of one microsecond, a broad range of detectable decomposition products (NH3, NO2, NO CO2, organic fragments, etc.) a pressure range beyond one atmosphere, and a temperature ramping capability of ca. 500 K per microsecond. An additional vital requirement is the ability to study low vapor pressure solids, neat ionic solids, and ionic solids dissolved in polar liquids. One promising approach consists of pulsed infrared laser sample pyrolysis coupled with synchronized, step-scan FTIR detection of nascent and evolving species.

The off-axis parabolic concentrator will inflate to a prescribed size and shape. This will allow solar energy to be focused and concentrated (10,000 : 1 geometric concentration ratio) enough to heat hydrogen fuel. Expansion through a nozzle will produce propulsive thrust. If 50 kw is not transferred into the hydrogen fuel, thrust will be insufficient to deliver the payload. In addition, it is imperative that there are no stray rays impinging on the trusses, torii, fuel tank, etc., that might cause catastrophic failure. We are looking for a very simple way to optically test the reflectors before they gather and focus the sun's energy into the engines. It should determine the mean pointing error to nearest 1/4 milliradian. It should determine slope error as a function of position on the concentrator. This is to enable a decision whether to go ahead or correct the problem before a failure occurs. Solar Thermal Rocket Propulsion is the means by which solar powered propulsion systems (two energy-collecting and focusing concentrators integrated with a solar flux- absorbing thruster and using a single tank of fuel) can accomplish inter-orbital, lunar, and interplanetary transfer missions. The reflectors must always be able to track the sun and send the concentrated rays precisely into the respective thruster cavities no matter the direction of rocket travel. The foci of the concentrators will always remain in the same place on the thruster apertures, as a result of the pointing system, guidance and control intervention. The thruster is a dual cavity, dual nozzle device designed to capture the solar energy from both concentrators. The single hydrogen working fluid is heated and expanded indirectly. Hydrogen is transparent to solar flux. By conductive heating from a solar heated material in or surrounding the cavity atmosphere, we can heat the hydrogen gas. Thrust without ignition is produced in the propulsive nozzle and the exhaust gases expelled. A solar rocket doesn't carry its propulsive energy to heat the fuel on board; it receives its energy from the sun in the form of solar flux (free energy). That enables the solar rocket to use different liquid etc., as fuel. Some examples are: helium, argon, and hydrogen. Liquid hydrogen has the lowest molecular weight of all possible fuel candidates. The orbital transfer vehicle, using hydrogen as a fuel, would weigh the least. We are looking for an innovative way to determine the quality of the collector system. We are interested in receiving proposals on any of these related technical areas but will be able to fund only one contract on this topic.",450,2777,1,No,No,No,,"Determine several methods of solving the problem and document them. Perform tradeoffs keeping the weight, volume, cost, complexity, reliability, maintainability, survivability, and deploy ability in mind.

The OQMD test should be performed just before the concentrator system is used every orbit.","Choose which OQMD system best suits our needs. Perform a preliminary, then a detailed design.

For space system applications, micro-engineering holds the key to revolutionize how commercial and military space systems evolve in the future. This new paradigm provides new design possibilities by enabling inexpensive replication of primitive sub-functions and direct access to many quantum mechanical phenomena. Micro-engineering is a multi-disciplinary field with design, material synthesis, micro-machining, assembly, integration and packaging of miniature 2D and 3D sensors, actuators, micro-electronics, and micro-mechanical systems. Such micro- engineering technologies can provide orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity, accuracy, and data storage capability over conventional technology. Micro-engineering technologies of interest include: (a) Real-time Smart Vision Systems consisting of re-configurable electronics for space-based platforms supporting such applications as detection and imaging of military activity, missile warning and battle damage assessment. Having adaptable on-board processing alleviates the down-linking of massive amounts of data for post-processing. These challenges are further magnified when multi-spectral and hyper-spectral remote sensing technologies are considered; (b) Application Specific Integrated Instruments (ASIMs) can replace traditional spacecraft systems or subsystems, combine various traditional functions in new ways, or provide totally new capabilities. In most current applications, the micro-instrument is used as a local miniature ""smart"" sensor. The sensor acts alone with all the decisions and control relinquished to an off-board CPU.

The cost of a highly proliferated LEO system may prove to be prohibitive while the MEO/HEO/GEO option is fundamentally limited by current space launch weight and payload volume restrictions. One way to ameliorate the latter weight and volume limits, and to significantly reduce the cost of system deployment, is to design an imaging payload with a telescope based on sparse, or deployable primary mirror technologies. Sparse, or unfilled, aperture systems can be designed so that the full spatial resolution of a large contiguous aperture telescope can be realized with acceptable losses in light gathering power, or sensitivity. Using state of the art techniques currently under development in the Phillips Laboratory's UltraLITE Project, it will be possible to package very large erectable, or deployable imaging payloads, based upon sparse aperture concepts, within present and envisioned launch vehicle weight and volume envelopes. UltraLITE is a ground based laboratory integrated demonstration of structures, sensing and control subsystem concepts relevant to large, deployable, sparse, or filled aperture telescopes for space-based imaging of terrestrial targets. In concert with a number of related technology activities at the Phillips Laboratory, JPL and elsewhere, UltraLITE is designed to validate most of the critical enabling technologies for this future application. A key remaining unanswered question, which can only be adequately addressed in the natural space environment, is the effect of structural microdynamics, or high bandwidth, hysteretic lurching and resettling in ribs, hinges and joints, on the controllability of the structure to optical wavelength tolerances. The physical scale of the anticipated disturbances, nanometers, and their anticipated high bandwidth characteristics distinguish this phenomenon from larger scale, ""macrodynamic"" disturbances evaluated in previous space structures measurement and control initiatives. This Phase I effort will provide the design of a space qualified flight test article, and the fabrication of a subscale unit ( not necessarily space qualified), which can be incorporated in the UltraLITE ground integration facility. The test article design must incorporate the full range of anticipated structural components, including, as appropriate, joints, plates, ribs, and tubes, and be able to demonstrate representative remote deployment and precision control functions.",400,2807,1,No,No,No,,"Design of a scaleable protoflight experiment to measure and document the microdynamic (high bandwidth, sub- micrometer) environment relevant to a future space-based UltraLITE-derivative operational concept.

Costs associated with hardware integration and flight are not covered under this effort.","a) Military application: Knowledge gained from performing this SBIR may result in designing and building the next generation of space based imagers, space based lasers, etc. b) Commercial/civil application: Remote sensing data sales and services are expected to grow into a $2 billion dollar market by the beginning of the 21st Century. Since the advent of satellite remote sensing, the uses of imagery from space have evolved from more traditional applications such as meteorology, hydrology, cartography, and reconnaissance to more consumer- oriented applications such as insurance claims adjustment, marketing, real estate, and farming. The company that knows how to design and or build deployable optical systems will have the ability to utilize launch vehicles with smaller fairings resulting in substantially lower total system cost. There are two NASA missions that could utilize the technology and know how from this program.

Dramatic reductions in recurring costs and launch costs (through reductions in weight) could make such systems a practical alternative to existing assets, and could enable new capabilities. Recent studies have shown that low earth orbit constellations of phased array satellites, with 6 by 22 meter apertures, operating at 2000 W average RF power are the most likely candidates to achieve near term mission objectives, and be affordable.

Our experience with monitoring satellites suggests that if automated tools exist that allow human operators to focus only on significant events, monitoring performance improves dramatically. We propose to develop technologies for monitoring human behavior by exception; that is, to develop tools for identifying suspicious behavior such as hazardous driving on freeways or antisocial activities on public streets. In the last decade, significant progress has been made in both image understanding and behavior recognition. In image understanding, a large number of well-studied algorithms exist that transform data, locate edges, compute disparities along edges, estimate motion fields, and find discontinuities in depth, motion, color, and texture. Less mature, our scientific understanding of behavior recognition has come mostly from research in case-based reasoning, domain-dependent heuristics, and plan recognition. Recently, many researchers have focused on data fusion techniques because of the large potential of combining information from disparate sources. The standard methodology used in data fusion is to combine raw or low- level data from multiple sensors, using correlation to increase belief in evidence. The drawback of this approach is that it is computationally intensive for large problems and lacks any structure that would improve scalability. An innovative alternative is to impose an architecture that drives processing down to the lowest appropriate level and partition the problem. For example, technologies such as the silicon retina and SPRITE (signal processing right in the element) for visual sensors allows them to provide refined information from images, rather than raw data. Sensing and image processing is not enough to understand whether the viewed activities are acceptable social behavior. Fusion of the specific feature identification into information that can interpret whether a scene is normal or anomalous requires higher levels of image processing and integration.",299,2111,1,No,No,No,,"Address techniques to process the visual information reliably in real time by moving much of the standard image processing tasks onto the focal plane array using silicon retina, pulse couple neural networks and signal processing right on the vision chips themselves. Having adaptable on-board processing alleviates the transmission of massive amounts of data for post-processing. Artificial intelligence technologies need to be applied to high level data to extract features from scenes that need interpretation.","Apply component technologies developed during phase one to prototype behavior monitoring systems in at least two different domains. Develop domain-dependent heuristics and integrate them into a behavior recognition system for identifying suspicious behavior. The ultimate system will have a person-in-the-loop, but will dramatically reduce labor costs by providing the human operator with only information that is more probably worthy of attention. We anticipate a lower error rate as a result.","These technologies will directly support the military's counter-terrorism mission by identifying, for example, explosive devices inside x-rayed packages, snipers positioned in the field, and saboteurs of government property. In addition, a massive market exists for reducing the labor associated with watching commercial surveillance cameras (e.g., stores, prisons, parking lots, airports). Robust vision sensors and data interpretation software that automatically detect and send real time warnings about in-store theft, street drug sales, violent attacks in public, unsafe driving, and auto theft are of interest.",1,"Implementations, New York, IEEE, 1992; Networks: Paradigms, Applications and Hardware; Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1990; Kaufmann Publishers, 1993; Publishers, 1992; 1989; and Electronic Networks, 2nd ed.

For example, analyzed satellite sensor data, weather predictions, etc. contain both 3-dimensional images and an analysis based on uncertainty. Traditional methods for displaying uncertain data (scatter plots, statistical analysis, etc.) are difficult to interpret for users without training in statistics and do not work well with either 3-dimensional or dynamic data. The goal is to research new visualization techniques, new methods of abstraction, and new human computer interfaces for such data. The first step will be to design and implement a software development framework which will simplify the implementation of new visualization techniques. This framework should significantly reduce the time necessary to implement new visualization techniques, allowing new concepts to be easily tested. (Using the current state of the art in software development frameworks, the implementation time for new visualization techniques is prohibitively long.) The next step will be to build a library of visualization components that can be used to implement new visualization techniques, further reducing implementation time.

The proposed research will be a major step towards providing a commercial product for visualizing dynamic uncertain 3-dimensional data such as weather, stock market predictions, demographics, traffic flow models, etc. This product would also provide valuable situational awareness to the warfighter. Much of the information available during wartime is uncertain by nature.

This can be a limitation when a combination of data might yield a bigger picture that is not apparent when the data are taken separately. For example, two different images of the same object may each have valuable information, but the combination of the two could yield new information not present in either image. Similarly, a time-sequenced set of images may illustrate subtle changes not apparent in the single images. In addition to images, there are many other types of data that often need to be interpreted together. For example, satellite weather data and pilot reports. Military and commercial pilots often report anomalous weather. Currently, the reports are manually combined with weather data to form a more accurate report of the weather. The proposed architecture should be able to automatically combine pilot weather reports with the satellite weather information. In the above example, the pilot reports are often only accurate for a short period. The fusion mechanism must be able to deal with dynamic real-time data, some of which may have a short lifespan. The basic goal is to develop a computer architecture that is capable of fusing disparate types of data. Since no programmer could possibly imagine all the different types of data, the architecture must allow new types of data and new fusion algorithms to be added. In addition, since it is not likely that all data can be fused into an easily understood format, innovative graphical visualization mechanisms will be necessary in some (if not most) situations.",264,1609,1,No,No,No,,Investigate the state of the art of information fusion and extract the generalities from existing work to create a prototype demonstrating the feasibility of an open architecture that can implement many existing fusion approaches.,"Complete the architecture design, implement it in software, and then use the architecture to research innovative methods for performing information fusion.

The most immediate military use would be in the areas of situational awareness and battlefield knowledge on demand. Many types of real-time information are available during wartime (e.g. satellite images, historical data, many types of intelligence reports). It is very difficult to fuse this data in real-time into a usable format. The described architecture would lead to better fusion mechanisms, thus providing the warfighter with better knowledge. Commercial applications range from financial analysis to medical diagnosis. In nearly all facets of life, people are inundated with data from many sources.

For example, noise is reduced at a single headset location or only for small numbers of sources contributing narrowband or perhaps multi- tonal input. The Airborne Laser (ABL) program represents a highly complex acoustic environment that includes multiple noise sources outside and inside the aircraft and a large number of noise and vibration sensitive precision optical components. High sound pressure levels are potentially present over a broad frequency range and performance requirements for jitter and alignment on ABL are extremely demanding and distributed over multiple components. Passive means of acoustic compensation are physically limited at low frequency and are not well suited to adapt to changes in the disturbance environment and performance demands during a typical mission. The project will employ advanced noise control techniques that can also be projected to practical automated implementation in an airborne environment with reasonable constraints on weight.

Depending on the launch vehicle, the payloads can be stacked vertically or horizontally. In either case, there is a great deal of coupling |interaction between the payloads, adapter, launch vehicle, and the launch environment. For small class launch vehicles, the environment is extremely harsh with dynamic accelerations at the payload adapter as high at 10-20 g's. Current spacecraft are attached to the launch vehicle through a payload adapter. The adapter is hard-mounted to the spacecraft and launch vehicle and provide no isolation to the spacecraft. As a result the spacecraft must be designed and tested to very high vibration levels, which increases the life-cycle costs of many spacecraft components. The design of a spacecraft requires knowledge of structural and acoustics loads induced by the dynamic interaction with the launch vehicle. These loads are primary inertial, highly transitory, and are functions of the spacecraft, launch vehicle, and external forces. Consequently, the design process is highly interactive. For the spacecraft/adapter/ launch vehicle interface, the government desires a factor of 3 reduction in the dynamic structural borne vibration in the frequency band from 40 to 500 Hz. Also, a factor of two reduction in the dynamic interaction between the payloads is desired.

Currently, satellite operations are expensive, manual, and error-prone. Appropriate industrial engineering and advances in ground stations will undoubtedly reduce these problems, but we anticipate rapid growth in the size and complexity of the space architecture that must be supported by ground operations. Therefore, without a revolutionary change in the concept of satellite operations, we believe manual operations will continue to limit both military and commercial exploitation of space assets.

Current guidance, navigation and range safety systems are expensive to acquire and operate. Expensive navigation grade Inertial Measurement Units (IMU's) are currently used in conjunction with the Inertial Navigation System (INS). Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers could provide the required guidance and navigation data (an approach which would greatly reduce cost) however GPS signal drop out is fairly common. The drop out problem could be solved by augmenting the GPS receiver with a low cost Inertial Navigation System (INS) composed of microelectromechanical (MEMS) produced IMU's. Such a system would not require launch pad alignment and would be orders of magnitude cheaper than current systems. Additional savings may be achieved by elimination of ground radar support to the range safety system. A target GPS/INS unit price is $1000. Up to six units would commonly be used per launch, a redundant pair a) for launch vehicle guidance, b) for spacecraft navigation and c) for range safety. In addition, the MEMS IMU's, once space qualified, could be used for attitude determination on spacecraft. The technology involved in integrating the GPS with an INS involves combining their functionality in an integrated system to provide better system performance than either one acting alone. The integration mechanism must provide a robust algorithm with ability to accommodate momentary blockage of a GPS satellite or degraded GPS performance due to poor user/satellite alignment. Issues concerned with integration of the GPS and INS systems (among others) include: 1) how best to combine GPS with INS, 2) appropriate integration architecture, 3) complexity of integration algorithms required to produce the required level of performance, 4) criteria for INS device design/selection (size/weight/cost/performance) and 5) robust filtering schemes against a) variations in the error characteristics of the individual INS or GPS units (i.e. INS drift, GPS bias, GPS dropout, etc.), b) transient events such as changes in the constellation of satellites being tracked, c) correlated measurement, and d) color or nonstationary nonwhite characteristics for both process noise and measurement noise intensity matrices. Solutions to these issues along with optimal hardware architecture are required to produce the most robust as well as cost- effective GPS/INS product.

This simulation- based acquisition includes studies and analysis, engineering development and manufacture, test and evaluation, training and operations support. However, the current techniques employing model calibration, protocol and data standardization, and incremental patching do not provide an adequate capability to support this multiple application vision. They emphasize syntactic rather then semantic aspects of model integration. Thus the compatibility and consistency problems still remain. One of the key technologies to resolve the problems and enable the DoD vision is the variable resolution simulation. It can provide a unified framework to construct models developed at different levels of details and integrate them into a coherent and consistent family of models to support various stages in the system acquisition cycle. In addition, this technology will enhance interoperability, promote reuse of simulation, and consequently reduce development cost. This research focuses on the development of techniques necessary for the formulation of candidate variable- resolution simulation frameworks. The emphasis are on the generic techniques of designing the correct models and identifying the attributes that can facilitate the cross- resolution interconnection, consistent representation, inclusion of operational software and hardware, and the integration of models for constructive and virtual simulation at various resolution.

Rule-based expert systems are a common technology used to manage this complexity, yet a rule set to be applied to a particular mission is often created in a stand-alone, ad hoc manner. The consequence of this is that rule-based systems are redeveloped each time the system changes. As more complex missions are planned, rule sets will grow and increase in complexity, and become more difficult to develop for new environments. This situation will slow the benefits of exploiting expert system technology. A means to leverage off the existing structure of general purpose and mission- specific rule sets needs to be developed. This problem may be addressed by applying case-based retrieval and analogical reasoning techniques to the management and assimilation of the rules themselves. Rule sets from different expert systems can be viewed as sets of cases. When viewed this way, commercial case-based retrieval (CBR) techniques can be used to assist in the knowledge representation and management of the case-base.

As space- based solar cell power systems degrade significantly in time, satellite systems are sized for a low end-of-life- power (EOLP). Excess beginning-of-life-power (BOLP) is normally shunted and dissipated as heat. Use of this excess power capability in terms of higher radiated RF signal power has been hindered due to poor amplifier efficiencies when the amplifier was required to operate over large variable output power ranges. These inefficiencies also impact the thermal design of the satellite. Major programs such as GPS would reap substantial benefits if BOLP excess power were used to supply higher radiated RF signal power. With launch rates on the order of three to four per year, a significant portion of the constellation would be at the beginning-of- life phase resulting in a higher signal strength to end users. For GPS, the amplifier would have to be a light- weight, have a long-life and be capable of surviving both natural and man-made radiation.

Even in navigation and communication systems requiring the time and frequency accuracy provided by atomic clocks, a VCXO is used as the atomic clock local oscillator. As the crystal oscillator ages, its frequency changes slowly with time; in order to maintain the VCXO output frequency at its set point, its control voltage must be adjusted to compensate for this aging effect. Crystal oscillators on board spacecraft will age through the full mission duration, even if they are not powered during some fraction of the time; thus, VCXO frequency aging rate and tuning range jointly limit mission duration, and adding VCXO redundancy will not remove that limitation. In general, the wider the tuning range of a crystal oscillator, the harder is it to maintain high frequency stability. As an example, if a VCXO is to maintain a relative frequency stability of one part in 1012 over a certain time interval, and it has a relative frequency tuning range of a part in 107, then the crystal's load reactance must be stable to a part in 105 during the same interval, under the full range of operating conditions. This is difficult to accomplish because the crystal's load reactance is affected by stray capacitances and inductances, by the stability of the tuning varactor capacitance vs. voltage characteristic, and by the stability of the varactor voltage. For many specific space applications, currently available VCXO tuning ranges will not reliably support missions longer than about ten years. The restrictions on VCXO tuning range are imposed by the oscillator tuning circuit, and not by the crystal resonator itself. Thus, the restriction on tuning ranges could be relaxed by developing new, possibly more complex tuning schemes (e.g., coarse/fine tuning), enabling significantly longer VCXO mission lifetimes.

Tools for behavioral simulation do not allow access to detailed models of hardware components that ultimately will be used to implement systems. It is the non- ideal behavior of various hardware components that may ultimately limit performance. There is often a need to model certain critical hardware components as they behave in an overall system design. This calls for a heterogeneous modeling technique that can model the overall system at a behavioral, or idealized level, with more detailed modeling of certain selected portions of the system. One example of the non-ideal behavior that might be modeled is intermodulation distortion in non-linear RF circuitry. There are many tools for modeling RF hardware, but an end-to- end system level simulation is not practical within such tools due to the complexity of the representation traditionally used at the hardware modeling level. What is needed is an approach that allows various portions of a system design to be modeled at different levels of abstraction. Different levels of system modeling abstraction usually involve different techniques for model representation and solution. A continuous-time dynamical system might be represented by a set of coupled differential equations. Traditional system-level tools solve the differential equations by approximation with finite- differences. Circuit-level tools like SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) solve the differential equations with an iterative solution technique that is more accurate, but more time consuming. An environment is needed which can support a mixture of representation and solution techniques. Techniques to be considered for this effort would include discrete-event simulation, continuous-time simulation, and RF and circuit- level simulation. A focus of the effort will be the integration of the various modeling techniques. A useful modeling and simulation tool should use graphical techniques for problem setup and results analysis to the extent possible.

Electromechanical gimbal systems currently in use display mechanical wear, vibration, require lubricants, and have limited life. As payload functions expand the need for precise, vibration free sensor gimbal functionality and reliability increases. Current limitations are partly due to the materials, components, and processes that were developed over a decade ago. An innovative, fault tolerant sensor gimbal design (including application of reliable, low- friction bearings and lubricants, if required) is needed to provide more accurate, reliable and cost effective space based sensor gimbal mounts for DoD/NASA/commercial payloads. The recent advances in electromagnetic suspension technology portend an alternative to electromechanical designs in the area of satellite sensor gimbal mounting. Typical two axis sensor gimbal systems are required to handle inertial loads of 5-6 IN-Lb-S2 in elevation, and 15-16 In-Lb-S2 in azimuth, be capable of active travel of +/- 185o in azimuth and -1o to +81o in elevation at an acceleration rate of 2R/S2@2R/S for each axis.

In-situ and remote sensing (radio telemetry) approaches are sought, in addition to other approaches. The primary cause of space based rolling element bearing failure is lack of lubrication. Earliest warning of insufficient lubrication is indicated by temperature and/or vapor pressure rise at the rolling element to race contact area and rolling element to separator pocket interface. Widely used approaches in monitoring rolling element bearing health involve measuring temperature variation of the outer race or bearing housing and/or increase in operational vibration. However, due to the thermal lag involved, these temperature techniques commonly fail in predicting timely onset of lubricant interruption, when measures could be taken to prevent occurrence of catastrophic failure. It has been determined that by measuring the temperature and/or vapor pressure variation in close proximity to the rolling element to race contact area of a bearing, the onset of insufficient lubrication failure can be determined in a manner timely enough that the system can switch to remedial systems before catastrophic failure occurs. Long lasting and wear resistant micro sensors are sought to measure the in-situ temperature and/or vapor pressure of lubricated contacts (within a rolling element bearing) using active and remote sensing approaches. These measurements are desired to be minimally invasive, be located in an area that will minimize thermal and/or vapor pressure response time and operate in the presence of liquid or grease lubricant, in atmospheric or vacuum environment. Such approaches may include (among others) thin film micro sensor technologies, miniaturization of existing telemetry techniques and data and signal processing.

Commonly, these approaches are based on efficient 2-D and 3- D arrangements of electronics, often involving ""multi-chip modules"" (MCMs). As chips are brought closer together, the area/volume power density (and, therefore, heat) increases. It, is conceivable that (unaided) densities of advanced packaging will be such that the resulting heat generated during operation cannot be removed fast enough with conventional heat-sinking schemes to sustain an equilibrium. Two solutions are possible: (1) use extremely dense electronics only in systems which require steady-state operation for SHORT periods of time, or (2) use non- conventional heat removal techniques. The former solution is not acceptable for any space systems that must operate for more than a few minutes. Therefore, it is necessary to consider new heat removal approaches which are tractable for the unique problems of space systems, where within the interior of spacecraft, conductive heat transport mechanisms are virtually the only viable solution for any significant removal of heat. Innovative solutions are sought for this problem: examples to consider include micro-encapsulated, integral, direct liquid cooling systems, heat pipes, and anisotropically conductive substrates among others.

As electronics devices get smaller, they consume less power, but since they are smaller, more of them can be fit into a unit area, and hence the power consumed by an integrated circuit does not necessarily decrease with time. With the advent of two-dimensional multi-chip modules (MCMs), and the increasing interest in three-dimensional MCMs, the power density of a system in area and volume is expected to grow dramatically. Heat density goes up at approximately the same rate as the power density goes up, hence thermal management becomes a paramount factor. Potential solutions include (1) the introduction of various apparatuses to improve the heat removal ability of as-built electronics and (2) lowering the power (and heat generation) of the electronic components. While much attention is beginning to be placed on the first approach, relatively little attention has been placed on the reduction of power in electronic components themselves, other than that which comes about naturally through feature size reduction. If semiconductor components/logic devices were built (utilizing an existing process) that consumed five to ten times less power, then the dissipated heat generated would be reduced by a similar factor. The need, therefore, is for innovative solutions that go beyond increased heat removal of as built electronics, yet minimize the impact on existing semiconductor fabrication processes. On a system level, where millions of such devices would be employed, the savings translates into improved size and weight (and therefore cost) due to the reduction of power and heat. In some cases, these ultra-low power devices would enable systems to be built which were previously inconceivable due simply to the inability to place all of the components within proximity due to the heat dissipation problem. With space systems, furthermore, comes the added complexity of the space radiation environment. Low voltage processes may find that threshold voltage shifts and device leakage currents may render ordinarily low power design approaches useless. Packaging strategies, such as ""tightly coupled MCMs"" can provide an architecture where components are united in a controlled impedance environment. Drivers between components can exploit the significantly reduced capacitance and inductance as compared to printed wiring boards.

For narrow band phenomena, frequencies in the range of 700 MHz to 3 GHz are of interest. Fast transient waveforms with high power and broad spectral content are also of interest. Risetimes of interest are in the range of 10s of picoseconds to 1 nanosecond, and pulse widths from a few hundred picoseconds to 5 Ns are involved.

The four protocols include: (1) an application layer protocol to support file transfers called SCPS-File Protocol (FP); (2) a transport layer protocol to support end- to-end data transmission called SCPS-Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP); (3) a network layer protocol to support internet delivery of data called SCPS-Network Protocol (SCPS-NP); and (4) a security protocol called SCPS-SP. Historically, data transmission protocols such as Transport Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Protocol (IP), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) have been developed with fixed ground applications in mind. Space applications, however, exist in a different operational environment relative to fixed ground applications. For example, most space applications experience constrained bandwidths, higher bit-error rates (BER), dynamic links, higher link delays, and limited computing power onboard the space vehicles. The SCPS protocol suite is being developed to better couple the data transmission protocols to the space environment. It should be noted, however, that the SCPS protocols are also applicable to other non space environments having any or all of the channel characteristics mentioned above.

However, the current phased array antennas employing digital beam-forming networks and phase shift circuits to provide such capability are very expensive. Recently, several low-cost techniques with good performance characteristics such as plasma mirror, row/column steering, liquid crystal/ferroelectric phase shifters, slotted waveguide array, differential rotation of microstrip patch antenna elements, and a number of hybrid techniques to steer RF or laser beams either electronically or mechanically have been developed. These new technologies offer opportunities of investigating the possibility of developing affordable array antennas for cost-effective satellite network operations.

The GPS signals, as received at the Earth, tend to be very weak. This makes them very easy to jam or spoof. RF signals in the GPS frequency band can be openly broadcast and can be used to jam or interfere with the reception of the satellite signals; thus either denying, deceiving, or severely degrading GPS operation. RF transmitters that operate on other frequency bands may produce harmonics of sufficient strength to interfere with local GPS operation. Various mitigation techniques exist, such as adaptive antenna and electronics that null strong jamming signals, adaptive filters that remove narrow band strong signals, and Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) algorithms that detect, isolate, and disregard a false signal (such as a spoofing signal) when computing the GPS solution. However, not all GPS user sets (including civilian uses) will be equipped with sufficient jammer nulling or filtering capabilities, and there is always the risk that a false signal can spoof user sets (even those equipped with RAIM). Thus, instruments need to be developed to detect and precisely locate the coordinates of false signals that interfere with GPS. Once the interfering source has been identified, action can be taken to control it. Weak signals with power of similar magnitude to GPS signals are not able to jam the receiver, but may spoof the receiver. Stronger signals will jam the receiver, but are easier to locate. A single device would generally only be able to determine the direction, but not the range of a hidden interferer. Thus, triangulation techniques may need to be developed that integrate two or more non co-located devices. The problem is very complex for the case of several dispersed jammers or spoofers, each emitting more than one Pseudo Random Noise (PRN) signal. Most of the basic hardware components needed to develop signal location devices are already available; such as fast correlator chips, IMU's adaptive antenna and electronics, and precise clocks.

In particular, the Government hopes to take advantage of the expected explosive growth in Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) during the next decade. These systems may be able to provide services critical to the future warfighter. However, military communication systems generally require a level of security and robustness that are not considered in a commercial system. Specifically, military systems generally require protection against signal interception and exploitation, jamming and deception, and user geolocation. Hence military systems employ such techniques as authentication and encryption, spread spectrum waveforms, and interference rejecting antennas and filters. Systems such as Milstar are extremely secure and robust. In similar fashion, commercial systems must deal with unintentional or self jamming and must provide mitigation against other link degrading phenomena such as multipath fading. As a result, these systems also have some degree of inherent robustness. For example, code division multiple access (CDMA), which will be used by several systems, provides some degree of interference protection. User authentication, necessary to keep non-subscribers from using the system, provides some protection against exploitation and large numbers of satellites (in the constellations being proposed) may even make effective jamming a non-trivial and expensive task.

For instance, using full processing (packet switching and/or circuit switching) instead of partial or no processing. (2) Closer integration and interoperation of military satellite communications systems with commercial communications systems and terrestrial defense communications systems. (3) Prior simulations are generally built from the ground up using programming languages instead of commercial simulation tools. This means they are relatively difficult to modify, compared with those built on top of commercial simulation tools. During the development of future satellite communications systems there will be several traffic analysis simulations needed. For instance, protocol development, failure vulnerability analysis, operations analysis, and user traffic impact studies. Any work to prepare general methods and simulation constructs (code that can be used by multiple simulations) could improve the quality and decrease the time/cost associated with these simulations. Simulation toolkits are required which contain some methodology that leads to the verification of the simulation results. A need exists to define future expected traffic analysis simulations and develop 'toolkits' applicable to many satellite communications simulations. These toolkits should consist of methods and simulation constructs built on top of a commercial simulation modeling tool such as Ontario Provincial Network (OPNET). The toolkits should contain documentation that show how to use these toolkits and that show future simulators how to achieve a simulation end (for instance, protocol development or failure vulnerability analysis).

If a large number of beams or maximum flexibility is required, an all-digital implementation of this beam forming network is worthy of consideration. This requires, however, that the received signals from an array of antenna elements are individually pre-amplified, frequency down- converted, digitized, and then fed into a digital processor, where beam forming and other functions, such as channelizing (demultiplexing and filtering), are performed. Similarly, on transmit, the array must digitally combine multiple beam signals, D/A convert, frequency up-convert and linearly amplify each channel. Multiple agile beams (perhaps in the hundreds) could be simultaneously formed in the digital processor. Each beam could be specially contoured and directed to satisfy a specific regional coverage requirement. Sidelobes could be lowered to permit frequency reuse operation, or even to mitigate RF interference from non users. Each of these capabilities could be implemented with either fixed algorithms, or algorithms having adaptive features. The digital processor architecture should also permit channel and beam assignments to be made with full flexibility. The key performance issues are the availability of enough dynamic range and bandwidth in the A/D converters and the capacity and speed of the digital processor. The viability of digital versus analog beamforming depends not only on performance, but ultimately on the relative impacts on payload size, weight, and especially power.

Current practice is to accomplish this with various electronic signal conditioning, analog-to- digital conversion, and amplification steps. Some type of storage, display, or transmission operation would follow to complete the sensing process. All of these steps can be severely affected by electronic noise; particularly in military environments where radiation, interference, and jamming are common. Incorporating photonics technology into sensor system front-ends offers the opportunity to solve many of these problems. By using light to carry information as early as possible from a detector array, the signal becomes almost impervious to electromagnetic interference. Besides the inherent noise reduction possible with this method, it provides the opportunity for efficient optical pre-processing of target data. In cooled infrared sensors it would also slash the thermal loss that comes from carrying an electrical signal from a cryogenic dewar to an ambient environment. This approach would substantially reduce the weight and power requirements for forward looking infrared sensors, and extend the operation of satellite sensors where consumable cryogenics strictly limit system lifetime. Even more significant is the ability of such sensors to directly interface with the coming light-based digital network. Combined with advances in parallel processing and optical correlation, near real time automatic target recognition will become practicable. This would help bring about a tremendous improvement in battlefield surveillance and global intelligence gathering capabilities. Commercial applications would benefit as well from this technology. The low noise and high speed characteristics of purely optical detector outputs would translate into higher system data throughput. This would be a boon to medical diagnostics, law enforcement operations, and environment monitoring.

The recent research push for interface intelligence attempts to solve the problem by providing complexity abstraction and intelligent assistance in a self- contained software agent that communicates with the user through the user interface. This agent can learn individual user preferences and tendencies to provide automated assistance, thereby acting as an ""intelligent assistant"" or a ""smart instrument."" A complete intelligent interface agent would be collaboratively adaptive to individual users by observing user behavior and collecting behavior metrics such as keystrokes, device utilization, task performance, and application execution. The agent would then store the behavior using a dynamic knowledge representation that recognizes relationships between behaviors and captures uncertainty into a cognitive model of the user. Finally, the agent would act on observed behavior according to user defined levels of assistance through collaborative, multimodal dialogue. Actions can include reorganization of menus and dialogues, streamlining task procedures, performing complex, repetitive tasks, and a myriad of other possible assistance opportunities. Adaptive user interfaces such as GESIA and EDWARD begin to address the usefulness of intelligent interfaces but fail to realize the full scope of possibilities, particularly the importance of developing a generic intelligent interface agent architecture. A generic architecture can serve as a roadmap to widespread adoption into all computer system user interfaces. This quickly emerging technology shows great promise and is a national priority.

The DOD Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), requires an open, standard-based approach offering significant opportunities for reducing cost and cutting development and fielding time through enhancing software portability ease of systems upgrade, and hardware independence. The basis for the JTA is the Defense Information Infrastructure (DII) Common Operating Environment (COE). The COE concept provides for a reusable sense of common software services via standard application program interfaces (API). This concept mandates the use of object-oriented technology in both the analysis and design of current and future systems. Both the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) and the Global Combat Support System (GCSS), which are being built upon the JTA and COE standards, require the migration of legacy command and control systems to these new, unified systems. Successful migration of these legacy systems will require the evolution of those systems to object oriented technology. The advantages of object oriented technology in reusability, efficiency, and development are well-established. What isn't so well established is how one takes advantage of this technology in order to evolve legacy systems or develop new ones. Part of the re-engineering, or even understanding, of any system is the modeling of that system. Modeling techniques mandated by the JTA include IDEF0 for activity modeling and IDEF1X for data modeling. There can be much object-oriented information implicit in such models. Exploitation of such information would allow object-oriented analysis and design, which, in turn, would lead to the building of a new, evolved object-oriented system. The Air Force, then, is looking for methods of extracting object- oriented information from IDEF models and using it to expedite the object-oriented analysis and design of new systems.",299,2016,1,No,No,No,,Design and demonstrate the feasibility of a technique for extracting object oriented data from IDEF models; design and demonstrate a technique for using this data for the object-oriented analysis of an existing system and the object-oriented analysis and design of a future system.,Construct and demonstrate a software tool based on the technique developed in Phase I. Demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.,"This software will be useful in the evolution of any information technology reliant system, whether for commercial or defense applications. The DOD Joint Technical Architecture (JTA), with its foundation in the DII COE, has a great need for such software in the evolution of legacy command and control systems, the development of new command and control systems, and in ensuring compliance of developing systems with DII COE standards. This software could also be highly useful throughout the spiral development process delineated in the Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Command and Control Acquisition Framework. In the commercial sector, similar trends in systems and software development require a tool for object oriented analysis and design of existing and future products. This software would greatly assist the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) process, from requirements and analysis through design and coding. The prevalence of IDEF modeling in the commercial sector testifies to the need to turn conceptual models into real systems. This software will provide the means for accomplishing this transformation.",1,"DII COE, GCCS, and GCSS: http://www.disa.mil/; disa.mil; DOD Joint Technical Architecture: http://www-jta.itsi.","DII COE, GCCS, and GCSS: http://www.disa.mil/; disa.mil; DOD Joint Technical Architecture: http://www-jta.itsi.",3,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/60059/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/60059/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,98.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,USAF,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 11:40:19,,,,,AF98-125_60059,DOD_SBIR_98_P1_C1_AF98-125,,1,2025-08-09 19:54:23.629151+00

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, innovative concepts and technologies in: Global Awareness, Dynamic Planning and Execution, and Global Information Exchange. 1. Global Awareness: Global Awareness encompasses the requirements for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and provides consistent battlespace knowledge and precision information in a global information base. Global Awareness develops the common picture of the battlespace providing enhanced real- time information to the warfighter which is as complete and on demand as required. It entails the operational capability for all pertinent levels of command to know and understand the relevant global military situation on a common, consistent basis. The functional capabilities necessary to achieve Global Awareness are: Consistent Battlespace Knowledge -- The capability to elevate the level and speed of the warfighter's cognitive understanding of friendly, enemy, neutral, and geospatial situations, and to maintain consistency in that view across strategic, tactical and support forces. Precision Information -- The capability to develop and manage sufficient and timely multi-modal operational information to assure an accurate and precise situational awareness to promote Consistent Battlespace Knowledge. Global Information Base -- The capability to acquire, deconflict, fuse, store, maintain, support, and display worldwide operationally relevant data. Specific features include in-time tasking and zooming, consistency, integrity and authentication. 2. Dynamic Planning and Execution: Dynamic Planning and Execution is the operational capability to rapidly acquire and exploit superior consistent knowledge of the battlespace in order to shape and control the pace and phasing of engagements. Dynamic planning and execution encompasses a total warfare planning process from readiness and deployment planning to shooter engagement across the full spectrum of foreseeable military operations. All effort is focused on exploiting a superior understanding of the battlespace in order to shape expected actions within the adversary's decision cycle to proactively engage in rapid, tailorable, planning and execution integrated vertically and horizontally across mission, functions, and organizations. The intent is to construct agile robust plans in which near-real time modifications can be triggered by changes in the battlespace while maintaining consistency and minimizing disruption. The functional capabilities necessary to achieve Dynamic Planning and Execution are: Predictive Planning and Preemption -- The capability to be proactive in the planning process across echelons, missions, components, and coalition forces. These capabilities extend to integrating other than hard kill weapons, mobility, logistics and ISR management into the planning process, as well as planning to anticipate and avoid surprise. The goal is to have a predictive understanding of the battlespace and to exploit it to shape expected actions within the adversary's decision cycle. Integrated Force Management and Execution -- The ability to rapidly interleave planning and execution in order to achieve just-in-time tasking tied to a central strategy that spans the battlespace. The goal is to gain efficiency and agility in the pursuit of the commander's objectives within a dynamic battlespace. Execution of Time Critical Missions and Real-Time Sensor to Shooter Operations -- The capability needed to enable target acquisition, battle management analysis, decision, and resource assignment, and in-time engagement. These requirements extend to a broad spectrum of time critical missions, from time phased attack of fixed and moving targets to the use of hunter-controller-killer assets. Since the C3I decision time cannot exceed the target exposure time, a key capability is C3I time critical operations. Joint, Combined and Coalition Operations -- The capability and enabling decision making infrastructure needed to achieve dynamic synchronization of large scale missions and resources from components and coalition forces. 3. Global Information Exchange: Global Information Exchange is the ability to interconnect all members of the Air Force via a netted communication and information system, available everywhere for any task or mission. The ability to communicate, to move raw and processed information throughout a global communications grid, is fundamental to command and control. Inherent in this capability is the idea of universal information availability across different transmission media with different characteristics. The Air Force's information network must have global reach for its normal day-to-day operations as well as the capability to allow an instant surge of connectivity and capacity into a localized theater for mobile and fixed-site users. The latter capability is the most difficult and costly to provide but is a very critical and important tool for tactical theater operations. The functional capabilities necessary to achieve Global Information Exchange are: Distributed Information Infrastructure -- Providing all mechanisms and services required to allow the commander to craft his C3I information environment, including the ability to establish distributed virtual staffs, to share a common consistent perception of the battlespace, and to construct distributed task teams among sensors, shooters, movers, and command posts. Universal transaction services -- The ability to move information on demand from network to network or link to link without translation or conversion. Assurance of Services -- Providing high quality services the warfighter can rely on to be available whenever and wherever needed, can be adapted, scaled, and be projected to meet dynamically changing demands and service capacities, and can be defended against physical and information warfare threats. Global Connection to Aerospace Force -- Developing and demonstrating technologies for global access to command, control, and intelligence information among warfighting forces.",867,6177,1,No,No,No,,Provide a report describing the proposed concept in detail and show its viability and feasibility.,"Fabricate and demonstrate a prototype device, subsystem, or software program.","Many C4I technologies have substantial dual-use potential and will impact competitiveness and performance of the commercial sector as well as the military sector.

Increased use of video, fax, graphics, images, voice, and textual data make these data types readily available, in different forms, to users.

Sensors of interest include High Range Resolution Radar (HRR) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Advances in high frequency Radar Cross Section (RCS) prediction techniques and Computer Aided Design (CAD) geometry modeling tools and practices are allowing synthetic predictions of tactical targets to be used in ATR development. However, further improvement in the fidelity of predicted radar data is a critical need for advancing ATR technology. This topic solicits innovative solutions in computational electromagnetic prediction for complex targets, CAD geometry modeling, CAD geometry validation and implicit model building. This effort is interested in advancing the state of the art in electromagnetic prediction techniques for complex target geometry models. Efficient models for second and third order scattering mechanisms, hybrid prediction techniques that explore techniques to merge measured data with static predictions and hybrid techniques for integrating low and high frequency modeling techniques are of interest. Stochastic and perturbation techniques that address the technical challenge of augmenting static deterministic synthetic data to reflect the dynamic nature of ATR scenarios, target configuration variation and target intra- class variability are included. Target geometry models can be provided by Wright Laboratory, Combat Information Technology Division (WL/AAC ) for computational electromagnetic model development. Accurate sampling of the target geometry and detailed construction by a specialized modeler are required to build a CAD geometry model for a complex target body. More efficient and accurate methods to improve the current target modeling process is of interest. Currently, target geometry and materials are obtained from technical sources such as line drawings, blue prints, scale models, photographs, and the actual target body which is a repetitive and time-consuming process. We are interested in techniques that will merge these technical sources with the overall CAD geometry construction process into an automated system tool that will significantly reduce the time to produce ATR models. Sampled points from targets of interest can be provided by WL/AAC for CAD modeling tool development. The validation of synthetic radar data is currently a time- consuming tedious process that involves careful visual inspection of geometry models, detailed synthetic/measured comparisons using appropriate error metrics, and trace-back tools from predicted data back to the geometry model. This process is repeated in a serial fashion over as many spatial sub regions of interest surrounding the target as possible. This topic includes efficient synthetic validation techniques that accommodate ATR algorithm performance evaluation criteria. Innovative data analysis and experimental design techniques that address the validation of an N class target set are of high interest. Data and geometry visualization tools are also of interest. While conventional neural networks construct direct input-output relationships that have minimal response time but require extensive training, humans often construct models quickly from a few observations and can make predictions or estimates with considerable accuracy even with coarse models.

Today's UAVs perform primarily surveillance and reconnaissance missions using state-of-the- art sensors and communications subsystems packaged to meet air vehicle size/weight/power constraints. Air Force plans for UAVs show a continuation of the surveillance and reconnaissance missions as well as the addition of communications relay missions in the near-term; these plans also show the addition of suppression of enemy air defenses missions in the mid-term. Other missions such as support jamming, counter cruise missile, and theater missile defense using either armed or unarmed UAVs are also imaginable. Promising, even revolutionary, technologies to mechanize the needed avionics functions will be required. The selection of the avionics functions to perform such challenging missions is driven primarily by the definition of the mission, i.e., the targets, the threats, and the concept of operations (CONOPS). Yet affordability is a major part of the selection process too. The ""Battle Labs"" recently proposed by the Air Force will be the organizations to address CONOPS definition and issues (one of the six Battle Labs is UAV specific). A complementary capability which is needed is the capability to estimate the cost, both research and development as well as production, of revolutionary technologies, a capability that goes beyond today's historically-based cost modeling.

Data associated with sensors for this technology are typically of much higher dimensionality than the underlying information content. Therefore, it is desirable to develop feature extraction techniques to reduce the feature set to optimally represent the observed target. Such a technique should increase the robustness of ATR systems by eliminating features that have little discrimination information. Sensors of interest include radar and EO systems. Specifically, SURV/RECCE radar modes of interest include synthetic aperture radar (SAR), 3-d SAR and moving target high range resolution (HRR). The Air combat sensor of primary interest is HRR radar. EO and multi-spectral (EO&MS) sensors are primarily considered for air-to-ground (A/G) SURV/RECCE and attack. Both active and passive EO&MS systems are of interest. The development of ATR algorithms, based on the extracted features, is required. The feature based ATR algorithms considered may be based on target/sensor physics (such as model based vision), statistical pattern recognition or learning based systems. Systems most desirable will accrue evidence and uncertainty from the feature set to obtain target recognition. In accruing information, a proposer may choose to fuse information from several sources to enhance ATR performance and robustness. ATR fusion options of interest may include, but are not restricted to, fusion of SAR and HRR or SAR and EO&MS for SURV/RECCE, unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) and fighter platforms. For air combat ATR systems, fusion of HRR with other radar modes (such as electronic signal modulation (ESM) and passive non- cooperative target identification techniques) is of interest. Data for the development and testing of the feature extraction and ATR algorithms will be available from WL/AAC. This data includes measured SAR data from several ground vehicles, a limited set of measured A/G HRR for moving ground targets, a large set of HRR for air targets and XPATCH synthetic data corresponding to the measured data.

Current capabilities are not robust and require significant pilot attention for positive CID. The Vincennes Disaster, Desert Storm, and Operation Deny Flight have demonstrated the critical need to positively identify air and surface targets. The destruction of hostile targets while preserving non-combatant, neutral, and friendly aircraft remains a top priority. Identification must positively declare aircraft/vehicle type to enable high-confidence engagement decisions. Class level declarations, whether cooperative or non-cooperative, may be considered viable components of a type level CID system of systems. The primary sensor for CID is radar with an emphasis on airborne tactical radar systems. These systems allow the active or passive collection of multi-mode electromagnetic data which might prove suitable for CID exploitation. CID of air targets is currently performed by signature pattern matching or by performing specialized processing to the radar signature. Other target information in the returned radar signal that is ignored or lost due to advanced processing may provide additional features and characteristics improving overall CID. Similarly, programs exist that provide algorithms and data for stationary ground target location and ID as well as high range resolution algorithms and techniques for detection of ground moving targets. In both cases, there are no all-inclusive predefined sets of exploitable electromagnetic features.

Multispectral discrimination presents an opportunity for significant enhancements in target detectability by exploiting characteristic target spectral (color) features and high background spectral correlation. Results to date under the current program, Brassboard Airborne Multispectral Sensor System Specification (BAMS), have supported this potential of multispectral sensing through extensive spectral measurements and subsequent performance measurements over a range of targets, backgrounds, and environmental conditions. The BAMS program is part of a tri-service research area called the Joint Multispectral Program (JMSP). Other research within JMSP includes developing automatic- target cueing (ATC) and automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms. The performance goals are high probability of detection (> 90%), low false alarm rates (< one per 100 square km) and area search capabilities greater than 10 square km/ minute. The sensor designs should provide the above performances with minimum system cost. As part of the BAMS program, spectral sensor design trades are being refined based on an expanded target/background database. These trades include sensor parameters such as: spectral bands, spectral bandwidths, noise equivalent spectral radiance, band-to-band registration, etc. The output of the effort is a better understanding of the sensor system design trades that result in an operational multispectral sensor capable of supporting the requirement for automatic precision targeting. The objective of this topic is to develop approaches for a affordable, calibrated, optically-registered multi- band image system using available focal plane arrays. These approaches must focus on satisfying the sensor system requirements for high probability of detection and low false alarm rate performance automatic cueing and be compatible with missions from high altitude reconnaissance unmanned vehicles and manned fighters flying above 10,000 ft altitude.

The available evidence, which ranges from sensor reports to natural-language observations, is entirely stochastic, as is the behavior of the targets. Multi-source, multi-target data fusion is difficult partly because two fundamentally different types of observations must be fused: ""precise"" observations (e.g. sensor reports from a radar or electronic surveillance device) and ""ambiguous"" observations (e.g. natural-language reports, rules, and vague attributes). It is usually assumed that these two disparate observation types require very different fusion approaches. Fusion of precise observations is usually based on statistical filtering. That is, new observations are used to update current target estimates using some approximation of the Bayesian discrete-time nonlinear filtering equations (e.g. extended Kalman filters and multi-hypothesis algorithms). Ambiguous observations are usually fused using heuristic ""expert systems"" approaches (e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory, fuzzy logic, rule- based inference) seemingly unrelated to statistical filtering. This effort seeks to place multi-source, multi- target data fusion on a unified footing. The goal will be to demonstrate that precise and ambiguous information can be blended to produce a single quantitative interpretation of the evidence that is both rigorous and coherent. We seek a unified, theoretically defensible, and computationally tractable paradigm that will permit the simultaneous estimation of target numbers, identities and kinematics based on the systematic accrual of all types of evidence. Such a paradigm will help to illuminate situation assessment, which in turn leads to enhanced pilot situation awareness and better response planning. References 1 and 2 have developed probabilistic techniques that show progress towards these goals.

In addition, applications in situation assessment, in threat assessment, and in resource allocation will benefit from using this paradigm. Additional application for evidence accrual abilities is found in a variety of industries and disciplines. Included are mining, medical diagnosis, rescue systems, drug interdiction, ocean exploration, force structure analysis and activity prediction, and air traffic control.",1,"Sensor Fusion, Dallas, Texas, 15-17 March 1995.; Unclassified Proceedings of the 8th National symposium on; Bayesian Evidence Accrural, Los Alamos Report LA-UR-93-3336,; December 1995, p. 1947-52, vol 2. 96-00026; IEEE Conference on Decision and Control, New Orleans LA,; statistics, and information fusion"", Proceedings of 34th; C.

Network Open System Architecture standards such as the industry standard Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Real-Time Scaleable Coherent Interconnect (SCI-RT), will be used more and more to support integrated avionics systems architectures. A set of VHDL models is needed to support top-down design and virtual prototyping of systems with these industry standard network protocols. The set must include: a) performance models that indicate system level timing details for selection and implementation trade-offs; b) functional models which describe the function without timing for virtual prototyping; c) interface models which describe the port structure, the functional, and the timing details for virtual prototyping and interface design; and, d) a synthesizable register-transfer level model which would be used to design a custom interface circuit. Test vectors would be developed and marketed that support all of the models.",161,1111,1,No,No,No,,The preliminary design of the models will be performed and specified.,The models and test vectors will be constructed and verified. Reference manuals and user guides will be developed.,"All models developed under this topic will be inherently dual-use. This is because the same methods used to design military electronic systems are applicable to commercial systems. Similar network architectures are widely utilized in commercial computing systems.Many of the new and evolving weapon systems, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), require highly reliable data communication links to transfer large amounts of digital data. The data can include extremely high resolution imagery, along with other high value data, which could use the Asynchronous Transmission Mode (ATM) format. This type of implementation is extremely sensitive to errors generated in the communication link and, therefore, the communication system must be designed with high link margins. The required high link margins impact the size, weight and prime power consumption (SWAP), and there can be significant cost impacts, ranging from the cost of the communications system to the cost of operating the system long term. Theoretically, new Turbo Codes offer significant improvement over the existing data link code implementations, and should result in reduced SWAP and system life cycle cost. PHASE I: Research the various Turbo Code designs and architectures, evaluate the tradeoffs involved with the various types of codes and the impacts on performance of various data link applications. The specific selection would be evaluated through simulation of critical performance requirements. PHASE II: The selected Turbo Code design would be implemented in VHDL. 0.35u complementary metal oxide (CMOS) would be minimum with 0.25u CMOS being a highly desirable goal. Phase II would include a prototype implementation. PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Significant improvements in communication link performance can result in lower cost, whether in a military or commercial application. The final chip implementation would be for use in data links requiring very low bit-error-rate performance.Innovative eletro-optical device technology should be developed. These devices need to support low cost per function sensing approaches, including RF sensors, EO sensors, and digital technolgy required on board aerospace systems to support sensing or to fuse data from multiple sensors. Electro-optical switching and distribution systems for multifunction EO systems and for true time delay RF phase arrays systems should be considered. Larger focal planes for full situational awareness and multispectral focal planes should be considered. PHASE I: Design new EO devices for the above applications and assess feasibility of developing them, as well as, the payoff in terms of low cost per function sensing. PHASE II: Develop innovative new EO devices designed in Phase I. PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: Commercial applications that will benefit from innovative electro-optic device technological advancements include optical sensors for environmental assessment and/or surveillance, high speed electronics for computers and/or communications systems, and miniaturization components and /or diagnose capability for the medical and/or industry.",1,"States"", IEEE J.

With these airborne systems, amplitude growth has not been a reliable method of determining if a detected source is an approaching missile. However, there is the possibility that some characteristic(s) of a real missile may define it as being an approaching threat and as being uniquely different from a source that is stationary (relative to the ground) and/or is not an approaching missile.

Standard approaches require substantial amounts of heavy equipment and consume a fair amount of power, both of which affect total air platform size and range. With the continued growth in the density of electronics mounted in the vehicles, combined with the operational need to control the infra-red (IR) signature of ground visible surfaces, this problem has taken on a new dimension: the design limit is becoming the ability to reject heat to the environment. This will be especially critical for the next generation of high altitude, long endurance uninhabited air vehicles (UAV). Total heat loads for this class of vehicle are expected to be in the 15 to 50 kW range. Under high altitude conditions air densities are low, thus limiting the convective heat transfer rate. These same conditions, however, allow radiation to a very low black body temperature sink. Coatings and surface treatments exist which allow the emissivity of a surface to vary as a function of radiation frequency, enabling rejection of solar energy while radiating strongly at a longer wavelengths. By combining both convection and radiation into a single platform, the thermal management system can adapt to the sink available at various points throughout the mission profile (e.g., use convection where air densities are high, switching to radiation at lower densities when re-radiation by the atmosphere is less). The system may adapt passively, by allowing the relative efficiency of the two processes to determine the mix, or actively in response to some tactical objective. This technology will be critical for hybrid air/space vehicles.",265,1688,1,No,No,No,,"Analysis and conceptual design work will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of developing a hybrid convection/radiation heat rejection device. This will include analysis of the relative convective and radiative heat sinks available at altitudes of interest to UAV's (0 to 60,000 feet). For radiation, the optimal wavelength (e.g., black body source temperature) for heat rejection as a function of altitude should be determined. The analysis and conceptual design will also address the compatibility of developed concepts with the aircraft and its subsystems. The design will show sufficient technology maturity for orderly development into aircraft systems with compatible environmental factors. The Phase I work will produce a competent technical report and plans for experimental development in a proposed Phase II effort.","This phase continues the necessary analytical work and provides experimental verification of predicted heat rejection capacities for the adaptive convection/radiation device. Laboratory simulation of typical operating conditions will evaluate performance at various altitudes and heat loads. Any environmental restrictions will be assessed. Benefits to be gained from the use of the hybrid system will be quantitatively established for different potential applications to prepare for possible commercial development of the system. A comprehensive technical report will document all of the work conducted, a final optimized design will be completed, and a demonstration device will be fabricated.","Dual-use commercialization will be considered in all phases of this effort.

These typically small, low power requirement devices, allow for localized control of skin friction, heat transfer rate, state of turbulence, and surface shape. Potential applications include reduction of aircraft drag (improved range) through active boundary layer control, wing shaping for improved performance at off-design conditions, inlet shaping for optimal pressure recovery (while maintaining good survivability characteristics), nozzle shaping for area control without mechanical devices, nozzle jet vectoring without heavy moving flaps, nozzle jet mixing for reduction of plume temperature, control of flow noise, as well as control of the damaging acoustic environment and store separation characteristics within weapons bays. Areas of interest include: integration of existing devices into aircraft systems, development of rapid flow control design methods allowing designers to utilize the technologies in tradeoff studies, development of control systems (neural net or conventional) for optimization of the device performance, experimental validation of a potential device, development of a new device, or simulation of the device to elucidate relevant flow physics.",185,1346,1,No,No,No,,"Experimental demonstration of active control device, simulation of single isolated device flow control characteristics, simulation of a flow control strategy, tradeoff study showing optimal sensor/actuator locations.","Demonstration of active device under simulated flight conditions, simulation of bank of devices, implementation of breadboard mockup of control system with sensors/actuators, tradeoff study showing impact of installed devices on mission performance.","Virtually every commercial market which deals with some aspect of flow control stands to benefit from this technology.

A remote operator of a UAV will, at times, need to disconnect the auto-pilot and manually direct the vehicle to achieve mission objectives. The task of manually flying fixed wing UAVs must be made much simpler and easier for remote operators, to require much less training, thereby not requiring UAV operators to be expensively trained rated pilots. Current flight control technology requires a great deal of operator skill and attention to manipulate engine controls, flight controls (in three axes), and supplemental control devices (flaps, speed brakes, spoilers, etc.) while monitoring flight performance and navigation. This effort will explore aerodynamic, propulsion, and control system technology means to simplify the manual flight control task. As an example of a simple low workload concept; a UAV could be designed such that, rather than manipulating throttle and flight control surface position, a remote operator would manually command the turn rate and vertical speed (or gradient) using a yoke or joy stick, with the system controlling the power and flight controls to maintain optimum angle of attack (or the pilot's set speed). The operator would never have direct control of power or attitude, and would never be able to over-bank, stall, or spin. The challenge is to select the appropriate mix of technology concepts to achieve the goal affordably, which is important for application to military UAVs. This simplified manual control approach could also be easily applied to civilian commercial and general aviation aircraft where the control station functions are in place on the air vehicle rather than at a remote location.",292,1878,1,No,No,No,,Explore likely technology options.

Both technologies are key to achieving the flight control technology effort objectives of reduced control system weight and reduced development cost and time for the National Fixed Wing Vehicle (FWV) Technology Program. The state-of-the-art for FBL/PBW is a system that is integrated by an optical data bus, which does not take full advantage of the benefits of photonic technologies. This approach depends upon a weighty Bus Interface Unit, which requires conditioned low level power, as well as, some form of processor. Whereas optical signals have a high tolerance to electro-magnetic interference (EMI), most electro-optic interfaces have high susceptibility to EMI, due to low signal power and high bandwidth. Placing a fragile interface in high EMI, harsh physical environment, such as near an electric actuator, requires circuit hardening in conjunction with robust packaging. A true FBL/PBW system will require a simple, light weight interface where an optical signal provides the control signal to the power electronics of the electrical actuator and the feedback from the actuator and motor controller. The technology gap lies in the immaturity of robust, fully optical effector interfaces (e.g. optically controlled high power switches) and to a lesser degree optical sensors (e.g. current, voltage, pressure, linear position, rotary position, etc.). For electric actuation, fiber optic applications range from accurate control of high electric power switches (i.e. MCT's, and IBGT's) to precision measure of motor and output device position for feedback. The emphasis should be on a total optical actuator interface solution. The ultimate goal is two lanes between the Flight Control Computer (FCC), the actuator and the motor controller; one fiber optic control link and one 270VDC power source.",293,1974,1,No,No,No,,Assess the photonics and power device technology areas and develop a design for the fly-by-light control of an electric flight control actuator.

Improvement of aircraft cruise lift/drag enhances range efficiency directly affecting aircraft size, operating cost and acquisition cost. Increasing cruise L/D is primarily focused on drag reduction, since aircraft lift is tied directly to mission requirements and is not easily altered without impacting critical mission parameters. Modern aircraft design practices tend to minimize the profile, induced and compressibility drag components by sizing the aircraft to accomplish specific missions. The friction, interference and to some extent the wave drag component are not as easily controlled in the design process, however, these drag components can be markedly reduced by the practical application of innovative drag reduction techniques.

The testing must effectively demonstrate the damper's durability in the environment for which it is designed. The Phase II program must also demonstrate that the treatment can provide effective damping without adding excessive weight, cost, or maintenance requirements.","There are several commercial markets for damping technologies that are capable of withstanding elevated temperatures and large steady state loading, including vibration isolation devices for heavy machinery. Damping concepts can also be used in the commercial aircraft and automotive industries to reduce undesirable vibration in vehicular structures and engines. Added damping reduces resonant response, which reduces requirements for maintenance and enables the development of lighter weight, higher performance turbine engines.

The Air Force is looking for innovative approaches to the suppression of fires that include the use of photochemical excitation to suppress fires to eliminate the use of chemicals. One possible way to cause suppression is affect chemical kinetics of critical combustion reactions by exciting critical radicals through exposure to selective intense coherent or incoherent radiation. The excitation and de-excitation of critical free radicals by means of the use of directed energy has been shown to interfere with critical chemical kinetic reactions.

Laminated face plies and special coatings will be needed for many applications, but use of the present day standard laminating procedures will produce finished transparencies with some of the same common failure modes as ""old technology"" transparencies. A common aircraft windshield design is a cast acrylic outer face ply, an interlayer, one or more polycarbonate structural plies, and a protective coating or sacrificial thin ply on the inner surface (cockpit side) of the windshield. Metallic films are sometimes used, often on the inner (cockpit) surface. Leading failure modes for this type of transparency are (1) crazing of the acrylic ply; (2) scratches, gouges and other mechanical damage; (3) delamination of the face ply; and (4) damage to the metallic film. Typical manufacturing has flat polycarbonate sheets laminated to flat as-cast acrylic using interlayer material. The laminate is then bent to the final shape, which stretches the acrylic face ply and creates built-in tensile stress in the acrylic. If used, a metallic film system is applied to the final part. Acrylic has a ""memory,"" and when heated above 225 degrees F by in-service exposures it tries to return to it's original shape, creating additional tensile stress. The stress also tries to pull up the edges of the acrylic, aiding delamination. This ""shrink-back"" characteristic disqualifies acrylic from any aircraft with sustained flight much faster than Mach 2. New manufacturing techniques are needed to lower life cycle costs by reducing or eliminating some of the leading failure modes and increasing durability. Any innovative approach to achieve this objective are encouraged and will be considered. One candidate concept: Cast acrylic in a curved mold, with radius of curvature tighter (more curved) than the final transparency shape. Create the structural plies in their final curved shape or in a more curved shape using some manufacturing process. Metallic films, if used, would be applied to some surface between the polycarbonate and the acrylic. Laminate the curved as-cast acrylic to the structural plies and form the final part. The result should be a face ply with some built-in compressive stress, amount of stress highly dependent upon manufacturing techniques and other controllable factors. Compressive stress in the face ply would greatly inhibit or eliminate both crazing and delamination.",383,2487,1,No,No,No,,"Use analyses and simple coupon tests to evaluate different manufacturing techniques and concepts, devise a feasible manufacturing approach, estimate costs, benefits, and payoffs, and select specific designs/products to make with the new technique.

Many existing in situ monitoring methods (e.g., optical methods) are limited to processes below 800 C, thereby limiting thin-film process thicknesses and rates. Simultaneous rapid assessment of a number of variables controlling ultimate specimen quality such as micro-chemistry, surface roughness, interface quality, grain size, preferred orientation and residual stresses are of particular interest. Future advances in materials research will require near real-time in situ data which can be used to automate materials process modeling and expedite the control of gradient thin-film growth and/or removal. Improvements are needed in sensing and signal processing over a wide range of temperature, i.e., 400 C to 1400 C, via monitoring methods which depend upon fixed time integration (the limitation of ""counting"" statistics, e.g., the Poisson distribution) to achieve adequate signal-to-noise ratios which often preclude real-time monitoring for purposes of process control.",213,1590,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate the feasibility of in-situ sensing across a broad range of temperature and processing (growth and removal) conditions to monitor microchemistry, morphology and stresses of multi-layer thin-film interfaces, i.e., inter-layer and film-to-substrate.

As a result, in late 1993 a USAF Paint Technology Task Force was chartered to establish a strategy for the Air Force paint removal and coating systems of the future. The Air Force Coating System Strategy applies to almost all operational aircraft and identifies aircraft coating system requirements from now until beyond the year 2003. In addition to environmental compliance, the strategy clearly defines long term coating system performance parameters significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art. An advisory panel of internationally recognized experts in the fields of coating technology and corrosion science and engineering from industry and academia, was chartered to study the potential of a basic research contribution to ameliorate the aircraft paint issue leading to recommendations for a programmatic course of action. As result of that study, the following four areas of basic research activity were identified as enabling for the Air Force to meet its stated objectives by the year 2003. 1. Investigation of synthesis/structure/property relationships for surface treatments, primers and matte topcoats. 2. Identification of degradation mechanisms of polymers in matte coatings and subsequent development of appropriate models for performance predictions. 3. Synthesis of advanced materials (polymers, additives, pigments, inhibitors) for new coating systems. 4. Investigation of novel coating removal technology. The Air Force has established basic research programs in the above enabling technology areas with participation by the top researchers in the country. Although there are ongoing activities to address environmental compliance, AF requirements are unique in the areas of 30-year life and removal/reapplication of topcoats. Previous national and international research activities in the above areas lack a fundamentals approach, are somewhat unfocused and do not address requirements unique to the Air Force.

In regard to fuel tank sealants, current matrix materials such as polysulfide, polythioether, and fluorosilicone elastomers all have some weaknesses, as the Air Force still has significant maintenance and repair caused by sealant leakage. For elastomeric fuel tank sealants, adhesion to the aged polyurethane fuel tank coating has been known to be a repair problem for many years. Innovative approaches are sought to develop better matrix materials for sealants. Improvements in adhesion and fuel resistance (low swell) are sought, while maintaining the required low temperature flexibility of -54 C (-65 F) and other sealant mechanical and physical properties. An improvement in sealant thermal/oxidative stability above the current 121 C (250 F) is also desirable for future systems. In regard to gap treatment materials, modern aircraft structures require electrical continuity across the outer skins (outer mold lines) for shielding and radar performance. Aluminum alloy and graphite/polymer composite structures match at gaps that span up to 0.7 cm. Currently, metal particle-filled elastomers such as polysulfides and polythioethers are used to provide the electrical continuity across these gaps. These materials take an excessive time to cure and do not have the mechanical performance to handle the strain levels for the hundreds of flight hours required. Improved gap treatment materials are required that have electrical conductivities at least 0.5 ohm-1-cm-1. In addition, these materials must have 50 percent minimum ultimate elongation across the temperature range of -55 to 120 C while maintaining electrical conductivity. They must be processable at the depot level in less than one hour, and have storage capability of over one year in standard shop environments. While maintaining the required properties of gap treatment materials, improvements are desired in adhesion to composite and metallic materials, in low temperature flexibility and elongation at -55 C (-67 F), in better resistance (low swell) to fuel, hydraulic oil, lubricating oil, and other fluids, in shorter cure times at ambient or near ambient temperature, in longer shelf life for gap material components, or in the development of an inherently conductive gap treatment material.

Currently, these adhesives are typically modified epoxies. The need for refrigerated storage of most existing epoxy film adhesives is often a problem, and limited shelf lives cause a significant amount of these materials to be wasted. Furthermore, most do not process at the lower temperatures desired for on-aircraft repair applications. Two-part epoxy paste adhesives have been qualified for many applications in an attempt to resolve the above problems, however, they are not optimal for other reasons. Mixing of the components must be done in the correct proportions and can entrap air in the adhesive leading to porous bondlines (packaging can help resolve these issues). Also, the mixed pastes have limited pot lives, typically do not process well under vacuum pressure (higher porosity than films), and present a bondline thickness control problem. Finally, most two-part epoxy pastes do not have an optimal combination of shear strength (tested wet at 160 F - 180 F) and toughness (as measured by peel tests). Epoxy film adhesives that can be stored at ambient conditions have shelf lives much shorter than one year when stored at realistic temperatures (up to 90 F for ambient) and/or must be cured at higher temperatures than those desired for on-aircraft repair. Alternate adhesive chemistries, such as acrylics and urethanes, have advantages but do not provide the structural properties required, particularly at higher service temperatures. Efforts to develop epoxy systems using encapsulated curatives have shown promise. However, a film system designed to meet all of the on-aircraft repair requirements has not been developed.

The Air Force is also very interested in the development of thick HTS films on flexible metallic substrates for high current density power applications. Critical to the successful development of this ""coated conductor"" is the development of buffer layers on appropriate metallic substrates to create a textured substrate on which the HTS film may be deposited. This task seeks to encourage the development of optimum buffer materials and innovative deposition processes which can be economically scaled-up to long-length conductors. This topic primarily addresses the development of materials and processing techniques, as opposed to strictly device development. However, devices may be examined as a part of the materials effort to demonstrate the improved properties of the materials.",176,1211,1,No,No,No,,Address process development and initial testing to demonstrate proof of concept.

For example, HTS microwave filters may be used in wireless communication systems to alleviate growing cellular interference problems and improve frequency utilization. Several applications would benefit from the ability to alter the operating frequency of a device or to operate a given device at different frequencies. Commercial applications for HTS thick film coated tapes include motors, generators, transformers, current limiters, and magnetic energy storage.",1,"Vol. 9, no. 3, p. 23, 1996.; Wires,"" R.

These include space and aircraft communications and sensor systems, and coatings for eye protection from laser hazards. Not only are materials with suitable properties necessary, but it must be possible to process these materials into thin-films for devices that optimize their laser resistant properties. This program's goal is to investigate the use of the emerging thin-film deposition techniques based on supramolecular self-assembled architectures. It is desirable to assemble molecules with non-linear optical properties for applications such as optical limiting, as well as linear applications, such as high performance conformal optical filters. This new deposition technique enables one to control intermolecular interactions (energy transfer, charge transfer, information transfer, response transfer, etc.) from the micro to the macro scale. In electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) of thin- films, coatings are deposited layer-by-layer which provides process control at the molecular level. ESA thin film deposition techniques have been investigated as an approach to develop multi-responsive materials for optical applications. This technique provides a means of sequentially controlling the micro and macromolecular structure and morphology of thin films by providing versatility in molecular arrangement. The proposed effort should investigate ESA and/or other self-assembly thin-film deposition techniques that utilize non-covalent mechanisms (ionic, hydrogen bonding, etc.). In addition, the proposed effort can develop new thin-film deposition techniques of NLO molecules to protect against laser hazards.

With the increasing importance of military space operations to the Global Reach, Global Power, and Global Presence capabilities of the Air Force, it is recognized that achieving safe, reliable, affordable, and routine access to, through, and from space will become more important to national security. The Air Force interest in reusable launch vehicles stems from the potential to achieve a 10- fold to 100-fold reduction in annual operating costs compared to existing expendable launch vehicles. Military Space Plane (MSP) is a multi-mission vehicle which has a 2 hour turn about time and can fly anywhere over the earth -- not just a space lift vehicle. To do all this, the MSP must have a cross range ability of 1200 miles and be all-weather capable. These requirements translate to higher temperature, more durable Thermal Protection Materials (TPS) (not tiles and blankets) with oxidation resistant coatings which are field inspectable and repairable. Resultant leading edges and control surface materials (metals, oxidation resistant carbon-carbon, ceramic matrix composites) must withstand the MSP environments and the coatings must protect the hot structure substrate from heat fluxes of 136 W/cm2 (stagnation regions) and be repairable within 2 hours. Moreover, the mass fraction to reach orbit in a single stage is approximately 90%, making advanced materials enabling to meet MSP goals. As an example, composite hydrogen tanks result in a 6% reduction in the tank weight over conventional aluminum tanks and a 40% system reduction through the integration of tanks as a part of the vehicle substructure. To meet the mass fraction and single stage to orbit goals, composite tanks must become less permeable to LH2 (reducing the requirement to carry extra fuel) and be very large (reducing the weight based on higher specific gravity materials). Thus, either leak tight adhesives need to be developed or the tanks will be single piece requiring process techniques which can be completed out of an autoclave. Similarly, composite LOx tanks will dramatically decrease system weight. Light weight, large (greater than 17 M diameter by 30 M long) structures and propellant tanks are required.

The proposals will be evaluated by personnel from Wright Laboratory Materials Directorate and Phillips Laboratory Structures and Controls Division.",433,2851,1,No,No,No,,"Explore coupon level materials for leading edge and control surfaces and demonstrate that they can meet preliminary MSP goals.

The subscale components will be evaluated in an MSP environment; characterized to provide a preliminary database and assessed to determine applicability to meet preliminary MSP goals.,"Structural thermal protection materials and repairable thermal protection systems are crucial to the success of any reusable launch vehicle (RLV). In addition to military interest, NASA and the commercial world are interested in RLV since the potential to reduce launch costs 10-fold to 100-fold compared to the existing expendable launch vehicles. Consequently, the need for durable thermal protection systems and repairable TPS extends beyond MSP. In addition RLV will need over 10,000 pounds of oxidation resistant leading edge materials. Out of autoclave composite and other approaches to light weight LH2 and LOx tanks will enable the success of any single stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle (RLV).",1,ideas.; repairable coatings are omitted to promote new and creative; http://www.plk.af.mil.

The ability to coextrude, or otherwise produce, functionally-graded tubular articles with substantial variation in mechanical and thermal characteristics across the tube wall would greatly reduce the cost and increase the performance of many solid and liquid rocket components. For example, the functionality requirements for solid rocket motors (SRMs) include high hoop-strength and upper use temperature from a case, thermal insulation and ablative protection of the case with insulation, and energetic propulsion capability from a highly filled thermoplastic elastomer, propellant. Example materials to be coprocessed include, but are not limited to, thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers, polymeric nanocomposites, thermoplastic elastomers, and fluorinated thermoplastics. For liquid rocket ducting and tanks which transport and store cryogenic liquid rocket fuels, the functionality requirements include high hoop-strength from an external wall and thermal insulation and barrier protection from an interior wall. One step processing of these materials would lead to a tremendous cost savings over current manufacturing technology. Additionally, coprocessing and/or functional grading will lead naturally to improved adhesion between layers, thus addressing the bondline- failure mechanism which accounts for 40% of solid rocket motor failures. The materials which are best suited for the three functions within the SRM invariably possess much different processing characteristics, most notably melting temperature, rheological properties, and surface properties.

There are several technical challenges associated with this problem. For CFD solutions, there are issues of efficiency and robustness because even inviscid flow solvers can take many hours to converge on high end workstations for a single point-design solution. This is an important consideration because any general optimization algorithm will require many flow solutions to transform the original design into an optimum one. A technical challenge then is developing methods to sufficiently converge flow solutions, while at the same time not overly extending computer processing time. During the optimization process the body geometry is actually changing so that techniques to automatically regenerate grids about the body will also have to be developed.

PMWI can be performed day or night, through dense fog, smoke, and other opaque obscurants that would blind any optical wavelength based sensor.

Metal and plastic (explosive) objects can be observed when hidden from view beneath nets, tents, camouflage, poly-propolene, leather, hard board, and even certain thicknesses of ceramic materials such as sheet rock.

Prior to the investigations performed by WL/MN, PMWI development was being driven by the need to assist large commercial aircraft to make safe landings under adverse, (particularly foggy) weather conditions. Since autonomous landing represents a rather large potential for cost savings (for example overcoming the necessity to shut down a major airport), the cost of the sensor was not a restrictive issue. However, there have been dozens of identified applications, ranging from fire fighting to in-land waterway navigation, that could be greatly enhanced by a cost effective PMWI sensor. These more cost conscious applications typically do not require high-speed, moving picture rate imaging, but only one or fewer frames per second. This greatly reduced speed-of- imaging requirement opens up the possibility of building extremely low cost PMWI sensors. It is believed that greater than a 100 to 1 reduction in cost is possible; a reduction from more than $250,000 per unit to less than $10,000 for most applications. Because the potential commercial market for PMWI sensor is large, unit costs should plummet. With few exceptions, these commercial sensors have direct military application. Since reliability constraints for commercial application will be equally as stringent, the military community could employ commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) systems directly with no need for modification or upgrade of capability.",331,2290,1,No,No,No,,Develop an innovative approach and preliminary design for very low-cost passive millimeter-wave imaging with the widest potential for commercial application.,Produce and demonstrate a prototype of the selected design under realistic military and commercial application conditions.,"The end product for this effort will be a millimeter-wave radiometric (passive MMW) imaging sensor used for a smart tactical autonomous guidance kit for missiles. Personnel from the Armament Directorate have briefed the potential of PMWI technology at several conferences and workshops where Dual-Use was a key item of interest. Knowing the all-weather and material penetrating capabilities of PMWI, most military and commercial applications are readily perceived. There is also direct application to fire-fighting. There are over 100,000 brush and timber fires in the US each year with more than 30% of them greater than 10 acres in extent. An airborne PMWI system could peer down through flames and dense smoke to precisely locate the source or hot spots to which fire suppressants are to be applied. A PMWI system would permit the delivery aircraft to fly through the haze and dense smoke with no fear of collision with metal towers or cables strung between them. Metal objects are extremely bright in the passive MMW imaging region. Fighting building fires, on the other hand, could be greatly aided by viewing internal hot spots from outside the building.",1,"World Center, Orlando, FL, April 8, 1996.; Aerospace/Defense Sensing & Controls '96, Mariott's Orlando; Enhanced Situational Awareness,"" International Symposium on; Belcher, ""Image Flow/Inertial Algorithm Concepts for; Applications II, San Diego, CA. 9-14 July 1995.; Conference on Millimeter and Submillimeter Waves and; Common Denominator Approach),"" SPIE, International; Millimeter Wave Imaging Technology and Phenomenology (A; Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, March 18, 1994.; National Symposium on Sensor Fusion, Sandia National; Autonomous Guidance (STAG) Concepts and Technology,"" 7th; March 15, 1994.; Symposium, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM,; Millimeter Wave Imaging (PMMWI),"" IRIS Passive Sensors; February 22, 1992.; Conference, Naval Post Graduate School, Monterey, CA,; Autonomous Guidance,"" Proceedings, AIAA Missile Sciences; B.

Time resolved spatial and temporal data of complex mechanical systems under load and impact is necessary to verify and validate these new models and simulations. One deficient area is high resolution image data for fragment/target material dynamics and characterization. This effort is to develop new illumination sources for application to digital high speed devices. Recent work in high speed and ultra high speed photography of shock and explosive events using Ruby, YAG, CuV and other lasers, has shown that use of laser illumination can greatly improve image quality and penetration of shock ionization of the surrounding air. Applications include combustion studies, particle field imaging velocimetry, stereo photography, and holography. Current laser technology can only provide 2 to 4 pulses at the Joule or higher output level with a 15 to 30 nanosecond (nsec) pulse. Typical high speed photographic or holographic experiments are up to 1 millisecond long and exposures are in the 1 nanosecond to 1 microsecond (msec) duration. For use with new holographic and electronic ultrahigh speed cameras, higher power visible lasers with either very short (1-2 nsec) pulses at high repetition frequency (1 megahertz) for 250 to 500 pulses, or a higher power level giant pulse for several hundred microseconds to 100 milliseconds is needed. Typical large rod ruby lasers have about a 800 usec maximum extraction time available and this limits experimental data collection based on distance traveled by the test object. Multiple rods or other configurations may be needed to extend the available test duration. For light-in-flight applications the shorter pulse will allow range gated imagery to see through shock and combustion waves.

The core of this methodology must be generic weapon systems based cost models, tailorable and flexible enough to be accessed by tools and techniques used by industry. A WS-ICM framework of integrated cost architectures will be developed for major cost categories of a weapon system by control level, within and among prime and subcontractors. The WS-ICM and its component cost architectures must be designed, constructed, populated, validated and demonstrated to cost experts and program managers from across industry and government. Extensive consideration must be given to building on standards based approaches with compatible historical data interfaces enabling use (for example) of R&D, mods, spares, sustainment, prior best business practices, infrastructure, labor, learning curve data and realization cost factors, etc..

Studies of the detailed combustion chemistry of these fuels have generally been confined to simplified or even simplistic descriptions using spatially homogeneous or one-dimensional reacting flows. However, with advances in computational capabilities, the practice of considering detailed chemical kinetics in multi- dimensional combustion models is becoming more wide-spread. Still, the introduction of detailed chemical reaction mechanisms into complex multi-dimensional fluid dynamics problems for aviation fuels is not practical at the present time. Fortunately, many aspects of combustion in practical devices are controlled by fluid mechanic processes rather than by chemical kinetics. However, pollutant formation, ignition delay, engine efficiency and operation at short residence times over a broad range of conditions, particularly in high-speed aircraft propulsion systems, are all kinetically controlled processes. Thus, simplified reaction mechanisms which have been thoroughly validated must be developed in order to address specific issues arising in realistic combustor configurations. The US Air Force has constructed a kinetic model that includes alkane, alkene, benzene, simple substituted aromatic (e.g., toluene, ethylbenzene, styrene and phenylacetylene) and simple polycyclic aromatic (e.g., naphthalene and indene) molecules (Maurice, 1996).

Many of the goals associated with the Integrated High-Performance Turbine Engine Technology (IHPTET) Program demand revolutionary improvements in combustor characteristics. Nonintrusive, laser-based diagnostic techniques play a critical role in addressing these challenges. Combustion diagnostics provide feedback regarding key performance parameters including combustion temperatures, species concentrations, and other important flow field parameters. The available data is essential for evaluating advanced combustor concepts. In addition, diagnostic techniques are ideal for validating computational fluid dynamics and chemistry (CFDC) codes associated with emerging combustor design methodologies. Multidimensional imaging of key combustion parameters represents one of the most exciting and potentially revolutionary recent developments in the diagnostics arena. Spatially and temporally resolved images of temperature, pressure, velocity, and species concentrations present tremendous opportunities for improved understanding of fundamental combustion processes. This increased understanding is essential to exploring turbulence and improving the performance of advanced combustors. A number of important technologies must be developed to realize the potential of multidimensional imaging. Several of these technologies have been addressed through past SBIR topics targeting novel radiation sources for advanced diagnostics (AF97-183), measurements under actual engine conditions (AF96-170), and ultrafast-laser-based techniques for absolute number density determinations (AF95-188). To complement the sources realized through these and other programs, this topic seeks the development and demonstration of advanced detection technology to provide spatially and temporally resolved time-evolving images of key combustion parameters. For example, modulation/demodulation-based laser diagnostic techniques show great promise for delivering quantitative determination of key combustion species; however, the complications of combusting environments, particularly spurious optical signals and noise, impact the potential of this approach. Topic objectives include specialized developments in image acquisition/detection technology, post-detection signal processing, and data storage and retrieval designed to address these complications. Ideally, proposed approaches should provide quantitative, real-time imaging of key combustion parameters in multiple spatial dimensions.",315,2636,1,No,No,No,,"Experimentally demonstrate the potential for proposed detection, signal-processing, and/or storage technologies to provide improved measurement of key combustion parameters compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Modeling and other computational support of proposed concepts are advantageous but not sufficient for a Phase I effort. Simply proposing a novel detector and/or signal-processing/data-storage device is also insufficient; the potential advantages the proposed device brings to combustion diagnostics applications must be thoroughly explored.","Provide complete demonstration and documentation of the performance gains associated with the detection, signal-processing, and/or storage technology. Ideally, this demonstration should be achieved in conjunction with a combustion application of interest to the Air Force.","The combustor design methodologies validated by using imaging technologies associated with this topic will have tremendous impact on both military and commercial aviation, particularly as these techniques contribute to the development of high- performance/low-emissions combustors. The imaging technologies themselves have tremendous dual-use commercialization potential as well. The recently released National Critical Technologies Report identified the development of imaging sensors among a group of 27 critical technologies that must be vigorously pursued. Specifically, the authors of the report advocate the identification, development, and implementation of imaging technologies for energy, functional-diagnostics, environmental-quality, and national-security applications. Fields of endeavor that stand to benefit from such imaging technology include advanced materials processing (e.g., chemical vapor deposition), biotechnology (e.g., noninvasive ballistic imaging for mammography or early detection of disease), communications (e.g., high-bandwidth optical signal processing), low-light-level detection in national-security applications, and energy and environmental applications (e.g., performance optimization and emission reduction in advanced gas turbine combustors).",1,"Imaging in Reacting Flows"" Opt.

A machine running at higher speed can usually attain a higher power density and lower weight. However, a high power density motor or generator poses difficult technical challenges generally associated with the generation of high heat loads from magnetic and electrical losses and windage. Proposals are solicited which offer ways to either reduce these heat loads, or to ameliorate their effects. Examples of areas of interest include, but are not limited to high temperature windings and potting materials (>400 degrees C, 600 degrees C goal) for switched reluctance machines (SRMs), fault tolerant winding configurations for permanent magnet (PM) generators, non-lubricated active or passive rotor suspension systems (including hybrids) for APUs, and on-line diagnostic approaches for monitoring/controlling APU rotor/bearing system stability. Innovative thermal management concepts are also sought in the areas of conventional and high temperature electronics and actuator cooling. An emerging family of silicon carbide (SiC), silicon nitride (SiN), and gallium arsenide (GaAs) power electronics will operate at junction temperatures >200 degrees C in the near term and >600 degrees C far term. Even though the efficiencies of these devices will be much greater than conventional silicon devices, the power densities will be 4 to 8 times higher. Therefore, even greater power dissipation levels and waste heat fluxes will have to be managed. Passive thermal management concepts for high performance aircraft have the potential of being reliable and simplistic in design, and are therefore preferred. However, such concepts must manage the inherent coupling of transient heat generation and transient acceleration induced forces, and their effects on the cooling performance of the device. For example, as a direct result of aircraft orientation, altitude, and speed, efficient cooling of flight actuation components results in addressing a transient heat generation problem which is coupled to transient accelerations and transient external heat sink conditions. When active cooling is proposed, existing aircraft fluids such as JP 8,polyalphaolefin, 7808, or 5606 must be used, unless that cooling system is conceived as a line replaceable unit (LRU) or is modular. Reduction of initial cost, maintenance, and logistics should be a key objective for all efforts. The effects of altitude or the impact of the use of compressor bleed air must be addressed when air cooling is proposed.

New test methods are needed to simulate the behavior of fuels at supercritical or cracking temperatures that can be used to determine fuel reaction chemistry, kinetics, heat transfer as well as chemical and physical properties at supercritical conditions. Advanced computational fluid dynamic models coupled with fuel degradation chemistry and advanced high temperature fuel system component simulators are required to determine the impact of fuel degradation in advanced aircraft and engine fuel systems. Jet aircraft produce chemical emissions that can be released into the atmosphere at high altitudes. Fuel additives that can be added to jet fuels in small quantities and suppress emissions need to be developed. Advanced emissions measuring techniques that can be used with research combustors to evaluate the effectiveness of these new fuel additives are also required.",249,1647,1,No,No,No,,Demonstrate the feasibility of the technology and to quantify the payoffs for both military and commercial applications.,"Demonstrate the application of the technology, demonstrate a prototype of the technology, validate performance, and quantify payoffs for both military and commercial applications.",All technologies developed under this topic have both military and commercial jet fuel applications due to the similarities of the jet fuels (i.e. JP-8 is commercial Jet A-1 fuel with a military additive package).,1,"Mar 1996.; Chemistry Division Preprints, Vol 41, No. 2, pp. 498-501,; alkane Mixture,"" T.

Typical power systems include motor drives, inverter/converter for switched reluctance starter/generator systems, DC to AC inverters, DC to DC converters, and pulse forming networks. Common to all of these systems are capacitors, which are numerous and are critical in the operation of the system. Today's capacitors are the weakest link in power electronic system reliability and are limited in temperature capability to a maximum of 125 degrees C. Current application temperatures range from -55 to 200 degrees C and some applications may require > 300 degree C operation with superior electrical performance. Attention to lowering the leakage currents, lowering the dissipation factor, increasing the voltage breakdown strength and increasing the dielectric constant over the current performance is desired. For electrochemical capacitors, energy density should approach 20 Wh/L while the energy density for energy storage and pulse power capacitor devices should approach 10 J/g. For DC/AC filter applications, the equivalent series resistance is important and should be kept below 3 milliohms and the drift properties should be held at below 10% over frequency, voltage and temperature ranges.

This area specifically addresses power electronic device/sensor development with the ultimate applications being to satisfy the aggressive electrical power requirements for the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) program. Innovative proposals should address novel power device designs, solutions to processing issues related to WBG device fabrication, ohmic and rectifying contact metallizations, surface passivation/insulating layer development, and materials development and growth. MEA applications demand high-power electronics with high- temperature capabilities for use in power management and distribution (PMAD), actuator motor control, on-site smart sensors, and data bus electronics. These electronics are required to operate reliably at temperatures of 350 C or greater due to the planned elimination of aircraft hydraulic systems which, translates to a reduction or elimination of the primary electronics cooling medium. WBG semiconductor compounds (SiC, III-nitrides and diamond) have been projected to be excellent semiconductors for high power, high frequency and high temperature applications. For applications involving high powers (1000 volt @ 100 amp) and high temperatures (> 350 oC), it is critical, for example in MOS devices, to have thermally stable gate insulators with high breakdown voltages (>1000 volts), no remnant polarization, and a dielectric constant with minimal frequency dispersion. Specific devices of interest include vertical and planar power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFETs), Schottky and bipolar diodes, thyristors, and insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBTs). The primary objective of this topic is to seek solutions to critical issues related to WBG semiconductor power device development, including, but not limited to: 1) growth and characterization of native oxide dielectric insulators, 2) deposition and characterization of alternative dielectric insulators, 3) deposition and characterization of ohmic contacts on wide bandgap semiconductors, 4) ex situ and in situ techniques for cleaning WBG semiconductor surfaces, 5) ion implantation doping, 6) low specific resistivity ohmic contact metallizations with superior thermal stability, and 7) innovative concepts for smart power and optically triggered power switching elements.

Advanced designs are utilizing highly loaded, low aspect ratio, complex shape airfoils in multistage configurations. However, increased loading produces larger blade wakes, resulting in significant aerodynamic and aeromechanical interactions between stages. In addition, increased loading has produced stall margin and efficiency sensitivity to blade tip clearance levels. Aerodynamic and aeromechanical design capability does not fully account for the unsteady interactions, the effects of wakes due to complex airfoil shapes, or the sensitivity to tip clearances that exist in compression systems. Advanced measurement methods that improve the understanding of these phenomena are desired. In addition, innovative concepts that exploit an understanding of these phenomena are needed to meet the demands of future compression systems. Areas of prime technical importance include endwall, wake and secondary flows, time unsteadiness, forced response and mistuning. Obtaining precise secondary gas path flow control will play an increasingly larger role in optimizing engine efficiency, as further gains in the major engine components become more difficult to achieve. Understanding primary and secondary gas path interactions can be critical to the performance of both. Reducing parasitic leakage and seal deterioration, while minimizing air needed for cooling, ventilation, and thrust balancing, is a significant challenge as the secondary gas path environment becomes more extreme.
