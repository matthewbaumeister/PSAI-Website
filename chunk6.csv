Q9 (06/11/2020): What type of surface model data will be provided, a digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM). In other words, will the elevation model contain surface features or be a bare-earth.
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">We will provide DSM. We can also sometimes provide DTM but it isn&#39;t always available at the full resolution. Sometime we can also provide separate DSMs generated from LiDAR first and last return but you can&#39;t rely on this. Let us know what you can take advantage of.</font></font>

Q10 (06/11/2020): Will the input data be analysis ready or should the solution be prepared to perform additional geometric corrections on the source data, such as: orthorectification, mosaicking, image-terrain registration, and/or georegistration?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">The data will be analysis ready.</font></font>

Q11 (06/10/2020): Q 1) You mentioned three testing locations in the online Q&A section, I wonder whether or where we can pull up some sample data with representative target objects for those three locations?
Q2) You mentioned that you will provide 2D 0.5m/pixel resolution aerial imagery and DEM data that aligned up, are  both the elevation data and aerial imagery  2D, not 3D? If 2D, What's the datasets source and characteristic (how much images overlap? how many data points per unit area)? Will you provide the datasets in phase I or phase 2 project?
3) In phase I, you mentioned we might be able to leverage the dataset in the unreal marketplace, I assume this dataset in the unreal marketplace is quite different from the real world satellite image and DEM data to be targeted?
4) The essence of the phase I project is the interaction between the classifier, the inpainter, and the user. Besides the desired result, what's the interface/UI should we use?
A: <font color=""#000000"">1.After contract award, we will provide data for our locations of interest. The example locations are just examples. You are also welcome to augment this data with your own data or data from public sources.</font>

<font color=""#000000"">2.We will provide the data in large images that are aligned. You don&#39;t need to worry about image registration, alignment. A DEM represents the 3D surface as a 2D grid of elevation values. We will also provide aerial imagery.</font>

<font color=""#000000"">3. The terrain datasets won&#39;t come from Unreal Marketplace but from our internal data sources. Unreal Marketplace has high quality models of trees, grass, etc. for free and for sale. The goal of this topic is for you to analyze the terrain data and position the art assets based on the analysis.</font>

<font color=""#000000"">4. <font face=""Calibri"">It&#39;s up to you. In Phase II you need to provide a data import plugin for UE4. Your interface can be made separately using tools of your choice or built into the UE4 editor.</font></font>

Q12 (05/31/2020): Do we need to provide customized 3D models/materials/art assets?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">We expect to use existing high-quality assets from the Unreal Marketplace. You are welcome to make suggestions or provide custom models but this is not the point of this SBIR topic.

Q13 (05/31/2020): Are we required to use the technologies in the references?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">No. The references are inspirational. They show that technologies exist that do the sorts of things we are trying to do.

Q14 (05/31/2020): What data will you provide? Do we need to purchase commercial data?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">We will provide aerial imagery and digital elevation data that are pixel aligned with each other. Other types of data may be fully or partially available, but you may not rely on them being present. Some of these additional types are: aerial imagery at a finer resolution that the elevation; IR imagery; LiDAR point clouds, road vectors. You are welcome to augment from other sources.

Q15 (05/31/2020): Can you provide Training data?
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">We do not have any data available suitable for training.

Q16 (05/31/2020): Can you further explain âAll-or-none rounding to create hard edges is discouragedâ?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You may use hard edges as appropriate, for example the edges of concrete areas, but there won&rsquo;t be hard boundaries between grass and dirt areas. You will need to provide estimated percentage of each terrain in the &ldquo;blend weight&rdquo; outputs. Even things that you might think will have a hard edge might not actually be sharply divided. Consider the difference between new asphalt and old crumbling asphalt with a dirt shoulder (very common in Michigan).

Q17 (05/31/2020): Can you further explain âdeveloping a custom neural net is outside of the scope for Phase I ?
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">We are trying to indicate that you should start with existing technology due to the limited scope of Phase I. Modifications and/or some retraining are acceptable.

Q18 (05/31/2020): Can you provide some example locations?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Our areas of interest are CONUS Military bases, test tracks, and rural areas. &nbsp;Here are some example locations.

In these simulations we measure the performance of soldiers at tasks such as planning and driving. The GVSC interactive ground vehicle simulations are also used for the development of robotic and autonomous systems and the evaluation of these autonomous driving algorithms. It presently takes months to create a geospecific terrain model for use in the simulation largely due to the quantity of area that needs manual creation and touch-up. This is primarily due to our unique requirement for high visual quality (and rendering performance) but only landmark level accuracy for geotypical features. We are using Unreal Engine for rendering our camera views which put some requirements on the structure of the data that we use. The digital elevation model of the terrain surface is a rectangular grid of altitudes in UTM-style coordinate system. Accompanying the elevation data is any number of layers which we use, one each, for grass, dirt, road, etc. Each layer has a single graphical “material” which affects how it drawn and a blend weight image (of the same dimensions as the elevation data) which represents the “weight” of coverage of that material on that part of the map. On top of this terrain surface we place 3D polygon models of bushes, trees, fences, rocks, buildings, etc. Outside of particular areas of interest, we repeatedly use the same models as we only care about the location of a tree not if every branch is in the right place. Specifically we model the terrain type and elevation with a post spacing of .5m-1.0m which we cover with “typical” imagery of grass, dirt, asphalt, etc. at <1cm/pixel resolution. In addition to the re-use of 3D models, large non-navigable areas outside our areas of interest, such as forests and buildings, will modeled as solid volumes with imagery on the sides. While these models don’t necessarily visually match the real objects in the area they must be located in the exact spots as we sometimes replay position data recorded from real vehicles. Existing solutions for generating this data are either too detailed, preventing rendering at interactive speeds, too specific, or accurate only when viewed from a distance. A complicating factor is that we are viewing the scene from the ground at a height of 1m-4m which is close to perpendicular to the viewpoint of commonly available imagery. Aerial imagery looks blurry when shown from a viewpoint that close. This difference in viewing angle leads to a deficiency in 3D model generation algorithms that use aerial imagery (e.g. Google Maps 3D view). The resulting models are misshapen, misaligned, and of insufficient detail when viewed up close and from the ground but otherwise look fine when viewed from above. A secondary failing of areal imagery in our use case is that it is blind to the area under a tree. Drawing a tree canopy on the ground surface is clearly wrong when viewed from low angles. While we can never truly know what is under the tree we need to back fill those areas with plausible terrain. There is a lot of existing research into terrain classification/segmentation which we can use to generate terrain layers. However, these algorithms are unable to look under the trees where we don’t have data yet but need plausible terrain. Classifying the terrain is also important from a driving perspective. While we don’t need to model soil properties, our simplified tire models need to know, broadly, if we’re on asphalt vs. dirt vs. grass. We also don’t need to model geometric features as small as a pot hole. A possible solution to filling in the gaps is inpainting or image healing, akin to Photoshop, but such tools require manual intervention. There is no present tool to automatically identify obscured areas in the terrain and fill them in with plausible data. In addition, some these areas, such as a single tree, will need to be identified and replaced with a 3D model that is not part of the terrain. This SBIR is seeking innovative solutions to the development of realistic terrain models with dimensions up to 8km x 8km with rectangular regions of 5-10 km2 being typical. The solution should be standalone software which accepts as input elevation data and satellite imagery and then generates a visually rich terrain suitable for use in the Unreal Engine. The solution must be highly automated employing classification to generate specific terrain types to include roads, fields, forests, water features and buildings as well as detect, remove, and inpaint the terrain covered by individual trees, cars, people, etc. The solution must provide methods for human-guided interpretation and classification of areas that are ambiguous by means of selective labeling and or morphing. The tool shall allow an adept user to convert convincingly real terrain at a rate of 1 km2/hr.",814,4944,1,No,No,No,,"The vendor shall deliver a prototype system demonstrating the classification/inpainting of terrain. From a 2-D elevation data (height-map) (.5m/px resolution) and aerial imagery aligned to the elevation data, classify/segment the image into terrain types; one lossless greyscale image per type (png, tiff, etc). The input imagery may be at a different resolution than the elevation data with the edges of the data aligned. The output images must be pixel aligned with the elevation data, where white represents 100% coverage or confidence. Considering the low resolution, multiple terrain types for a given spot are possible, for example a patch of thin grass with dirt showing through could be marked as 50% each on their respective layers. Adjusting the weights for improved appearance encouraged. All-or-none rounding to create hard edges is discouraged. (We acknowledge that this is sub-optimal for paved roads.) For certain types representing covered areas, the unknown area underneath will be inpainted with a different terrain type surmised from the surrounding area and similar features elsewhere. For example, the area under a tree will be filled in with grass, dirt, etc. or a combination. The algorithm should also indicate areas that may need to be represented with a new terrain type or otherwise require manual intervention. A user shall have access to intermediate products which can then be adjusted and the following stages of the process re-ran. We expect that solutions will combine and modify existing image processing and classification tools to accomplish the goals. Developing a custom neural net is outside of the scope for Phase I. The essence of Phase I is the interaction between the classifier, the inpainter, and the user. Although we discuss a segmentation/inpainting process, other classifying/fill-in-the-gaps algorithms along with other pre/post processing steps is permitted.","The vendor shall deliver a plugin for Unreal Editor which will import the elevation data and aerial imagery, classify and heal it, and generate terrain elevation model, terrain type layers, unreal rendering blueprints, etc. as necessary to represent the terrain. As part of this process, a user may manually override classification in certain areas and the software must rework the final output based on the changes. For certain movable objects such as people, vehicles will be erased. For areas that represent large objects (trees, rocks, road signs), it will place a representative model in the scene. These 3D models will be user provided but the software must automate the placement. For areas that represent impassible terrain (forests, buildings), a 3D model representing the footprint of the area extruded to a best-guess height will be generated. (This model will be used by an artist as a basis for detailed model which is outside the scope of this project.). Hard edged roads shall be detected, erased, and replaced with a polygonal model. Physics material properties may be provided by the user and if so, the software will attach them to the corresponding terrain. (Software does not need to understand what these represent.)",Military application is for the development and testing of automated vehicles or vehicle functions which are highly dependent on a modeling and simulation environments with geospecific high fidelity terrain/maps that can be generated rapidly. It is for the development and testing of such systems. The U.S. Army GVSC has a critical need for geospecific high fidelity terrain/maps. Commercial application is in the automated driving technology testing and assessment.

A key component of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) operating in Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) is the Army wireless radio data network. The goal of this SBIR topic is to provide the Army with a way to develop and test RAS with a correct representation of the Army wireless radio data network using M&S that includes the 3D terrain with features (e.g. ground material, bushes/trees, roads, buildings) and weather conditions. The simulation should support being able to model the entire network, antennas and military wireless radios so GVSC can evaluate how the wireless radio would operate in a military network during virtual military experiment (e.g. autonomous vehicle convoy, manned unmanned vehicle teaming) using Unreal Engine simulation vs how they would operate in real world with line of distance interference. Army data networks need to work in harsh ever-changing conditions. They can do so through sophisticated radio technologies, though they are not always successful. The Army needs a simulation capability that can predict failures (i.e what is the probability of a packet reaching its destination) in real time during the execution of simulation. Full information of the terrain and weather as well as with respect to all radio sources will be available in real time (or can be pre-calculated as needed). It is expected that a continually updated channel model will be created taking into account relevant aspects, considering multipath, scatter, Doppler, fading models, diffraction, etc. as appropriate. Models of radios used by the Army such as the Persistent Systems MPU5 will use this channel model to determine the likelihood of packet loss, as well as latency estimates. This SBIR is seeking innovative solutions to the development of Radio Network Model as plugin for Unreal Engine. The solution should be able to use the 3D terrain with features along with the simulation’s weather conditions in Unreal Engine to determine how the radio and radio network would be affected.

By combining all the threshold requirements mentioned in the solicitation, in Phase II, is this vehicle expected to be able to travel 15 miles while driving constantly at the speed of 5 m/s (while carrying 100kg of payload), or is the expected transporting speed different from the top speed? For example, should we use a human walking speed to achieve the range of 15 miles instead?

2.	When the vehicle is making a sharp turn, are you expecting that the vehicle should be able to drive at the speed of 5 m/s (for the Phase II prototype) without tipping over, or in this case, slowing down the speed during the turn is OK?

3.	Is there an expected maximum angle of slope that this vehicle should sustain without tipping over?

4.	Based on your answer from the question here, the use of LIDAR is allowed to detect the leader. Can such energy emitting sensors be used for obstacle detection? If not, should we select sensors that also work at night (without emitting energy) or is night time operation out of scope?

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">1. what is the nominal frequency?

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">A: there isn&#39;t one nominal frequency. Different receivers and systems utilize various different frequency sources. For the purposes of the proposal, suggest utilizing standard nominal frequencies such as 10MHz or 100MHz to simplify design and analysis.

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">2. over all frequency offset at room temperature after 2x reflow, and 20 year aging?

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">A: This is not considered a critical requirement. The frequency source is calibrated with a truth source prior to firing. The clock calibration signals provided during &quot;initialization&quot; include a 10PPS signal with less than +/-50ns pulse to pulse jitter on the rising edge of the clock. In addition, each pulse is accompanied by an absolute time mark message referenced to UTC. As long as frequency offset is not larger than a tolerable limit to allow frequency recall, then proposed design would meet mission requirements.

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">A: We don&#39;t have specific requirements for phase noise. These could be derived from the Allan Deviation Curve. Regarding frequency stability, typically we would look for something with better performance than 3*10^-10 (or .3ppb) with a gate of .1 seconds. This is only one point for the full allan deviation curve, but gives an idea of the type of performance we are looking for.

The existing system has demonstrated success leveraging existing algorithms from the handheld detector that it utilizes. However, due to the additional processing power on board the platform and ability to mount sensors to monitor the detector itself, there is potential to develop algorithms to enhance the signal coming from the detector(s). Without the critical size weight and power restrictions of a handheld device, the robotic platform has the ability to process additional data and integrate more inputs. There are opportunities to implement volumetric analysis, enhanced visualization, augmented reality, and machine learning or artificial intelligence to improve the detection capabilities (by learning from past experiences), intelligently integrate signals from multiple sensors (such as ground penetrating radar, pulsed induction, and electromagnetic induction, and relay of that information to the user. Advances in detection algorithms beyond the existing performance can improve the detection capability, increasing the survivability of the system and most importantly the warfighter.

Q2 (06/07/2020): 1.  The total dosage requirement for the sensor is not specified in the solicitation.  Is 500Gy are reasonable target value?

2.    As nuclear survivability is a key performance parameter, would the government provide access to test facilities during the course of this program, Phase I and/or Phase II?  Would the tests be conducted at the governmentâs expense or the proposer has to budget for these tests?
A: <font color=""#000000"">1. The topic is for a sensor technology for a dose rate capability.&nbsp; The topic provides the desired range: background to 100 Gy/hr.&nbsp; Technologies that span only part of that range will still be considered.</font>

Standard radiation detection requirements for the military includes accurate gamma dose rate measures through the entire range of operations (from background to 100 Gy/hr), ability to maintain accuracy over a wide temperature range (-50 C to 55 C), and nuclear survivability [1]. The standard gamma dose rate sensor is the Geiger-Müller tube (or G-M tube). The venerable G-M tube has been the standard dose rate sensor for nearly one hundred years [2]. However, it is expensive for large-scale deployment (an average of $100 per tube), requires high voltage and counting circuitry, and requires several tubes to span the range of dose rates pertinent to military applications. The G-M tube certainly has characteristics beneficial for military applications to include somewhat inherently nuclear survivability, limited temperatures dependence, and very mature technology. In recent years, a number of radiation manufactures have started to use solid-state devices such a photodiodes for dose rate measurements. These detectors offer advantages in cost, size, and power consumption. However, tests have shown that these types of sensors struggle with nuclear survivable, an absolute most for this type of capability for the military. Temperature sensitivity and non-linearity over a wide dose range also affect many of the current solid-state sensors. DoD is concerned that this evolution of the technology for commercial radiation detectors from G-M tubes to the current solid-state devices continues maybe detrimental to the military’s ability to continue to field radiation detectors that are survivable on the nuclear battlefield. The DoD has decided to fund research to develop low-cost gamma dose rate sensors that are suitable for military operations, including fighting and surviving on the nuclear battlefield. The successful result of this SBIR topic would be a dose rate sensor that is: • Low-cost (preferably significantly under $100 per sensor), • Able to accurately deep absorbed dose rate, defined as the absorbed dose rate at a depth of 10 mm in International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) tissue, • Accurate across the dose rate range pertinent for military operations (from background to 100 Gy/hr), • Able to maintain accuracy over a wide temperature range (-50 C to 55 C), • Nuclear survivable, • Very rugged, and • Very attractive to radiation manufactures for use in their radiation detectors for the commercial and medical sector.",399,2601,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate through proof-of-concept experiments that the proposed sensor can measure the radiation dose rate, at least in a laboratory environment. Using the results of the proof-of-concept tests, conduct feasibility study to determine if the proposed sensor will meet the overall requirements for DOD and to predict better its expected performance. Plan for the continued development and testing of the proposed sensor. Update the cost estimation for the fielded system based on realistic material costs, testing requirements, and projected DoD needs. Phase I deliverables will include meetings (at vendor location or telecom) as needed, monthly reports, and a final report with the results from the tasks in the preceding paragraph.","Mature the propose sensor into a prototype system that meets the DoD needs as previously stated. Demonstrate accurate measurement of dose rate throughout the needed range on the prototype systems. Demonstrate and document the prototype sensor’s temperature dependence, nuclear survivable, and ruggedness. Further develop the manufacturing process to ensure quality and reproducibility, while keeping the cost of the final sensor low. Update the cost estimation for the fielded system. Phase II deliverables will include meetings (at vendor location or telecom) as needed, monthly reports, and a final report with the results from the tasks in the preceding paragraph. Additionally, the offeror will deliver three of the prototype systems to the government for further testing.","Refine and validate the sensor technology to ensure the technology meets the U.S. Army’s concept of operations (CONOPS) and meeting the end-user requirements to include ruggedness and environmental stability. Finalize manufacturing process to ensure a low-cost sensor. Transition the new sensor technology to both commercial and military radiation detectors. The end-state of the SBIR is a dose rate sensor that is: • Low-cost (preferably significantly under $100 per sensor), • Accurate across the dose rate range pertinent for military operations (from background to 100 Gy/hr), • Able to maintain accuracy over a wide temperature range (-50 C to 55 C), • Nuclear survivable, • Very rugged, and • Very attractive to radiation manufactures for use in their radiation detectors for the commercial and medical sector. PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The production quantities of the DoD by itself is not enough to continue to sustain and further mature radiation sensor technologies. Therefore, the proposed sensor must be an attractive alternative for use in commercial radiation detectors. This technology has applications in multiple federal agencies and the private sector for identification of and protection from radiation hazards.",1,"Using RADFET for the real-time measurement of gamma radiation dose rate Marko S Andjelković, Goran S Ristić and Aleksandar B Jakšić January 2015 • © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd Measurement Science and Technology, Volume 26, Number 2; H.

A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">Integration may occur in Phase II, but involves authorities outside of the topic author&rsquo;s organization.&nbsp; The system should be designed to support integration into another system, but there are no guarantees that the government will be able to provide GFI until a government transition partner, such as one of Program Manager Offices listed above, are actively involved.

Q2 (06/05/2020): For the Phase II TATRC coordinated field exercise, there are several tasks that the algorithms will need to perceive, all from within a 68W Health Care Specialist's Scope of Practice, as identified in STP 8-68W13-SM-TG. Does the scope in this publication cover the entire range of what the algorithms should recognize? Would it be beneficial for the algorithm to mimic the checklists in STP 8-68W13-SM-TG?
A: The government will develop a detailed &ldquo;test&rdquo; plan to validate the accuracy of determining if the procedures identified in the topic have been performed, and the number of false positives and negatives.&nbsp; The author provided the list of specific procedures as the initial step for a potentially larger line of research to expand the list of procedures.&nbsp; The government provided the Solder Training Publication (STP) to use as a reference.&nbsp; The STP outlines the procedures that are taught to 68W , Health Care Specialists, during their training courses.

A: This stated as intended.&nbsp; The government is not constraining the use of additional computing resources.&nbsp; Although, keep in mind that increased Size, Weight, and Power requirements of a system may ultimately be detrimental to transition into the military environment, dependent on the capability to bear.

Q9 (06/05/2020): For clarification, based on the 2010 Defense Acquisition Guidebook:
Can you clarify that you are expecting TRL 6 at the end of Phase 2 (Representative model/prototype tested in a relevant environment --> multiple medics n=23 testing in medical scenarios to validate accuracy of the perception system)
Therefore In phase 1: we expect to accomplish TRL 3-4 (Analytic and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept --> low fidelity basic integration of COTS technological components)
A: The Phase I specified requirements are in alignment with achievement of TRL 3-4.&nbsp; Keep in mind the topic is looking for development of a component of a larger system, so the future integration work will be at a lower TRL.

The potential for delayed medical evacuations due to anti-access and area denial challenges, poses a difficult dilemma for combat commanders with wounded, sick or otherwise incapacitated personnel and will likely result in periods of prolonged field care (PFC) near the sites of injury pending evacuation windows of opportunity. Such scenarios may require a few organic or attached combat medics to deal with many casualties, minimizing the time spent with each casualty. The DoD and civilian organizations are looking at intelligent systems to provide decision support systems (DSS), closed loop, and autonomous care capabilities to act as PFC force multipliers to enable medics to handle more patients at the same time. However these systems, are heavily data driven. Current data capture systems require hand entry of data which is both time consuming and distracts the medic from providing direct care; while recording patient encounter data (observations, interventions performed, and patient disposition) could wait, treatment cannot. Therefore significant research efforts are underway to provide hands free data entry during PFC. Much of that work is aimed at speech input which itself can distract from direct patient care, is limited to what the medic dictates, and is not conducive to noisy environments. The Army Medical Combat Developer has suggested that medical encounter data be captured by perception systems and interpreted with emerging AI techniques to enable real-time generation of input to on-site medical decision support systems as well as to capture patient encounter data for posting to the soldier’s medical record and forwarding to the next role of care. For such a capability to work, the Automated Encounter Documentation capture would have to be automatic, completely hands free, and capable of working in the dark. Additionally, redundant data storage and analysis on both a local device and in a medical data cloud would be needed to facilitate reliable operation and near-real-time response from DSSs and autonomous care systems during DIL communications, as well as to ensure data would not be lost if the medic’s EUD is lost or destroyed. The use of novel, and multi-modal sensing methodologies is encouraged to automate the capture of a wider range of data elements and to increase data capture accuracy and reliability.",393,2557,1,No,No,No,,"Based on proposed solutions, develop designs to prototype, integrate and demonstrate a proof of concept light-weight perception system that can generate input into mobile medical information systems and decision support systems aimed at providing diagnosis and treatment recommendations to combat medics during prolonged field care or to be stored and potentially forwarded to a government operated medical data cloud for interpretation and upload to the patient’s medical record. The system shall be demonstrated using representative COTS sensors and hardware with the eventual goal of integrating with a system that can be carried by a single dismounted combatant along with other combat equipment. Identify potential datasets to be used for machine learning strategies. Produce a system design including analyses of alternatives for components to be used for prototyping and demonstration during Phase II. Initiate interoperability and integration plans for future hardware implementations using DoD programs such as the Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS).","From Phase I work, develop and demonstrate a perception system that can generate input into mobile medical information systems and decision support systems aimed at providing diagnosis and treatment recommendations to combat medics during prolonged field care or to be stored and potentially forwarded to a government operated medical data cloud for interpretation and upload to the patient’s medical record. In order to accommodate initial prototype software evaluations with soldiers in the field and/or for fielding consideration, final system must be capable of being implemented on highly ruggedized, light-weight military End User Device (EUD) hardware. Develop integration plans for DoD programs such as the government owned mobile medical information system. Demonstrate an operational prototype in a field exercise with medics/corpsmen as coordinated by US Army TATRC. The offeror shall define and document the regulatory strategy and provide a clear plan on how FDA clearance will be obtained. The offeror should plan for Phase III integration of the prototype capabilities with fielded Army or Joint systems. Further develop commercialization plans that were developed in the Phase I proposal for execution during Phase III, which may include exploring commercialization potential with civilian emergency medical service systems development and manufacturing companies. Seek partnerships within government and private industry for transition and commercialization of the production version of the product. Other important considerations for the system concept include: 1) If a separate battery is used, it should be easy and quick to replace the battery in the field. 2) No new or proprietary display devices should be proposed; if a display is needed for the initial human-in-the loop attended or tele-operated prototyping phases, any required display should be designed to use a standard military issued Android End User Device (EUD) such as the Army Nett Warrior or SOCOM Android Tactical Assault Kit. 3) The system shall be designed with respect to existing and emerging medical device interoperability standards. 4) If intra-device communications are involved in proposed prototype capability, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) communications technology (Ref 15-17) is the desired communications protocol in Phase II for connecting component technologies together and/or to tactical radios for remote teleoperations since UWB is being actively pursued as a secure wireless technology with minimal electronic signature for Open Body Area Networks (OBAN) in combat environments. Use of other innovative solutions for providing secure short-range wireless communications in a tactical environment will also be considered for system designs that require wireless intra-device communications. 5) System should adhere to existing military standards based upon the research approach, such as compliance with existing IVAS standards, if exploring a vision-based perception system. 6) This research is not designed to address the development of wireless capabilities. It is focused on development of a perception system. 7) Speech-to-text capabilities will not be considered. 8) Perception systems include but are not limited to vision-based systems. 9) During Phase II field exercise coordinated by TATRC, the perception system be employed by multiple medics using it in medical scenarios (sample size n=32) to validate accuracy of the perception system. The medical scenarios will consist of medical procedures within a 68W Health Care Specialist’s Scope of Practice, as identified in Solder Training Publication STP 8-68W13-SM-TG dated 03 May 2013.

Penetrating combat wounds can be accompanied by foreign body inoculum (metal fragments, rocks, dirt), large zones of bone and soft tissue disruption, nerve damage and localized ischemia (tourniquet/edema), as well as severe hemorrhage with resuscitation (often severe, >10U of 1:1:1 – pRBCs, plasma, and platelets that will systemically disturb overall physiology [immune system dysfunction, some degree of traumatic brain injury (TBI)]). Wound infections will be common in the multi-domain battle space and during prolonged field care; these infections could progress to sepsis. According to the Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines, the initial response to battlefield trauma is to stop major hemorrhage with pressure, tourniquet and wound packing with hemostatic agents along with broad spectrum battlefield antibiotics. The hemorrhage resuscitation, blast and use of tourniquets significantly reduce the efficacy of antibiotics in combat wound infections and topical treatments are urgently needed. Packing combat wounds with hemostatic agents with evaporative or tissue sealant properties in granular form or impregnated gauze appear to be effective topical treatments to control hemorrhage from these wounds (2,3). However, these approaches are not without their limitations in field applications to include incompatibility with brisk bleeding or coagulopathic patients (4,5) and their unsuitability for long term care (>4 - 5 h). While this paradigm was successful in recent operations where medical evacuation to a higher echelon of care was possible within hours of traumatic injury, the conceivable shift in the future battle space requires serious considerations to this evacuation strategy. As a result, the need for aggressive battlefield trauma care technologies that combine good medicine (i.e. better risk-to-benefit ratio) with host-physiology-augmenting innovations are paramount to controlling life threatening external hemorrhage and sepsis for complex battle wounded service members in austere environments that are removed from access to advanced medical care. The ultimate goal of the technology in this request is to augment current technologies available in the market in the form of gauze, gels, polymers, or powder that combine hemostatic agents with antimicrobial agents or analgesics alone. Commercialization of a technology that addresses the multidimensional problems of traumatized tissue biology will accelerate the next generation of innovations that combine tissue regeneration, pain management, and immune modulations to prevent sepsis and hemorrhage while expediting wound recovery. The aim of this SBIR/STTR is to develop a universal combat matrix of choice that may deliver multiple components such as but not limited to anti-microbial agents, analgesics, regenerative agents, immune modulators, hemostatic agents, oxygenating agents, and pH stabilizers deep into infected traumatize tissues to prevent sepsis. When proposing a technology, it is paramount, but not limited to, to consider the factors below: 1) The starting technology plans to have or already has FDA or equivalent clearance for one or more indications 2) The anti-microbial of choice shall cover a wide array of infectious organisms 3) The analgesic of choice can be, but not limited to, non-opioid agents 4) The regenerative and immune modulators of choice can be, but not limited to, proteins, peptides, hormones, small molecules 5) The matrix should stabilize pH and endotherm conditions within the wound bed 6) The composition may include, but not limited to, hemostatic agents, metal ions, lantibiotics, natural products, bacteriophages, antibodies, polymers, nano-fibers 7) Controlled release of agents as a feature (optional) 8) If a wave or magnet based instrument is to accompany a given technology, simplicity of operation and weight will be considered 9) Effortless applications, ability to withstand high-winds, water, hot and cold temperatures and minimal storage conditions will be factored in the nomination process",618,4307,1,No,No,No,,"Given the short duration of Phase I and the high order of technology integration required, phase I should focus on system design, compatible composition selection, and development of proof-of-concept prototypes that address the majority of the requirements of interest. Prototypes may combine “classes” of agents into different “sets” of matrices or formulations with sequential application to reflect the different stages and priorities of wound healing. At the end of this phase, working prototypes should demonstrate feasibility and proof-of-concept using in vitro systems for components of proposed technology and establish “release profile”. This phase should identify a pre-clinical animal model of infection, such as, but not limited to, punctured or open soft tissue wounds against a gold standard treatment for Phase II. Proposals may include different formulations for different phases of infection development and healing. Evaluation must include data for the first 24, 48 and 72 hours at a minimum, if not longer.","During this phase, the integrated system should be refined to enhance proof-of-concept into a product. Further optimization of technology for deep penetration of technology components into traumatized wound bed should be demonstrated during this phase. Qualitative and quantitative outcomes of product with regards to wound healing rate, regenerative properties, prevention of infection, pain control, hemorrhage control, and decolonization by invading organisms must be demonstrated as specific performance characteristics of the product compared to commercially available product. This testing should be controlled, rigorous, and under GLP conditions. Testing and evaluation of the prototype to demonstrate operational effectiveness in simulated environments (i.e. extreme heat, cold, wet environment) should be demonstrated. Here, the selected contractor may coordinate with WRAIR to set up testing sites and models. Stability of product in an austere environment should be evaluated to include extreme conditions. This phase should also demonstrate evidence of commercial viability of the product. Accompanying application instructions, simplified procedures and training materials should be drafted in a multimedia format for use and integration of the product into market. The offeror shall define and document the regulatory strategy and provide a clear plan on how FDA clearance will be obtained at the end of this phase. Offeror should also consider a pre-pre-submission communication with the FDA.","This phase should encompass both large animal models and randomized clinical trials that would require formal IRB approval as well as shelf-life optimization of at least 2 years in austere environments. The ultimate goal of this phase is to develop and demonstrate a technology enabling the prevention of sepsis in wounded service members from infected traumatic combat wounds and control of hemorrhage under prolonged field care with proper regulatory (FDA) clearance for human use. This effort should seamlessly be integrated into the TCCC paradigm of initial response to trauma. Once developed and demonstrated, the technology can be used both commercially in civilian or military settings to save lives.

However, these edge devices offer less computation power than conventional desktop or server computers and the tactical edge networks are bandwidth limited and suffer from intermittent connectivity to higher echelons in contested environment. In addition, exponential growth in mobile sensing technology is generating large amount of content exceeding the ability of individual edge devices to process/store and the network to disseminate them. This requires tactical edge networks to be able to process, store, and distribute content locally using available edge devices. Distributed computing in the commercial networks is based on centralized schedulers where the scheduler allocates tasks to computing devices and they all report back to the scheduler. Cloud or fog computing in commercial network requires fixed computing infrastructure and 24/7 access to the cloud. Today client server paradigm requires connectivity between edge devices and server hosting platforms. Once the dismounted soldiers get disconnected from the server hosting platforms, there is minimal-to-no capability to process, store, and share locally collected information between connected dismounted soldiers. Separately, in the commercial network, the content based networking approach uses client/server paradigm which is not suitable at the tactical edge. In the academic, there is research being conducted in distributed computing, but mostly following commercial network paradigm. To address the challenges at tactical edge, an innovative distributed computing approach is required to that perform computationally intensive tasks to reduce the collected information into meaningful content using machine learning techniques. The unique aspect of this research involves combining distributed computation with a content based networking paradigm to disseminate and store information efficiently across available edge devices for easy retrieval. Techniques within distributed computing that does not rely on centralized scheduler, works on resource constrained edge devices, addresses changes in number of computing nodes and associated resources and bandwidth limitations is required. New and innovative coded computing paradigms needs to be explored to address challenges of changing computing resources as well as metadata generation, distributed hashing, social networking, and role based encryption techniques to store and disseminate content efficiently across available edge devices should be explored.",375,2752,1,No,No,No,,"Explore and design an architecture for distributed computing suitable for tactical edge network.

To provide increased capability in these areas, the Department of Defense has made significant investment in high power IR laser sources. The objective of this SBIR is to leverage the advancing laser technology for IRCM systems by developing a corresponding high-performance infrared fiber technology. Current IRCM laser systems integrate a multi-band mid-infrared laser with a pointer-tracker as a mated pair, comprising a single replaceable unit. The pointer-tracker assembly then directs the laser power to confuse and jam the attacking threat missile. Performance and reliability of current IRCM laser systems in high-power, high-stress environments is limited by thermal and vibration issues due to the use of free-space optics in the laser systems. The potential use of optical fiber to transmit the high-power laser beam to the pointer would create IRCM systems that meet the requirements of Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA), whereby the infrared lasers and pointer-trackers become line replaceable units (LRU) connected through fibers. This would enable IRCM laser systems with simpler vibration isolation, better thermal control, higher performance and reliability, and significant cost reduction (unit, repair, and maintenance costs). Fibers with appropriate composition should be robust and reliable so that they can be made insensitive to temperature changes, vibration, and moisture. Fiber strength and resistance to mechanical damage are also important. Current fiber capabilities at these wavelengths are limited by either water absorption or other losses. In addition, fiber strength and ability to withstand adverse environments is an issue. New technology is required to advance the state of the art in mid-infrared fibers to fulfill emerging requirements. Of particular interest would be methods for providing advanced infrared transmissive materials with high performance characteristics. The ability of the material to withstand representative stresses and survive in the extreme environments found in Army applications is also of interest. The development, characterization and demonstration of fiber production, infrared transmission and advantageous material properties of fibers are key elements of any proposed research. The ability to integrate these fibers with traditional fiber components, such as connectors, multiplexers, other fibers and switches, would be advantageous. Efforts are needed to develop novel approaches to achieving development of these high performance fibers and maturation of the technology and manufacturing base. The end result of this research would be high performance optical fibers to advance the state of the art in mid-infrared laser applications.",413,2903,1,No,No,No,,"Design an approach to produce optical fibers capable of low-loss (less than 0.5dB/m) transmission between 2-6 micron that exceeds the current state of the art. The optical fiber must have the capacity of transmission greater than 100 Watts laser power over 5-meter long fiber with the mechanical properties to operate in military environments (vibration, temperature, and humidity). Demonstration and measurement of physical properties such as fiber strength and resistance to the environment is critical. Since there is more than one wavelength to be covered, the fiber should be able to transmit a broad range of wavelengths (2-6 micron). A clear development path toward manufacturing the new fiber technology must be presented. The Phase I deliverable will be a final report including the initial fiber technology and performance assessment.","Demonstrate production of usable lengths of mid-infrared fiber to transmit high power (> 100 Watts CW) laser output in the 2-6 micron region with less than 0.5dB/m loss and high material strength. The minimum requirement for the constructed and demonstrated fiber prototype is 25W of optical power transmission with low-loss (<0.5dB/m). The transmitted beam shape should be as close as possible to a smooth Gaussian beam, which would typically be launched into it. Survivability of fibers under representative stress (such as applicable Mil-Specs) should be demonstrated. Key factors for this fiber technology are reliability, reproducibility, cost, and transmission characteristics. Required Phase II deliverables will include a fiber prototype, tests in a laboratory environment, and a final report.","Military.

The new fiber technology in the IR wavelengths has potential applications in medical laser procedures, remote bio/chemical detection, and scientific instruments.

The pixel-to pixel variations are typically characterized as differences in gain and offset. The gain parameter refers to the slope of the pixel output (rate of change) response versus the input signal and the offset parameter is a fixed additive value unique to that specific pixel. The non-uniformity issue arises when each neighboring pixel in the focal plane array has a different gain and offset which leads to a fixed pattern noise which can dominate the output video unless it is electronically compensated. A standard method of compensation involves blocking the focal plane array with a known uniform source at different temperatures to measure each pixel’s gain and offset values and then apply these offsets to each pixel on live output video to remove the fixed pattern noise. The downside of this approach is that while the thermal reference source is being used for a NUC the focal plane array is blocked from viewing the outside scene and thereby blinding the operator. The 3GEN FLIR is a new technology for combat vehicles that incorporates a variable aperture mechanism (VAM) inside the cold space of the Dewar to vary the F# to enable the sensor to switch long focal length optics without increasing the aperture size. The aperture mechanism is structured like a conventional iris such as used in photographic camera optics. This means that the change in aperture shape will vary the amount of light flux from a given object source in a controlled and known fashion. By including the VAM in the NUC process to change the incoming photon flux instead of the thermal reference source, the NUC could be performed faster and not block the live image from the sensor operator. This new technique could be applied to a full two point correction calibration at system turn on and one point offset correction during live scene viewing thus eliminating blackout time of the sensor. This Novel NUC approach would eliminate blind time, which is extremely important to the warfighter that is common with the conventional NUC approach that uses thermal reference sources.",371,2241,1,No,No,No,,"Develop the non-uniformity process sequences, algorithm, and performance metrics for one and two point simulated corrections using an in Dewar variable aperture mechanism or similar mechanism in the optical chain without the presence of an active thermal reference source compared to the conventional approach with a thermal reference source.

These Aerostats also possess a Flight Termination System (FTS) that quickly bring the Aerostat to the ground in the event of major events such as a fully severed tether, or deliberate user initiation. Currently, when the FTS is activated, these payloads frequently impact the ground at high velocities. The payloads are often damaged to the point that they become partially or fully Non-Mission Capable (NMC). Mission losses are approximately $ 10 million per year (approximately $ 1,000,000 of payload lost in 10 incidents per year). The typical damage modes of these payloads include: - Impacting the ground with relatively high impact velocities in a direction normal to the ground (i.e. high kinetic energy) - Impacting the ground with a relatively high deceleration rate (i.e. high “g-loading”) - Impacting the ground with a relatively high velocity parallel to the ground (i.e. “scraping”) The APP will be a feature or system on, in, or of the Aerostat, to significantly reduce the level of payload damage and incurred costs.",179,1155,1,No,No,No,,"Generate an APP design concept with a technical feasibility that would lead to an eventual (at Phases 2 and 3) physical manifestation. Multiple (three) concepts are recommended to perform trade-off studies for performance, reliability, and SWAP-C comparisons of the different design concepts. Describe the CONOPS (Concept of Operations) of the design(s). Perform basic, essential Engineering studies that would demonstrate the efficacy of the design (“hand calculations”, MS-Excel worksheets, etc.). Perform simulations or computer modelling (kinematics, kinetics, FEA, CFD, etc.). The main goal of these calculations is to predict the performance of an Aerostat with an APP before it is ever built. For any computations involving actual numbers, sample data can be provided for Aerostats in the 22 to 36 meter range. Some the parameters for these computations will include: - Weight of the Aerostat (W_aerostat) - Lifting capability of Aerostat (L_aerostat) - Weight of the Payload (W_payload) - Weight addition as the result of incorporating an APP system (W_app) - Altitude of Aerostat when activating the APP (z_act) - Prevailing wind velocity at time of APP deployment (v_wind) - Distance from mooring platform (r_MP) To better illustrate the APP objective, several examples of design concepts are presented below. These are for guidance only, and not direction. Furthermore, these in no way shall limit, constrain, or otherwise drive the solution: - Controlled release of Helium to ensure that the Aerostat both touches down at a slow enough velocity but also does not migrate beyond a required distance from the Mooring Platform (i.e. “throttling” of the release valves, using on board GPS and altitude sensors, etc.) - Parachutes, including steerable versions - Inflatable cushions (aka “airbags”) And here is a sample CONOPS: “The Aerostat’s APP system, as the result of an adverse incident or by user input, is triggered. The APP automatically executes an action or sequence of actions which will bring the Aerostat from its initial operating altitude down to ground level, within a defined distance from the Mooring Platform. At the moment that the payloads hit the ground, they have either impacted the ground at a sufficiently low velocity, or have a sufficient deceleration zone so that the g-loading is low and payload damage is minimized. The payloads can be subsequently recovered with a minimum of inspection or repair, re-installed on a new Aerostat, and re-launched to altitude.” As Aerostats are exceedingly weight sensitive airborne vehicles, the total added weight from incorporating an APP shall be less than 10% of the Aerostat’s payload lifting capability. As an example, a typical 36 meter long Aerostat has a payload lifting capability of approximately 1,000 lb.","The Phase II effort would equip and demonstrate a functional APP system on an Aerostat with a minimum 12 m overall length. The following will be some basic functional requirements: - The APP shall be capable of activation both automatically (due to separation of the tether-to-ground connection), or manually from the ground based on user input. - The APP shall ensure that the designated payloads retain Full Mission Capability (FMC) after the APP is activated at an altitude of z_act and the payloads return to an altitude of z = 0 while prevailing winds are at a velocity from 0 to v_wind. For reference, the typical payloads would retain FMC after being subjected to MIL-STD-810 Method 516.8, Procedures IV Transit Drop, VI Bench Handling, and VIII Arrested Landing. - The payloads shall return to the ground within r_MP of the Mooring Platform, in the prevailing winds with a velocity v_wind. - Weight of any new APP components shall be less than W_APP. - The APP shall be capable of protecting payloads up to W_payload. Where mathematical symbols are presented above, the actual values that will be assigned to those symbols will be provided based on the outputs from Phase I.","The goal of Phase III is a fully operational Aerostat equipped with a functional APP system. A full size, 1:1 prototype of the APP shall be constructed and tested. This will be for an Aerostat of approximately 28 m to 36 m overall Aerostat length. PD Aerostats will provide the basic Aerostats, dummy payloads, and the test site for demonstrating APP trials. Values for requirements will be provided at this phase.

Thank you.





Questions:



1.    Can you please provide the interface description for the interface to the HGU-56P helmet (physical and electrical) to be able to adapt cabling to match?



2.    Also we need the specification for the existing earphone (the speaker driver). I found the NSN (5965-01-331-8000) but did not find the spec.



3.    The description of Phase II says âThe ANR solution shall be capable of accepting power between 3 and 5V DC for operation.â while the MIL-E-29581 talks about the more traditional 28V DC power (MIL-STD-704). Is this something unique with HGU-56P?  Please clarify.





Spec Clarification:



Specification sheets?













Any idea where to find these âdetail specification sheetsâ mentioned in the MIL-E-29581?

Army aviation has relied on noise cancelling microphone technology based on performance specification MIL-PRF-26542F for over 20 years. Naval aviators have relied on active noise reduction (ANR) earcups with the same microphone based on performance specification MIL-E-29581 for over 20 years. The Army never adopted the ANR system because the Navy specification calls out Rigid Earcups (paragraph 3.3.2.1.1) which violates the requirement for impact protection in the ear dome to prevent basilar skull fractures. The ANR earcup was considered too heavy and rigid for integration into the HGU-56P. Active noise reduction technology has improved and the electronics for achieving better speech intelligibility has shrunk dramatically since the original Navy specification was released. Commercial headsets commonly used on jets and rotary wing aircraft which incorporate ANR include the Lightspeed Zulu 3 Aviation Headset - GA Plugs: https://www.lightspeedaviation.com/product/zulu-3-anr-headset/ Bose A20 Aviation Headset: https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/aviation_headsets/a20-aviation-headset.html David Clark DC PRO-X2: https://store.davidclark.com/dc-pro-x2-series Improvements among these and other headsets designed to address better passive and active noise reduction include better ear cups which allow sealing the ears even when wearing eyeglasses, lighter weight, reduced size, improved active noise cancellation, automatic gain control, and active equalization. In addition, modern aviation headsets include either a standard interface audio jack or Bluetooth allowing commercial phones to be used while in flight without taking off the headset, something else not core but desired. This solicitation intends to identify an existing commercial solution to provide the best overall reduction in ambient noise reaching the user’s ears while improving speech intelligibility. Threshold improvement requirement is 10% over current sound attenuation of the HGU-56P Aviator helmet. Objective is 30 decibels of noise reduction average across frequencies without removing speech from user as side effect. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, hearing problems such as tinnitus are described by the VA as among “the most prevalent service-connected disability among American Veterans.” Improved hearing protection can not only improve communication, it can reduce hearing loss and the cost of long term veterans benefits paid to our service members.",360,2668,1,No,No,No,,This effort shall identify and test the most promising combination of passive and active noise reduction technology that can be retrofit into the HGU-56P aviator helmet at the least weight and cost. The initial proposal shall identify a solution which provides noise reduction data showing acoustic attenuation of the technology proposed by comparison to paragraph 3.4 of MIL-E-29581 earcup and MIL-PRF-26542F microphone (if proposal includes replacement of microphone). The contractor shall perform a laboratory demonstration in Phase I demonstrating and quantifying noise reduction and speech intelligibility improvement in benchtop tests using two Government furnished HGU-56P helmets. The contractor shall modify one of the helmets with the proposed improvements and perform identical tests using one modified and one unmodified HGU-56P helmet so that comparison data clearly shows performance improvements achieved. Noise reduction shall be measured using a probe microphone method (REAT Method is not allowed). A report shall be provided which details the tests performed and the improvement demonstrated. Speech intelligibility shall be evaluated using the Modified Rhyme Test method (ANSI S3.2-1989). A Noise Reduction Rating shall be produced IAW ANSI S3.19-1974. The contractor shall document changes to the existing earcup and/or microphone specifications which definitize performance improvement. The report shall estimate costs and weight impact of the technology solution proposed. Measurement of real-ear attenuation of hearing protectors shall be performed IAW ANSI S12.6. The current sound attenuation of the HGU-56P aviator helmet when tested IAW ANSI S12.6 is as follows: Frequency (Hz) 125 250 500 1000 2000 3150 4000 6300 8000 Attenuation (Decibels) 17 14 20 21 26 38 37 44 42,"The solution identified in phase I will be applied and tested to meet all requirements of the specifications proposed for update or replacement. As example, if a replacement earcup is proposed, the existing ear cup specification (MIL-E-29581) would serve as a starting point for a new ear cup specification. Likewise, if the microphone is proposed to be replaced, the microphone specification (MIL-PRF-26542F) would serve as a starting point for a new microphone specification. The contractor shall propose written changes for any existing hardware specifications associated with hardware being changed or replaced. All testing shall be performed IAW the updated hardware specifications submitted by the contractor. A summary report at the end of the test shall document all performance improvement of the new solution to include capabilities added to the performance specifications identified in Phase I. If testing shows initial projections of performance differ from actual results, the contractor shall update any product specifications being replaced or updated as necessary. The contractor shall perform bench testing for all ear cup specification requirements on production representative prototypes if the ear cup is being modified/replaced with an earcup equipped with ANR IAW a contractor proposed update or replacement of MIL-E-29581. The contractor shall perform bench testing for all microphone specification requirements on production representative prototypes if the microphone is being modified/replaced with an improved noise cancelling microphone IAW a contractor proposed update or replacement of MIL-PRF-26542. The contractor shall build sufficient quantities of noise reduction solutions and retrofit Government furnished HGU-56P helmets to account for testing all performance requirements in the updated specifications. The new noise reduction system shall be capable of being retrofit into the HGU-56P helmet without special tools. Objective of the replacement solution is to be capable of installation as direct part swap for original component(s). The ANR solution shall be capable of accepting power between 3 and 5V DC for operation. Deliverables will include test plan, test report, updated performance specification(s) reflecting measured improvement in audio performance, minutes for all meetings conducted with the vendor, presentation slides for test readiness review, a white paper detailing the installation cost of the retrofit solution, and a cost report detailing manufacturing cost as a function of helmet quantity from a minimum of 50 and up to 1000 at a time.

Aviation helmets used throughout DOD may find retrofit application for this same solution. Most aviation headsets are designed for fixed wing applications (quiet cockpits) due to their greater density in commercial applications (moving people and cargo).

PM Air Warrior is developing the next generation of body mounted electronics for the aviator. Previous development efforts ran into substantial reliability issues with body mounted cables due to their tendency to flex and crimp far more than what is seen on an air or ground vehicle. Cable and connector issues were a big contributor towards an unsuccessful conclusion of that program. The Rapid Innovation Fund topic “Wireless Air Soldier Power” is developing a power and data hub through which all body mounted cables will be connected. While digital BIT is implemented, analog wire testing is not part of the current design approach. The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) recently polled the development program managers Army wide for feedback on the deployment and use of test equipment designed to identify intermittent faults in electronics. Due to the weight and cost of external support equipment capable of this, plus the training associated with adjusting the results for the equipment under test, an external test set is not desired. Instead, an internal test which allows the user to know if the system has problems prior to mission start is needed providing immediate go/no-go status of cabling which includes assessment of whether wire performance is likely to experience intermittent failures if signals show weak spots. While cable test reflectometers have been around for many years, methods that work with much lower voltage have recently been developed that can test external cables from a central box using an approach integrated inside the box. Research on this includes the following citations: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7903/3efd09b2a44016c5896442a6c13b57586dc5.pdf www.emo.org.tr/ekler/b849cf30f2a2030_ek.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228888052_INTELLIGENT_FAULT_LOCATION_FOR_LOW_VOLTAGE_DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS This solicitation intends to identify existing low voltage cable assessment test equipment and incorporate this technology into a modular chip capable of introduction to a circuit board with the following features identified: (1) Recommend interface for standardized chip to communicate with processor or FPGA. (2) Cable types that can be evaluated (single strand, twisted pair, coax, Twinax, etc.) (3) Upon verification of working system operation after initial installation, perform a baseline assessment of existing cable performance. (4) Upon startup BIT for all subsequent power on to system, perform assessment of existing cables and compare to assessment of initial verified operational cables.

An integrated training environment controller is required which can be deployed across the distributed execution team to support real-time anomaly insertion, track operator actions and assess team readiness for the increasingly complex flight testing programs. The challenge is to develop a tool that is sufficiently flexible to model the ever increasing mission-specific flight test constraints which evolve through the Government’s requirement to produce realistic flight test events and push the developed systems to their maximum performance limits. This requirement, in turn, also impacts the required training cycle and forces a drastic improvement with the training realism and the resulting value of mission rehearsals.

Commonly the output power of diode lasers can be increased by increasing the semiconductor active area. However, a direct consequence is a degradation in the emitted beam quality, which severely limits laser beam propagation. Therefore, broad area diode lasers are not practical solutions for high energy laser weapons. Instead, solutions that can emit at a high power while maintaining excellent beam quality are needed. At the single emitter level, tapered amplifiers have achieved some of the highest output powers (Watts) in the field of diode lasers at brightness levels of 1000 MW/cm(2)/sr, while maintaining near single mode beam characteristics and diffraction limited beam quality in the fast axis [1,2]. Efforts to improve the beam quality of the slow axis have achieved near diffraction limited slow axis performance, and external micro-optics can match the divergence angles and address astigmatism between the two axes. A tapered amplifier is driven by a high quality seed laser, which may be integrated into each amplifier element, or a single seed may supply multiple tapered amplifiers in an active master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) architecture [3]. Realizing an array of tapered amplifiers to produce a high power laser (kW-class power, GW/cm(2)/sr-class brightness) poses two overarching challenges. First, the solution to construct a dense array, e.g. monolithically, needs to address thermal management, wall plug efficiency, seed geometry, and irregularities such as “smile” in the fabrication stages. Tradeoffs between array fill factor, external array symmetrisation and optics, as well as thermal management need to be considered in the context of SWAP and efficiency. Secondly, a method to actively control the phase relationship between N elements, which is necessary to achieve predictable coherent beam combining (CBC) results at high combining efficiencies, needs to be developed. Indeed, the added complexity of phase control at each element may in turn decrease the complexity of the optical path from laser to telescope: beam control methods such as the use of adaptive optics to address atmospheric effects, fast steering mirrors, and associated mechanical and electronic control loops may be addressed by the laser itself through its ability to control the phase at each element at kilohertz speed.",395,2629,1,No,No,No,,"Design the architecture and fabrication technique to construct a kW-class (>=1kW) laser array based on tapered amplifiers.

Furthermore, the design must be complete with a detailed description of the proposed CBC architecture including all hardware components from seed laser to phase detectors, packaging, as well as phase modulation and feedback algorithms to produce predictable and highly stable phase relationships between all elements of the diode array. The design must include a hardware solution for physically combining N elements into a single, coherent, high beam quality, high power laser beam.","Construct a kW-class (>=1kW) laser array based on the design delivered during Phase 1.

However, edge emitting diodes bring about challenges with respect to mode quality, beam symmetry, and the combination of many diodes into high power diode arrays and modules. Surface emitting diodes such as the vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) have many beneficial properties to include advantageous mode quality, beam shape, absence of catastrophic optical damage COD. However, the output power of element emitters is on the order or milliwatts, hence, thousands or diodes need to be efficiently combined to generate high power laser beams. This leads to a complicated and challenging beam combination process. Recently, photonic-crystal surface-emitting lasers (PCSEL) have emerged as potential solution that rivals edge emitting diode lasers in output power while maintaining radially high symmetric beam quality of approximately M2 = 1.1 [1-3]. A properly designed and implemented square-lattice photonic crystal will produce a singularity point, which allows for single-mode two-dimensional wave coupling and hence, two-dimensional broad-area cavity modes for high power lasing. By coupling this two dimensional architecture to radiation modes outside the photonic crystal via diffraction, vertical emission, i.e. a surface-emitted output beam can be realized [4]. The design considerations for a PCSEL need to be explored and understood clearly to inform the trade and implementation space in the context of high energy laser weapons. These design considerations include selections in the photonic crystal structure and fabrication techniques, semiconductor layer design, materials and fabrication, beam mode quality and coherence properties as well as beam shape and divergence angle. Previous academic work promises PCSEL output power on the order of 1 Watt per emitter, and beam quality of M2 < 1.1, which as a combination may outperform current state of the art edge emitting as well as surface emitting diode solutions considered for HEL weapons. Furthermore, forecasting technology advancements suggest that output powers of greater than 10W may be achievable without loss in M2 performance. Additionally, the design freedoms associated with the crystal structure and electrode placement may allow for active beam steering [5].",339,2341,1,No,No,No,,"Formulate the trade-space towards the design and development of high-power, high-beam quality PCSELs through a modelling and simulation (M&S) approach.

A fixed, limited number of projectiles and propellant charges are stored in the vehicle armor. Those projectiles and propellants are pulled from their stowed position by hand and loaded into the cannon using manually&dash;stocked, manually&dash;actuated assisting mechanisms. After the round is fired, which is a separate process with a specific chain of events, the bore is available to be reloaded. At this point, the process can be repeated. This approach is limited by the physical capabilities of the soldiers operating the howitzer. At high rates of fire with large, next&dash;generation munitions, this manual process is expected to be unsustainable.For the next self&dash;propelled howitzer system, the US Army is interested in exploring alternate cannon reloading approaches that enable high sustained rates of fire.

Assured positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) solutions currently rely on acquiring GPS signals, which may not be readily available in increasingly contested environments and therefore may need to hold precise time for minutes to hours. To ease reliance on GPS, long-holdover clocks with cost, size, weight, and power (CSWaP) appropriate for various DoD platforms are necessary to enable mission-critical functions even in contested environments. Focused research over the past 10-15 years has led to portable timing technology advances including miniaturized vapor cell microwave atomic clocks [1] that are now commercially available. The chip-scale atomic clock (CSAC) has impressive stability performance at its size, weight, and power (SWaP), but it suffers limitations in long-term performance due to various drift mechanisms that are currently being addressed through exploration of new physics approaches. Optical atomic clocks have shown superior stability performance [2] but face challenges to being deployed outside of the laboratory, such as technical complexity and reliability in dynamic environments. Certain proposed optical clock architectures [3] have shown relative simplicity over others but have not yet been realized in a form factor that is appropriate for SWaP-constrained platforms nor have they been characterized for long-term reliability in dynamic environments. The goal of this SBIR is to develop and demonstrate an optical clock that provides a combination of performance and CSWaP that currently deployed atomic clocks cannot offer.",244,1720,1,No,No,No,,"* We would like this topic to be Direct to Phase II if possible, and companies must demonstrate maturity sufficient for a Phase II award * Determine technical feasibility of realizing a portable optical clock that can be evaluated for deployment in Army applications.

Projectiles fitting this new paradigm must survive high-g and high-temperature environments; therefore, novel materials with enhanced thermal and mechanical properties are required to meet these emerging needs. Phase Change Materials (PCM) can address these issues by undergoing structural or phase transformations, thus allowing for the absorption of heat or mechanical stress; indeed such materials have been implemented in applications for such a purpose [1, 2]. Typical solid-liquid PCM suffer from several disadvantages [3]; therefore, other approaches such as solid-solid phase transitions and strongly correlated electron systems are attractive due to the reversible nature of their phase transitions [4, 5]. In order to ensure the survivability of internal components under the aforementioned extreme conditions, novel material design approaches are required to enable novel and/or passive coatings for LRPF platforms. To this end, this topic seeks novel solutions exploiting the phase change properties of materials in order to provide platform protection against a broad range of extreme environmental threats that are unique to the LRPF mission.",185,1299,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will focus on designing hierarchical PCM that can be synthesized and implemented as passive/active coatings or structural elements to enhance the survivability of LRPF platforms against extreme environments. The design should be informed by fundamental studies of a broad materials library that includes but is not limited to: nanostructured inorganic, organic, and/or hybrid inorganic/organic composites including low dimensional materials. The combination of physical approaches and novel nanomaterials should enable properties such as high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and mechanical strength; electromagnetic properties shall also be considered. Phase I will result in design methods, modeling and simulation analyses and material trade-off considerations for achieving the objectives. Prototype material structures will be synthesized to demonstrate the desired properties and identify the potential for implementation on LRPF platforms.",Modeling and simulation will be utilized to elucidate the physics behind the novel materials’ properties which enable survivability against a range of extreme conditions including high-g and high temperature. The expected technology development work will include detailed investigations into the desired materials and their properties and performance in the desired application in the context of user requirements in conjunction with the Army; strong consideration will be given to the reliability and robustness in the context of real-world LRPF platforms. The successful phase II will deliver prototype material systems to the Army for testing in various extreme environments as well as independent characterization of the material properties.,"Phase III will entail further research and refinement of the results of Phase II with the goal of developing an all-encompassing solution for the survivability of LRPF assets against extreme environmental conditions. Throughout the effort, coordination with the stakeholders in the U.S. Army as well as in other services in order to facilitate the requirements definition and technology transition processes will be undertaken.

Current commercially available circuit simulation software is not capable of fast, accurate analysis of the response of an entire complex linear and non-linear circuit to modern time-frequency waveforms. RF circuits are currently designed based on intuition derived from the analysis of many summations of steady-state functions such as sine waves or the transient analysis of circuit response with relatively small dynamic range. RF circuits tend to be designed starting from a steady-state analytical solution, followed by extensive trial and error fabrications. Small parts of the circuit are simulated for short time intervals and the results are combined based on engineering intuition. However components of RF circuits can respond in unexpected modes when subjected to wave forms which have formulations in both time and frequency. A simple example is pulses of sinusoidal waves. The response of filters and in particular non-linear circuit elements to these time-frequency waveforms can be substantially different than would be expected from a steady state wave form analysis. Even relatively simple 5G waveforms such as OFDM and CDMA modulation can be hard to accurately analyze. More general time-frequency waveforms where the frequency content varies with time and RF transients can dominate the response may be of interest for jamming and EW or the construction of LPI waveforms. Circuit simulation tools commercially available do not have the dynamic range to address these waveforms, the number of state variables required can grow exponentially, and computation time can take weeks for a single circuit for even a limited circuit time period under analysis. These simulation tools can have dynamic ranges on the order of 80 dB, while a dynamic range above 140 dB may be required, as well as the capability to reduce the number of state variables. An appropriate simulation will also require the capability to handle true time delay and memory effects in a physically correct manner. Macro-models will be needed to address these performance and computational speed requirements. These can include accurate behavioral models and reduced-order models. Fractional calculus and complex basis functions such as wavelets may be useful in constructing these macro-models. The software should be capable of simulating the 5G waveform response in a generic smart phone front end, with center frequency in the 1 to 5 GHz range, four orders of magnitude faster than a Spice simulation. The approach should be state-variable based and capable of the accurate simulation of arbitrary state variables (including multi-physics variables), physically correct true time delay, circuit memory effects, stochastic circuit and component variation, and greater than 140 dB dynamic range. Consider leveraging various macro-model techniques, such as behavioral modeling, advanced basis functions, tensor trains, and fractional calculus. Leverage published or commercially available macro-models. The simulator should provide a “dial an accuracy” capability to allow user tradeoff between accuracy and speed.",486,3255,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate the feasibility of a software approach to linear and non-linear circuit simulation capable of simulating the detailed circuit response, sampled at any point in the circuit, to complex waveforms such as a 5G OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) or CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access), pulsed ultra-wideband, multi-carrier, frequency hopping, and non-periodic pulsed frequencies. The simulator must accurately and efficiently handle circuit non-linearity, repeated transient behavior, and full duplex operation (with simultaneous very high and very low power signals). The feasibility of the approach will be supported by a block diagram of the software routines and analysis based on performance estimation from parameters reported in the literature for the various algorithms required. Results of research in the last two decades provide optimism that such a very high performance non-linear circuit simulator can be formulated. As an example, an advanced circuit solver approach (fREEDA), from North Carolina State University, is described in ref. 1, which has a dynamic range exceeding 160 dB in transient simulation. It is publically available for download (ref. 2). It has a physically correct true time delay capability (ref. 3), can accommodate arbitrary state variables and multi-physics variables (ref. 4), and can handle distributed networks (ref. 5). Reference 11 is a link to a Sandia Laboratory generated circuit simulator (Xyce) which addresses many of the same issues as fREEDA. It is also publically available. Both have GPL public licenses. One approach to this topic would be to combine features from Xyce and fREEDA, since both can be leveraged for commercial application under their public licenses. Establish and present a transition plan for the software package, with details of specific transition partners and consideration of software documentation, maintenance and customer service.","Develop a trusted software package capable of the simulation described in phase I. Determine the fundamental limits of macro-models proposed and the measures of uncertainty introduced by each. Formulate a plan to demonstrate the capabilities of the simulation. Develop a validation plan for the simulator based on specific experiments and other limited capability simulators or simulations with extensive run time (which would not be practical for most applications). Demonstrate the simulation and validate against the criteria in the validation plan. Document the validation in a journal article for peer review which will effectively advertise and promote the simulation capabilities to the professional electronics community. Deliver a beta version of the software, including source code, to a designated government lab for testing. Provide on-site support of the government testing. Develop and deliver a comprehensive transition plan to make the software available to the government and commercial market place, with detailed outline of the roles of transition partners, an updated business model, and updated market analysis. Develop and deliver a GUI (graphical user interface) with schematic capture integrated in the simulation. The software must be implemented in a common computer language such as C++ or Python. The simulator meeting these requirements will have significant capabilities not found in commercially available software and even (to our knowledge) in dedicated software internal to industrial programs. In particular the software will be capable of comprehensively simulating relatively long time steps and time delays (milliseconds) during (for example) an EW attack, of simulating with a scalable accuracy-vs-runtime tradeoff, of accurately modeling perfectly general waveforms in two circuits coupled at major distances electromagnetically, and easily encompassing the extensive device model libraries developed for other software products.","Phase III work will advance the beta software version to a robust circuit simulator for sale to commercial and military markets. The capability to accurately and quickly simulate the propagation of advanced waveforms end-to-end and to observe the effects of individual circuit elements will significantly reduce the cost of RF chip design and therefore the electronic system itself. It is expected to be of interest to chip designers throughout the RF electronics industry, to universities and government laboratories for analysis of innovative RF circuit and waveform concepts, to agencies regulating spectrum usage, and to the electronic warfare community. The expected transition path would be for the company to establish its own software maintenance, customer support, and sales capability; to partner with an existing larger commercial software company; or to sell the license to a major software company.",1,"N.

Lightweight Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) have been demonstrated that can provide power from gaseous and liquid fuels and offer the potential to provide this power from a wide variety of fuels including complex hydrocarbons, which are generally not amenable for use with other fuel cell technologies. Currently, solid oxide systems are too large, require long start times, and have low cycle lives. This is largely driven by the requirement of operating at very high temperatures (800 -1000 °C) in conventional solid oxide fuel cells. Recent breakthroughs with triple conducing oxide perovskite and double perovskite materials such as BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ, NdBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+ δ, and PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+δ have shown significant promise at low temperatures (300-600 °C) and power densities ranging from 650 to 1100 mW/cm2. Extremely high power densities of 2 W/cm2 at 650°C have been demonstrated from a bilayer-electrolyte LT-SOFC. These remarkable breakthroughs in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell materials offer an opportunity to develop new high performance 300W LT-SOFC system that is capable of running hydrocarbon fuels, such as propane, and operating at 300-600 °C. This topic is focused on research to develop and integrate these new materials into solid oxide fuel systems to decrease weight and start up times while increasing cycle life. A lightweight (less than 3 kg) 350W+ (>150 W/kg system) low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell system is desired for a multitude of missions ranging from dismounted solider power, UAV power, to silent watch applications. This technology could be used in a variety of roles including: direct power to Army systems or to charge lithium-ion rechargeable batteries which would significantly reduce the logistical burden (weight and volume) for dismounted soldiers by reducing the number of batteries required for extended mission time as well as for a myriad of civilian electronics applications.",316,2132,1,No,No,No,,"In phase I a sub scale multicell stack using triple conductive oxide materials will be developed and evaluated using propane fuel.

1. In the description, the Phase I prototype should perform at least 2 TOPS (tera operations per second) and the Phase II accelerator should perform at least 100 TOPS. At what bit precision are these operations measured?

2. The description specifies a matrix loading speed of > 100 MHz for the Phase I prototype and > 500 MHz for the Phase II accelerator. In terms of photonic accelerators that use matrix-matrix multiplication to speed up DNNs,  the two relevant matrices are the weight matrix (e.g. the weight of a fully-connected layer or the kernel of a convolutional layer) and the data/input matrix (e.g. input images or input sentences). Do the loading speed requirements apply to both the weight matrix and the data matrix? Or, do the requirements only apply to the data matrix that can dominate the data transfer time when considering large batch sizes? 

3. The description also specifies an electrical power consumption of 0.5 W for the Phase I prototype and 10 W for the Phase II accelerator. What components are included in the electrical power? Does the electrical power consumption include the power consumed by non-photonic components (such as laser, analog control circuitry, digital memory/logic) that may be important in performing the DNN calculations?

Thank you in advance for the clarification.

Q2 (05/28/2020): For Phase I (1) it is unclear what form a prototype can take to ""demonstrate the operational principle and feasibility of the photonic accelerator.""  Can this include developing separate test structures combined with modeling and simulation to demonstrate the operational principle and feasibility or does it have to be an integrated photonic accelerator similar to what is requested in Phase II (2)?.  The short duration of Phase I (1) may impact the feasibility of fabricating and packaging an integrated module for demonstration.

These accelerators include the well-known graphical processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs). Benefiting from these hardware accelerators, new applications based on artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) that utilize artificial neural networks (ANN) have proliferated at virtually every corner in academia, industry and the society in general, despite the stagnation in raw IC processing power. In particular, deep-learning neural networks (DNN), consisting of many hidden layers, have shown the ability to generate solutions that are sometimes even superior to those based on human intelligence. For example, in 2016, the Google AlphaGo AI machines, after training for only two hours by playing with each other, beat the world’s best human player in the game of Go [16]. It is generally believed that the early success of AI in the last few years heralds a much wider array of AI solutions for both commercial and defense applications in the future. One of the examples of AI for defense applications is GPS-less navigation in the jammed battlefield, in which navigation is enabled by AI-based pattern recognition of scenes acquired in real time. The important role that electronic hardware accelerators played so far clearly indicate that future developments in ANNs depend on advances in both software and hardware. However, currently, electronic hardware accelerators have already been pushed to their limits in term of scalability. Against this backdrop, there have been renewed efforts in exploring the role of optics for computing [3-6]. Three major building blocks comprising the ANNs and DNNs are 1) Interconnects, 2) matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication, and 3) nonlinearity. Since optics and photonics can implement the first two functions as well as, if not better than, electronics; and optical nonlinearity at the per neuron level rather than the logic level is actually quite practical, now is the right time to explore the role of optics and photonics in ANNs and DNNs.

As the scaling of CMOS technology is quickly approaching its physical limit, energy scaling is becoming its bottleneck. Conversely, the advantages of operating CMOS transistors at cryogenic temperature (cryo-CMOS) have always intrigued CMOS circuit designers. A number of performance figures of merit of a CMOS process are improved when operating at low temperature without scaling down device sizes. Outstanding characteristics have been reported for advanced CMOS technologies operating at cryogenic temperature in terms of on-state current, leakage current, subthreshold swing, and transconductance. This is particularly attractive for high performance computing applications. The performance gain achieved from cooling down a CMOS integrated circuit should be judged against the cost and inconvenience of refrigeration in the context of its application. However, there are specific applications where CMOS circuits designed to operate at cryogenic temperature are advantageous. Cryogenic electronics plays an important role in sensing applications such as infrared focal plane arrays, space borne electronics, high-energy physics experiments, metrology, and astronomical detectors, and so on. Cryo-CMOS also finds its applications in the study of Quantum phenomena where low temperature is essential for minimizing thermal fluctuations. Qubits for quantum information processing typically operate at the temperature range of 10-100mK while the associated control electronics is implemented at room temperature. This approach becomes increasingly challenging and less cost-effective as the number of qubits grows. Control electronics operating at cryogenic temperatures placed right next to quantum circuits can drastically reduce interconnection complexity and noise level, and result in enhanced reliability and compactness, potentially paving the way for realizing practical quantum computers. Even though Cryo-CMOS can be traced back to the 1960s, earlier research were performed on process nodes with large feature sizes resulting limited performance in terms of power consumption and noise. Development of nanoscale CMOS process with high intrinsic frequencies (ft, fmax ~100s GHz) offers new opportunities for realizing high performance cyro-CMOS circuits. This has led to recent demonstration of circuit blocks for quantum processing controllers (an LNA using 160-nm CMOS and a microwave oscillator using 40-nm) operating at 4 K. Device characterization at 4 k for a 28-nm bulk CMOS process has also been published recently . Despite these progresses, many challenges remain for developing deep cyro-CMOS circuits. At the device level, unfavorable effects such as higher threshold voltage, hysteresis, kink effects, mismatch, and hot-carrier lifetime degradation become non-negligible at deep cryogenic temperatures, and must be considered and mitigated. Current refrigeration technologies have also limited cooling power with 1mW at below 100mK and 1W at 4K, and thus prevent the use of large-scale cryo-CMOS circuits. Finally, lack of cryogenic device characterization, physical and compact circuit models and process design kits (PDKs) for circuit design simulators must also be overcome.

In addition it is expected that the simulator would work with other DoD robotics modular software based on ROS.&nbsp;&nbsp; A simulator that was working towards this use model was called ANVEL.&nbsp; ANVEL allowed models of military vehicles to be built and simulated in various environments. The vehicles could have tracks or wheels. The simulations could work in conjunction with real-time hardware in the loop simulators with Government and collaborator autonomous driving software.&nbsp;&nbsp; The environments could be quite extensive and have obstacles such as trees and buildings.&nbsp; There were some aspects of ANVEL that did need to be upgraded.&nbsp; Although the tire contact model was adequate, it did not model deformable terrain.

However when deficiencies arose ANVEL was able to be modified as needed for Government funded research and it did provide a means for collaboration and safe testing of software for full-scale platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>",,Ground Sea,1,Ground Sea,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning | Autonomy | Quantum Sciences,Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning | Autonomy | Quantum Sciences,3,"autonomous agents, computer simulation, sensing, V2X communication, dynamics simulation, open source software, artificial intelligence",1,"autonomous agents, computer simulation, sensing, V2X communication, dynamics simulation, open source software, artificial intelligence",No,0,No,,"Establish an open source, publicly available software platform that can be used for the simulation-based development and testing of mixed teams of robots and Autonomous/Conventional wheeled/tracked vehicles operating off-road conditions.",30,"Establish an open source, publicly available software platform that can be used for the simulation-based development and testing of mixed teams of robots and Autonomous/Conventional wheeled/tracked vehicles operating off-road conditions.","Understanding through physical testing the behavior of large groups of agents operating inter-dependently in geographic and terramechanical conditions that are of relevance to the US Army is an expensive proposition that suffers from long turnaround times. Against this backdrop, the Army sees computer simulation as an avenue for accelerating the pace at which innovation permeates the broad field of autonomous operation of mixed robot-vehicle teams in off-road scenarios. The interest is in establishing a simulation platform in which scenarios that involve teams of mixed agents are analyzed expeditiously with an eye towards improving mobility/communication/navigation solutions. Thus, the simulation platform sought should address several aspects deemed critical in the economy of the practical problem of interest, e.g. agent dynamics, sensing, inter-agent communication, real time constraints, scalability, and interfacing to control strategies. Moreover, in order to ensure a lasting effect of this investment, the solution developed should be open source and available in the public domain for rapid dissemination and adoption by any interested party. The platform should simulate the dynamics of the agents and their interaction with the surrounding environment. This is particularly critical in evaluating or developing strategies used when terramechanics factors limit the capability of the vehicle (e.g., traversal of soft soils). Furthermore, the dynamics of the vehicle-ground interaction are exceedingly important and can require highly complex modeling of granular or other deformable terrain. Beyond model fidelity constraints, computational requirements must be considered such that the simulation meets real time or performance constraints determined by the task. Alongside dynamics, the simulation technology must be able to provide accurate virtual sensing as a mechanism to introduce realistic inputs to the control strategies being tested. The sensing requirements in off-road conditions for autonomous vehicles and robots are (a) sensing of the environment, e.g. camera (mono, stereo, thermal), LiDAR, radar, ultrasonic, GPS, and (b) sensing the agent’s own state, e.g. engine, driveline, suspension, brakes, IMU. This sensing simulation capability is critical as it provides the input to the control strategies used by the agent to navigate the virtual environment. While sensors provide a primary connection for the control algorithms to understand the world, these agents are also capable of inter-communication to collaborate and coordinate movements. This same capability must be provided in simulation to allow for testing connected behavior such as platooning and task coordination. Because the dynamics and sensing rely heavily on a coherent description (in both time and space) of their surroundings, management of the virtual world is a critical component of this simulation platform. The virtual world must provide an accurate representation for simulating the interaction of agents with the surrounding environment in off-road conditions. Given its correspondence to a highly rich feature set, the virtual world must include many layers including subsurface, surface, topography, vegetation, obstacles, other external agents (i.e. animals and humans), and environmental conditions. These layers must be coherent across domains such that the dynamics, camera (visible and thermal), LIDAR, radar, and ultrasonic simulations are all consistent.",491,3479,1,No,No,No,,"In Phase I, the following shall be accomplished: a) Carry out a comprehensive review of literature to produce a document detailing the state of the art vis-à-vis simulation environments for single and multiple-agent testing in both on-road and off-road conditions. b) Establish a detailed plan to handle the four aspects (dynamics, sensing, communication, virtual world) related to the simulation of single- and multiple-agent testing in scenarios relevant to off-road operations. c) Establish a detailed plan to address the modeling of the vehicle-terrain interaction at various levels of accuracy: from expeditious (empirical, data driven, etc.) to high fidelity (physics-based). d) Establish a detailed plan for an open source implementation of the simulation platform that leverages parallel computing for scalability. e) Articulate a vision for how the solution proposed, despite 3rd party software dependencies, will flourish as an open source simulation platform available for unfettered use, augmentation and distribution by other parties interested in this line of work. f) Produce an early “demonstration of technology” prototype that showcases in a preliminary form the key components of the overall solution advanced by the project.","In Phase II, the following shall be accomplished: An open source simulation platform will be developed that a) Allows the simulation of tens of robots and autonomous/conventional wheeled/tracked vehicles operating in off-road conditions. b) Allows simulation under “soft real time” as well as non-real time conditions. c) Demonstrates use in deformable soil conditions d) Possesses the interface to connect to any widely adopted control framework (e.g., ROS) and thus be able to serve as a testbed for new AI and emerging controls approaches aimed at enabling autonomy in off-road conditions typically associated with the Next Generation NATO Reference Mobility Model e) Demonstrates the ability to simulate agent-to-agent and agent-to-infrastructure communication f) Demonstrates the ability to emulate rich real-world scenarios that include, for instance, setups with deformable soils, various weather conditions, etc.","The modeling approaches, numerical techniques, performance and control models, and software development techniques established under this topic are positioned to aid in further advancement in the broad area of autonomy.

We have made significant advances and demonstrations through design, fabrication methods, and controls in each of these technologies over the past several years, but they are still lacking in terms of performance, cost, and fundamental physics-based criteria for systems that are used in human-scale dynamic limb-based locomotion and whole-body manipulation. These forms of actuation have also been seen as limiting factors in development of machine morphologies which can replicate the degrees of freedom of human motion and human performance needed for human prosthetics and exoskeletons. There are examples of efficient and dynamic limb-based mechanisms which have been achieved through means of iterative design in which the systems mechanics and morphology are expertly matched with highly customized and optimized forms of actuation and unique electronic controllers. They represent a state of the art which has yet to be accepted as suitable for machines that are expected to perform as physical teammates to Soldiers in high-OPTEMPO missions.

Some of these forms of actuation may be seen as complementary to established actuators such as electric rotary actuators and hydraulics. For example, this may include actuated structures which have adaptive compliance characteristics. New electric rotary actuator and hydraulics based concepts may be considered as well. For example, limb-based human-scale dynamic locomotion and whole-body manipulation requires high-torque with high-frequency control. New scalable actuator designs addressing these requirements may be considered.

Taking inspiration from the use of these technologies for improving the performance of professional athletes, the Department of Defense intends to optimize warfighter performance using similar techniques. The purpose of this topic is to explore technologies that will make tomorrow’s warfighter faster, smarter, and stronger than their adversaries. The human performance focus area involves all aspects of cognition and decision-making, physiology and ergonomics, and the integrating technologies required to support a fully optimized, capable soldier; acting within a given operational setting. The goal of this is the optimization of individual and team performance in combat environments using a range of solutions, scalable across all leadership levels and command echelons. Human performance emphasizes the need to expand Warfighter capabilities while mitigating Warfighter limitations as they apply in combat. To ensure mission superiority, the information about a Soldier’s mind-body state must be successfully acquired and understood within the context of the Warfighter’s cognitive capacity being stressed by fatigue, heat, altitude, interruptions, etc. This challenge is further magnified when a team or multiple teams are required to act together on the same mission. Methods and processes need to be explored that enhance peer-to-peer collaboration, shared situation awareness, and rapid decision making. In the field, warfighters are exposed to a complex set of stressors affecting their physical and cognitive abilities; often altering their physiological well-being (e.g., sleep deprivation, biological rhythm changes, heavy equipment loads, demanding physical tasks, extreme weather/environmental conditions, and inadequate/improper nutrition). The impact of many of these stressors on performance is poorly understood and their combined effects on health and combat effectiveness are virtually unknown. Furthermore, what little is known about the mitigating effects of training and self-management on physical and physiologic viability has not been rigorously applied to the challenge of enhancing Warfighter performance nor has it been demonstrated to be viable in operational or synthetic training environments. There is a need for a novel wearable monitoring solution to promote sustained performance and Warfighter health while helping to offset: 1) training related injuries during physical training across operational environments; 2) fatigue and other performance decrements in extreme environments combined with other stressors; 3) combat performance decrements related to sleep quality, sleep deprivation and sustained operations; 4) impacts of individual stress reactions during performance of operational tasks on overall warfighter health. Gap 1: Insufficient understanding of individual physiological performance markers. Gap 2: Insufficient understanding of the interaction between physical environment (stress, noise, fatigue hydration) and cognitive demands (workload, multitasking, and interruptions) on combat readiness and performance Gap 3: Inadequate automation methods to support information gathering, analysis, and processing leading to more effective and timely decisions at every command echelon.",472,3511,1,No,No,No,,"Identify the proper form factor of a multimodal biophysiological wearable solution for combat and training environments.

(1-9) have been made in ion-trap quantum systems that have significantly improved the performance of these systems. These research advances include micro-fabricated surface ion traps that have been very successful in quantum technology applications. However, surface ion traps make many design compromises such as the trap depth, ion height from the surface, among others that may not be best suited for all potential quantum technology applications. In particular, anomalous ion heating and stray charges have been a significant hurdle to advancing ion trap experiments. Three-dimensional traps provide an alternate set of design parameters enabled by geometry that may overcome some of the compromises of surface ion traps. To date, typical microfabricated three-dimensional traps have been assembled by hand. The poor precision of hand assembly has significantly limited the performance of these three-dimensional traps. Modern microfabrication techniques such as additive manufacturing, three-dimensional printing, photo-chemical structuring of fused silica, among others, permit monolithic high-precision three-dimensional ion trap geometries to be pursued. In addition, three-dimensional geometry provides the space and path for innovative laser light delivery, microwave delivery, shielding, and wiring. The design trade-space provided by three-dimensional geometry, in combination with matched high-precision microfabrication techniques and new materials, provides the opportunity to develop high-performance integrated ion-trap quantum systems, while maintaining small size and form factor. There are several technical challenges that must be addressed that integrate the versatility of the design space of three-dimensional geometry with matched materials and monolithic micro-fabrication techniques. Machine-learning techniques may help optimize the design space combined with the constraints of fabrication and materials. Further research and development is needed that holistically views ion trap design and fabrication to address these challenges. For many potential applications, holistic designs must provide a high degree of optical access covering a wide range of wavelengths that can span the near ultra-violet to the near infra-red, microwave access, electrodes and electrode wiring for ion control, high operating voltages, and be compatible with other components needed for operating a complex ion-trap system.

Additionally, as polymers, these materials possess the attractive features of being lightweight, ease of manufacturing relative to other high strength materials (e.g., metals/alloys), and inexpensive. Because of these attributes, thermally-cured thermosets currently dominate the traditional manufacturing space for thermoset materials. Highly desirable, however, is an additive manufacturing (AM) methodology amenable to processing these materials, as this would enable an “on demand”, energy-efficient means of their production. AM has also been demonstrated as a platform to rapidly fabricate customizable parts. This would be particularly impactful for DOD applications where manufacturing at the point of use may provide critical capabilities while decreasing and/or eliminating supply chain and logistical challenges. To date, the difficulty in 3D printing thermally-cured thermosets largely stems from a need for extremely rapid heating/cooling cycles (sub microsecond) that span large temperature changes – a requirement that cannot be easily met using conventional bulk heating. Recently, researchers have demonstrated novel methods of internal heating using nanoscale heat sources, such as photothermal curing (ref 1), or pulsed microwave irradiation (ref 2) that could support the rapid cure cycles required with additive manufacturing. Additionally, the aforementioned photothermal curing method has demonstrated tunable mechanical and physical properties based on the intensity of light irradiation, thus offering potential access to 3D printed parts with tailored properties (ref 3). There is an essential need to develop an additive manufacturing technique that enables the processing of purely thermally-cured thermoset polymers. The technique should also be generalizable include different types of thermally-cured thermosets. Additionally, the proposed method should not require an oven to fix the final print, and the final part should demonstrate mechanical and thermal stability akin to cast parts made from the same polymer formulation.",317,2338,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a methodology that enables only thermally-activated curing of 1 of the following thermosets: epoxy-amines, PDMS, or polyurethanes, using only commercially available components. Please note that resins that are easily polymerized via photoinitiation, such as cationic epoxies and (meth)acrylates, will not be considered. The 3D printing technique should be capable of curing at the point of extrusion, and preferably not require and oven to fix the print. If an oven is used to post-cure, the printed part should be stable for 1hr prior to oven curing. The printer should have a minimal average speed of 10mm/s throughout a print and be able to continuously print for a minimum of 20 minutes. The technique should also demonstrate the ability to stop/restart after 10 minutes with no need to clean the printer. The final print part should demonstrate a resolution (layer thickness and length) less than 1mm. 3DBenchy and other common 3D printing stress tests should be performed to ensure (i) the Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and glass transition temperature are similar to cast parts from the same polymer formulation, (ii) good adherence between layers, and (iii) solvent and light resistance similar to cast parts from the same polymer formulation. The performers should demonstrate the ability to systematically and controllably vary the thermal and mechanical properties to render parts that range from elastomeric to glassy.","Demonstrate the method developed in Phase I can be extend to use a different thermally-cured thermoset than the one the team selects in Phase I and should also extend Phase I capabilities to enable print speeds to a minimum of 50 mm/s continuously for 4 hours. Additionally, the printer should be able to change the resolution of the print (1mm to 0.1mm) and the print speed (10mm/s to 50mm/s), and also demonstrate the ability to print without user intervention. The final print parts for both classes of thermosets should demonstrate a resolution down to 0.1mm, enable printing of complex shapes, and demonstrate inclusion of specified hollow features. To validate the ability to cure and lock in the part, key structures should be printed. One such example include scaffolds and a mathematical geometric comparison of the printed geometry vs the expected geometry should be determined. Another example includes a tall structure, such as a cylinder, should be prepared to assess for slumping of the part as pressure from above layers could cause not fully cured towards the bottom of the part to flow and cause distortions and slumping of the part. Additionally, the final printed parts should demonstrate mechanical, thermal, and performance properties that exceed that of common AM resins. Solutions that also demonstrate the ability to monitor stress-development during cure, as well as the ability to co-print two different thermally-activated thermosets are highly desired.","The proposed technology has a broad range of civilian and military applications as thermoset polymers are widely used as machine parts for automotive and aerospace applications, as wound dressings for biomedical applications, as well as protective coatings. This technology could have transformative implications for DoD as it will enable the ability to print thermally-cured thermosets “on-demand” greatly simplifying the supply chain.

Tailoring of the non-covalent interactions in crosslinked ROMP polymers with polar monomers has resulted in remarkable control over polymer modulus and strength 2, while linear non-polar ROMP polymers (i.e., those that are not crosslinked like pENB) have shown remarkable toughness and high velocity impact performance 3. This impact performance, however, can be degraded by oxidative or thermally driven crosslinking due to aging 4. Linear pDCPD that is resistant to crosslinking during aging would be particularly attractive due to the low cost of DCPD monomer, low polymer density, reasonable modulus and yield strength, high glass transition temperature, and low susceptibility to water degradation. So, ideal ROMP chemistries would involve linear polymerization of pDCPD along with the ability to tailor the polymer polarity and include stabilizing additives. Currently available commercial strategies for polymerizing pDCPD result in crosslinked networks of polymers upon reaction facilitated by Grubbs catalyst or tungsten-based catalysts. These crosslinked systems have the following drawbacks: (1) they cannot be used in solvent-based processing (e.g., for composite prepreg production) due to insolubility in solvents and (2) high levels of crosslinking reduce the fracture toughness and can result in poor high velocity impact behavior. Furthermore, using monomers other than dicyclopentadiene (e.g., those that only linearly polymerize such as ethylidene norbornene) result in large increases in cost, making the materials no longer competitive with conventional structural resins. In contrast, linear poly(dicyclopentadiene) is expected to have the following decided advantages: (1) excellent high velocity impact performance and toughness, (2) potential for solution-based processing into composite prepregs and (3) the potential for polymerization of polar-group containing monomers (e.g., 5-norbornene-2-methanol) or post-processing heteroatom functionalization through secondary mechanisms. Thus, we seek the development of novel techniques or novel use of existing techniques that can be used to synthesize linear ROMP polymers, specifically pDCPD and other monomers like 5-norbornene-2-methanol that are stable and resistant to environmentally driven crosslinking. This method must be usable with solvent and without solvent (neat) to allow for the full breadth of polymer processing options. The method should also provide a long shelf life for the linear pDCPD (i.e., it should prevent ambient crosslinking of linear polymers).",384,2810,1,No,No,No,,"The offeror(s) shall develop a technique to synthesize linear polymers of dicyclopentadiene (100%) and co-polymers of other ROMP-capable monomers (e.g., 50% DCPD and 50% of another monomer) both in solvent and in the absence of solvent (i.e., neat). The offeror(s) shall demonstrate the use of the solvent-less version of the method to fabricate 6 inch by 6 inch by 0.25 inch thick plates of material.

Alternatively, the offeror(s) may develop a method of functionalizing linear pDCPD post-synthesis with the groups listed above using a scalable, cost effective method. The offeror(s) shall further demonstrate the processability of the material by solvent casting 12 inch by 12 inch sheets of linear pDCPD and other linear ROMP polymers to thicknesses of 20-500 microns. 3D printing is not desired and will not be considered.

Plume afterburning is the combustion of rich rocket exhaust with the surrounding air, leading to increased plume temperatures and enhanced thermal emission up to altitudes on the order of 30 km. Accurately modeling this phenomenon depends on knowing the engine exhaust composition and conditions, the interaction of the engine exhaust with the base area of the rocket, and the flow field surrounding the vehicle. In addition, the turbulent combustion model must be capable of accurately capturing ignition, extinction, and reignition behavior in the plume shear layer while remaining computationally tractable.","Implement the plan identified in Phase I to develop an integrated procedure to generate rocket plume flowfields that accurately capture the afterburning plume and afterburning shutdown phenomena. The metric is to include targeted experiments to confirm critical aspects of the CFD and turbulent combustion models. These models are expected to run within a reasonable time period and on a reasonable amount of computing resources. The model algorithm must be more efficient or reduce the chemistry mechanism (compared to current models) without enlarging the grid space or computational nodes. Additionally, identify approaches to incorporate the effect of particles in the plume and extract useful IR/UV/VIS/Radar signature predictions.","For military applications, this technology will be directly relevant to the identification of high-speed threats and launch early warning, including hypersonic airbreathing missiles. In the commercial and civil space arenas this capability would enable better predictions of the base heating environment of launch vehicles. The most likely customer and source of Government funding for Phase-III will be those service project offices responsible for the development of threat identification and launch early warning surveillance, however the development of highly accurate and computationally tractable turbulent combustion models can be expected to be commercially valuable for the simulation of gas turbine, diesel, and scramjet engines as well as conventional furnaces or boilers.",1,"Anon.

1.	There are a number of parameters that could be potentially optimized (general side lobe performance, P_D at given location, slant direction accuracy, slant range accuracy, interference rejection), is there an emphasis on any particular one?
2.	What is the platform/CONOPs, are there CSWAP constraints?
3.	Are there any assumptions that we are allowed to make on the antenna design and location?
A: <p class=""MsoPlainText"">1. No, there is no emphasis on any one parameter. It is up to the contractor to define the important parameters. What is important is identifying potential use cases for the quasi-orthogonal waveforms, e.g. do quasi-orthogonal waveforms give the radar an ability to better detect/locate/classify targets?

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">2. In general the Government is looking at ground based radars that will be supporting on-the-move operation for vehicle protection and/or situational awareness. Potential mission spaces are active protection system (APS) radars, mobile short range air defense radars, or ground/air surveillance radars (Ground Moving Target Indicator/Air Moving Target Indicator (GMTI/AMTI) radars), and to include bi/multi static radar systems. Antennas should be able to fit on an Army Fighting vehicle, like the Bradly, Stryker, or Abrams.

<p class=""MsoPlainText"">3. Assume you have a phased array antenna with multiple,&nbsp;independent transmit/receive sub-apertures. The level of digitization of that system is up to the contractor to decide. The Government is looking for the contractor to state their assumptions, defend their technical design, and to explain cost vs. benefit of their engineering choices.

To achieve such improvements the use of Quasi-Orthogonal Doppler waveforms is proposed. Systems utilize multiple transmitters emitting identical frequencies which include transmitter-induced Doppler frequency offsets. For example, if a pair of waveforms was transmitted with the first having the same starting phase on every pulse and the second having nπ radians of starting phase added for 1 ≤ n ≤ N pulses, where N is the number of pulses in a coherent processing interval (CPI), the waveform returns could be separated on receive by using a low-pass and a high-pass filter. As transmitted signals are finite in time thus their Doppler spectra will be infinite; however the waveforms can be separated by Doppler filtering. Hence they are considered to be quasi-orthogonal. Doppler-Division Multiple Access (DDMA) waveforms used in some Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radars are an example of quasi-orthogonal waveforms. A reciprocal bistatic radar is defined to be a radar in which the two antennas can both transmit and receive. Simultaneously transmitting a signal from the first antenna (or element of an array antenna) and receiving it on a second antenna (or array element) would have the same propagation characteristics as transmitting a waveform on the second antenna (or array element) and receiving it on the first (to within the tolerances of the transmitter and receiver hardware). The two-way antenna patterns and propagation paths are therefore identical. By transmitting a pair of quasi-orthogonal waveforms it is plausible to achieve novel range sidelobe suppression, simultaneous orthogonal polarization benefits, and other performance enhancements. For example, techniques such as Golay codes would have virtually identical sidelobe magnitude but opposite signs, causing the range sidelobes to become zero, independent of the antenna pattern, platform motion, time delay, etc. Also, polarization measurements could be made without distortions caused by the effects of pulse-to-pulse radar and target position changes. Cooperation of ground based radars using Quasi-Orthogonal Waveforms can lead to radar performance greater than the combination of single, non-cooperative radars.",347,2390,1,No,No,No,,"Develop concepts and provide analysis of one or more applications of quasi-orthogonal Doppler waveforms in reciprocal bistatic, multistatic and or multiple-channel radar applications.

Superlattice-based absorbers have enabled access to infrared wavelengths beyond those available via bulk III-V alloys while remaining strain balanced to large commercially-available substrates. The simultaneous development of unipolar barriers and the nBn architecture has largely controlled unwanted shunt currents. As a result, high uniformity, large format (greater than HD) focal planes have been demonstrated using a commercial foundry business model1. The wide design space available for band engineering with III-V material systems offers flexibility for the design of future sensor systems. Alongside higher pixel density for improved size, weight and power, future sensors will incorporate additional capabilities to achieve improved target detection at range. Detectors which can internally amplify their received photocurrent enable technologies such as range-gating for removal of obscurants/clutter or 3D imagery for computer vision or navigation. At the same time, these sensors should still be able to be used in a traditional passive imaging mode for situational awareness. A drawback to internal detector gain is that it typically introduces an additional source of noise due to the uncertainty in the stochastic amplification process. HgCdTe, the incumbent avalanche photodiode technology in the midwave infrared (MWIR), has exceptionally low excess noise due to fortuitous electronic band structure at the alloy compositions in question2. Competing III-V materials will need to be designed to prevent or limit excess noise. This could be achieved at the material level3 (e.g. through engineering of carrier ionization coefficients) or preferably at the device level (e.g. by engineering amplification to occur deterministically only at certain locations via device architecture). The level of gain delivered by the device should be controlled by the applied bias and should operate in a linear mode – Geiger mode detectors are inappropriate for this imaging application. A final consideration is that detectors should have response times suitable for frame rates which would achieve range resolution on the order of tens of centimeters4. Existing III-V commercial infrastructure, including growth foundries and focal plane array processors, will enable rapid adoption. Suitable technologies can be transitioned for insertion into future U.S. Army and other DoD systems, delivering multi-tasking sensors capable of multiple missions to the Warfighter. These sensors will enable improved target identification compared to traditional passive sensors, obscurant penetration, clutter rejection, and ranging for autonomous navigation and would directly benefit the Future Vertical Lift and Next Generation Combat Vehicle modernization priorities.

Distributed beamforming offers the potential to maximize signal-to-noise ratio at the intended recipient while minimizing the residual signal in the environment that can be observed by adversarial sensors. Some current approaches leverage an advantaged node (or base station) that can communicate to a single cluster of dismounts acting as a distributed antenna array. The Army seeks more general approaches that support distributed beamforming between multiple clusters of dismounted nodes (i.e. squad-to-squad, platoon-to-platoon) that can function without the aid of a base station.

You need a reference to measure surface deflection. Are you envisioning multiple stereo pairs (one for reference away from the wheel and another for deflection near the wheel) to be installed on the vehicle?
A: In Phase I, the goal is to demonstrate a stereo line scan camera capability that can detect changes in surface elevation within a depression such as that formed by the influence of a heavily loaded tire, but you could use a pothole or other static depression feature for your initial study.&nbsp; The third dimension (depth) is the desired response from the stereo line camera pair along with all the requirements (lighting, hardware, software, etc.) that make your system work.&nbsp; Front and rear stereo pairs and HVS mountings are not the focus of Phase I, this will be addressed in Phase II when more time and money are available for research.&nbsp; You are welcome to demonstrate as much of this in Phase I as you desire if you have the resources to do so, but as stated earlier it is not the focus.

In regards to Phase II, the Army desires two sets of stereo line scan cameras looking at the ground installed on the HVS vehicle.&nbsp; The intent is to have one pair looking just ahead of the tire capturing the bow wave occurring as the tire force approaches and one pair looking just behind the tire capturing the potential deflection basin indicating the strain the surface experiences.&nbsp; As to establishing the change in surface deflection a forward and rearward facing system could potentially capture the change in elevation during vehicle motion. &nbsp;I have not considered these logistics yet until I see proof that a line scan camera pair can work to provide real time or near real time three dimensional point clouds (Phase I).&nbsp; The task you propose is more of a Phase II concern in my opinion.

Q2 (05/26/2020): Our team has multiple questions related to the topic.  We appreciate any details that we can get regarding these questions.  Thanks in advance for your time.
1. What field of view is of interest for the program?
2. Is the total deflection the primary goal, or incremental deflection over a distance be preferred?
3.  Are there other factors that limit the application only to line-scan sensors? Could we consider other sensor systems?
4.  Any details on the light levels and weather conditions that the system is supposed to operate in?
A: <b>1. </b>An aircraft tire is typically 20-inches wide when loaded on a pavement surface. Therefore a minimum 20&rdquo; width would be desirable. If your system cannot accommodate that,10-inches is possible measuring only half the tire width as the depression basin is symmetrical. This applies to Phase 2 portion of the STTR.The mounting height of the line scan pair will be not more than about 48&quot; high having to fit near the top of a moving load carriage carrying a C-17 or C-130 tire.The carriage moves at a maximum 5 mph so it is fairly slow. It is assumed that vertical resolution should be able to capture millimeter scale changes in surface movement up to a possible 3&quot; of total deflection (rutting) if we can capture the cross sectional change in pavement over a long duration of testing.

<b>2. </b>Ideally this would collect the current state of the depth at any line scan cross-section in which the camera is collecting data. The loading carriage cycles tens of thousands of times over the life of a pavement test. It is envisioned that this camera system would be turned on at various stages of testing and run for 30-secs to a minute to collect data continuously along one or two passes of the tire along the pavement section. The deflection data can then be compared to prior data collections to observed incremental changes in depth with time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>3.</b> There have been a number of technologies applied to the evaluation of the pavement surface including photogrammetry from standard digital cameras, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and single CCD line scan laser systems currently in favor of commercial pavement evaluation firms. In this STTR, the Army is interested in the use of line scan camera pairs in a stereo format to provide real time photogrammetric reconstruction of the pavement surface at a superfine resolution (mm or sub-mm) so that small changes in surface strain can be detected during wheel movement. In the future, this camera system could also provide the same infrastructure assessment capabilities that the commercial systems offer, but at a much reduced price point.

Many of these line-scan cameras are available in the $2000-$4000 price range making them far less expensive than laser imaging systems whose systems run in the hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.This is the attractiveness of pursuing this technology as it could open up research capabilities to a far greater audience than previously available due to budget constraints.

Summary: Yes, this STTR is line-scan camera specific for cost based reasons and the pursuit of a different type of sensor solution is not of interest for this STTR.&nbsp; For Phase 1, I will allow usage of a full frame camera if you can demonstrate its operation in a line scan mode capacity to prevent purchase of new sensors for the STTR. You must be explicit in your proposal of how you propose to accomplish this sensor modification, and how you can make the full frame sensor produce data at the same frequency as a line scan camera (frames/second).

<b>4. </b>The carriage and the loading frame are housed in a large hangar so lighting is dim where data is being collected, so introduction of artificial lighting is allowed if your system requires it. The Hangar and Heavy Vehicle Simulator apparatus provide some environmental protection as there would be no rain or water, no direct sunlight and be lit during night operations. However, if your system were to be mounted on a moving vehicle to evaluate outdoor road conditions then operations would occur in daylight. Artificial lighting is allowed, but keeping costs low is preferable when considering adding new components to the system. Typical pavement line scan evaluation vans or LiDAR systems cost $750,000 to $2,000,000 or more and any price point below that (say $100,000 or less) is quite attractive to Department of Transportations or Universities.&nbsp;

In assessing the physical influence of a tire moving along a pavement surface, research has centered on the measurement of stresses beneath a static or moving wheel load, and determining an assumed deflection basin surrounding the tire-pavement contact location based on pavement model parameters [1]. To advance the knowledge of how distresses are imparted to the pavement surface from vehicle or aircraft tires at varying loads, speeds, and pressures, current imaging techniques involve either the use of light detection and ranging systems (LiDAR), or line-scan laser systems, both of which have significant cost, and are complex to operate and interpret data [2]. Of interest to the Army and the broader commercial and academic sector is the potential of introducing the technology of low-cost line-scan camera pairs to create similar data quality of the laser systems, but adopting the more approachable photogrammetry point cloud development commonly used in modern full frame image processing [3]. Line-scan cameras have a long history of use in the manufacturing and food handling industries being utilized to rapidly detect defects in metal objects, food products, or other fast moving, repetitive objects. Further, newer color based line-scan cameras work effectively at imaging long continuous objects that are otherwise cumbersome to capture with a single photograph or scan, this technology is an ideal candidate for adaptation to rail or pavement systems [4]. Line-scan cameras can produce very detailed, sub-millimeter point clouds in real time, and combining two cameras in a stereo pair can create a depth map to coincide with the real time scan [5]. It is anticipated that this approach can achieve faster and more accurate point cloud rendering of the pavement surface than traditional photogrammetry and at a comparable accuracy to that of laser based systems, all in a more deployable and price-competitive system.",339,2235,1,No,No,No,,"This research will involve demonstration of a stereo color-line-scan camera system that can measure surface deflection near a wheel load. The investigators will confirm whether smooth asphalt and concrete pavements provide sufficient point correspondences at line-scanner resolutions for photogrammetric reconstruction. Whether the introduction of red green blue (RGB) pixels in place of grey-scale pixels influences feature detection should be investigated. Further, the influence of changing lighting conditions must be quantified and addressed. This research will require development of algorithms that should provide depth data sufficient for determining deflections at every line-scan frame within a highly accurate (sub-cm) local or global reference frame. Algorithms produced from this effort should be deployable to a Windows (.NET) platform and should be written in an open-source, widely-used programming language.","Research at this phase will involve development of a deployable system that must include a stereo-pair of line-scan cameras for both the trailing and leading side of a moving wheel load. The reconstructed data from each stereo-pair should be fused for accuracy determination as well as to measure deflection differences in leading and trailing loading conditions. It is desired that the vertical and horizontal resolution of the developed line-scan camera system be tunable to match a variety of loading systems without excess data to accommodate variable tire configurations present within the military inventory. It is intended that during the Phase II effort, a demonstration of the system capability will include mounting of the stereo-pair system on the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) Heavy Vehicle Simulator (a unique testing apparatus to the military pavements community) to capture pavement distresses on a moving aircraft wheel load.","The development of a stereo line-scan camera system that is deployable either on a fixed or moving data collection system will support a number of commercial and military evaluation efforts. The military has interest in evaluation of pavement surfaces undergoing novel tire loading from newly developed vehicle prototypes to determine the impact of NGCV’s. A deployable system would also support evaluation of standard or prototype vehicles on novel pavement designs to assess real-time constitutive pavement behavior. From a commercial standpoint, Federal or State Departments of Transportation would find relevance in such an inexpensive pavement evaluation technology for assessing pavement condition for routine maintenance inspections and institutional pavement research on the national transportation infrastructure.",1,"Tarefder, R.A. and Ahmed, M.U., “Modeling of the FWD Deflection Basin to Evaluate Airport Pavements,” Intl.

Based on 3D solid microstructures with representatives volumes on the scale of centimeters and heterogeneity modeled on the scale of millimeters to 10s of micrometers, prediction of bulk electromagnetic properties is needed. The goal of this work is to develop a computational tool that utilizes 3D microstructures of geomaterials such as concrete, rock, and soil with identification of phase, chemistry, porosity, particle size, and texture distributions and predict the electromagnetic properties and response to a variety of sensing modalities. Targeted sensing modalities span a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from visible to microwave and radar. As such, prediction of material properties including electrical, magnetic, and thermal is necessary. In addition, this will require an understanding of the propagation of various energy forms into and out of the material being interrogated.",203,1429,1,No,No,No,,"Demonstrate the feasibility of integrating at least three different geomaterial types (e.g., concrete, rock, soil, or multiple or one or more types) that exhibit variations in chemistry, phase composition, and microstructure into a 3D model that predicts electromagnetic properties.

Demonstrate the use of this model to predict basic electromagnetic properties including electrical, thermal, and magnetic properties. Demonstrate the use of these properties, along with the 3D modeled microstructure, to predict the response of each material to one specific remote sensing modality such as an infrared or microwave spectrum. Deliver a report documenting the initial research activities under Phase 1 including the material analysis, simulations using the developed tool, and their initial demonstration to predict material response to various remote sensing modalities. The most effective tool will directly utilize 3D solid models of material microstructures including assigned phase structures and compositions to accurately predict electromagnetic properties. Tools that effectively predict properties when compared with physical measurements will be determined and proposed for Phase 2.","Advance the computational tool beyond initial versions developed under Phase 1 and exercise against a variety of geomaterials to predict response to a variety of remote sensing modalities.

Compare predictions of properties determined using the developed computational tool with physical measurements of these properties. Predict material response to contact and non-contact remote sensing modalities including hyperspectral, radar, etc. Then predicted responses should be validated against physical sensing systems using bench-scale experiments.

Black water and high water content wastes (e.g., food wastes) are both sources of waste that have a high potential for energy production. Instead of disposing them as wastes (at a high disposal cost), the Army proposes to develop a novel treatment/utilization method that will utilize them to produce water suitable for low tier applications in conjunction with generating energy for heating, cooling, or as stored electrical energy. The treatment/utilization system shall be able to treat mixtures of black water and high-water-content wastes with a minimum Total Suspended Solid (TSS), Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5), and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of 1450, 1170, and 2930 mg/L, respectively. The Army does not currently have the capability to treat black water or high water content wastes (e.g., food wastes) during expeditionary operations. Conventional approaches to treating or disposing these wastes are logistically intensive and increase the operational energy burden. Existing approaches to recover energy from wastewater are either large, slow, and/or require complex processes to convert products to useful energy. The goal of this topic is to spur novel integration of mechanical, electrical, chemical and biological processes to develop new technologies that maximize the performance of liquid waste treatment/utilization and energy production.

The need for U.S. forces to use more innovative ways to overcome peer and near-peer challenges to outmaneuver adversaries. This different kind of warfare has already arrived with the hybrid warfare in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, which is leading to the next fight to be with violent intensity. American power and security will be challenged by peer and near-peer actors. To be ready, U.S. forces must effectively innovate and adapt concepts for the Multi-Domain Operation to shape the fight. The U.S. military can no longer expect technology superiority in a Multi-Domain Operation and with expectation that communication and cyber systems will be compromised. In this environment, the service’s medical commands need to commence research into Virtual Health capabilities for the forward operational medics and corpsmen. These forward medical providers will be isolated, over tasked with casualties, and with limited supplies; innovative medical capabilities to support distributed operations will be a need for Prolonged Field Care in treating casualties for 24-72 hours before medical evacuation can occur.

Single-analyte biomarkers, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, have been utilized for decades as general markers of inflammation (Pearson et al 2003; Holcomb et al 2017). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of genes have been effectively connected to phenotypes; for instance Cytochrome P450 SNPs has been linked to metabolism rate of drugs (Abubakar, Bentley 2018, Deardorff et al 2018). However, while each biomarker has its diagnostic niche, most single-analyte biomarkers are associated with limited sensitivity and specificity and demonstrate efficacy only in highly focused clinical syndromes. Subtle changes in gene expression can have important biological consequences in cells (Michaels et al 2019). Multi-analyte markers to diseased state perturbations may offer the potential for greater specificity and broader applicability to a wide array of clinical settings. There are several examples of multi-analyte biomarkers that have already demonstrated diagnostic utility, including tests that measure gene expression, protein panels, metabolite panels, cytokine panels, and others. Since gene expression is rapidly altered in many cell types in response to a variety of exposures utilizing this information has several advantages. Furthermore, the widespread availability of quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) platforms in clinical laboratories allows gene expression-based diagnostics to be more easily and directly translatable to patient care. Multi-analyte assays will provide high-resolution snapshots of complex physiology and further multiplexing of these markers will be highly relevant in the field as it moves forward. Several gene expression techniques exist for quantifying gene expression (Padovan-Merhar et al 2003). Initially, low-throughput technologies were used to assess biomarkers composed of a small number of clearly defined genes. Unfortunately, qPCR can be labor intensive and time consuming and requires a large quantity of cDNA. Other possibilities include hybridization-based expression assays such as Nanostring™, Bioplex-based branched DNA assays (Qi et al 2016). The multiple steps from sample collection, RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and data acquisition provide opportunities for introduction of errors. The ability to examine a specific set of genes on a wide range of samples, using only minimal sample and reagents with a relatively short turnaround time for results with reduced man-hours per sample, makes the methods suitable for use in candidate gene validation and for use as clinical tools. The aim of this STTR is to develop a method that delivers an unbiased answer to the biological question being asked by the researcher. The following factors should be considered when choosing a method for targeted gene expression analysis: 1) development of an automated procedure; 2) investigation is on targeted region(s) of specific gene(s) of interest 3) amount and character of sample requirements. Consider clinical samples, whole blood or saliva or urine could be sample of choice. 4) Multiplexing capability. 5) sensitivity and specificity of the assay proposed 6) robustness and simplicity of the method. 7) simplicity of software for analysis and interpretation of the data; 8) Effortless use of specialized equipment and reagents; 9) Turn-around time to result 10) Assay cost.",500,3492,1,No,No,No,,"Given the short duration of Phase I, this phase should not encompass any human use testing that would require formal IRB approval.

At the end of this phase, a working prototype of the assay (s) should be completed and some demonstration of feasibility, integration, and/or operation of the prototype. In addition, descriptions of data analysis and interpretations concept and concerns should be outlined.

These protocols should be presented in multimedia format.","The ultimate goal of this topic is to develop and demonstrate a technology enabling the gene expression including SNPs and protein changes with respect to diseased state. This assay format should also be seamlessly integrated so that it can be used as monitoring tools for long term health assessment. Once developed and demonstrated, the technology can be used for identification of risk, diagnostic, prognostic, monitoring and/ or predictive biomarkers for diseased state. Development of new technique for gene/protein/SNP analysis will open a multitude of possibilities for biomarker development and might become extremely valuable in clinical practice.",1,"Thomas A.

U.S. military service members wounded in combat are susceptible to infection by MDRO at a much higher rate than civilian population due to penetrating combat wounds being accompanied by foreign body inoculum (metal fragments, rocks, dirt), large zones of bone and soft tissue disruption, nerve damage and localized ischemia (tourniquet /edema), as well as severe hemorrhage with resuscitation (often severe, >10U) of 1:1:1 – pRBCs, plasma, and platelets that will systemically disturb overall physiology [immune system dysfunction, some degree of traumatic brain injury (TBI)]. Furthermore, the current concept of war into urban dense terrain (UDT) and multi-domain operations (MDO) are expected to generate complex wounds that will require advanced prolong field care and stabilization when tactical evacuations to robust rear element medical care infrastructures are delayed. In these instances, the potential for life threating infection by MDRO is even higher and the need for solution is urgent. ESKAPEE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli) frequently colonize healthy military personnel (1) and are causative agents of persistent infections of traumatic and burn wounds that are prone to biofilm formation and multidrug resistance (2). Limited to no options in antibiotic therapy warrants the development of alternative potent antibacterials, e.g. phages. Phages are natural viruses that specifically kill bacteria to include pathogenic bacteria resistant to antibiotic treatment. Phages exhibit extraordinary specificity to target bacterial strains and can eliminate them without affecting normal microflora. A major advantage of phage therapy is the ability to exploit the constant natural evolution of phages to overcome phage resistance, infect and kill the host bacteria. Phages have demonstrated high efficacy against ESKAPEE infections in laboratory, domestic and farm animals and promising data in expanded access treatment of humans and even in recent clinical trials, especially in combination with antibiotics (3,4). Phages are becoming a very important adjunct therapy against MDR bacterial infections in civilian and military patients. When multidrug-resistant bacterial strains are identified in geographic areas of interest, it is more efficient to search for co-located phages against these strains in environmental samples from the same geographic region. Thus, natural therapeutic phages are more likely to be in the host nations of interest where highly drug resistant organisms that infect wounded soldiers deployed in military operations reside such as OEF/OIF. From Soldier Lethality and performance perspective to include staying-in-the fight, recovery and rehabilitation, the problem of infection by MDRO and ensuing sepsis or chronic infection has the solution for the infection near the site of injury. Although it is impractical to isolate phages under fire, the medical surveillance activities of pre- MDO could include surveillance of phages in area of interest so as to stage phage cocktails as adjuvant therapy. However, the ability to isolate and assess phages in remote areas away from a specialized laboratory does not yet exist.",485,3404,1,No,No,No,,"Specimens currently have to be transported over long distances to a specialized laboratory for labor intensive phage enrichment and isolation procedures that will result in the loss of phages because of non-specific adsorption to particulate matter in samples and because phages are unstable at low titers (5,6). The purpose of this STTR is to enable relatively rapid sample purification and sterilization, phage enrichment (propagation on a permissive strain of interest), screening of phages on target strains of interest, phage isolation and concentration in the field using a portable device at or near the site of specimen collection. The end product of the system sought through this process is a cocktail of phages with activity against strain of interest and system designs enabling individual phages are encouraged but not required. This capability will drastically improve force health protection at large but will more directly enable the formulation of better therapeutic phage cocktails using diverse phages with broad killing spectra isolated from remote areas around the world. The device should be easy to handle with minimal operator training. The technology should enable isolation, concentration, stabilization, and sterilization of natural phages. Users should have the freedom to select permissive and target screening strains of interest. The technology could be based on micro-filtration systems, microfluidics, centrifugation, nano-materials, gel or polymer matrix or any combination of relevant technologies. The device can be a closed or open modular portable system. The following features will be critical to consider when proposing a technology: 1) System should remove particulate matter from suspension without eliminating viable phage particles and sterilize the sample 2) System should enable users to select and input permissive strains of choice for phage propagation and target strains of choice for activity assessment 3) System should perform the enrichment (propagation) and concentration of viable phage particles 4) System should enable screening of phage activity against multiple target strains of interest 5) The field-deployable system may not exceed 30 lbs and none of its dimensions should exceed 16 inches, with minimal battery operation for 12 hrs. PHASE I should focus on the design of proof-of-concept prototype technology/device that enables removal of debris from phage source suspension, sterilization and phage enrichment (propagation) on permissive strains of choice to produce a sterile enriched viable phage mix. At the end of this phase, working prototype (s) should demonstrate particulate removal, permissive strain input access and propagation capability of the system as well as post propagation stability and sterility of the cocktail of phages. Performance (i.e. turnaround time to enriched phage cocktails) should be compared to classical manual in vitro approaches over 24, 48, and 72 hrs.","PHASE II: During this phase, the integrated system should be refined to expand on the proof-of-concept into a product that enables high-throughput screening of cocktail of phages against diverse MDRO strains of choice. Further optimization of technology should miniaturize and ruggedize the device, combine additional access and incorporate phage enrichment step with screening on target strains and stabilization. This testing should be controlled and rigorous. Testing and evaluation of the prototype to demonstrate operational effectiveness in simulated environments (i.e. extreme heat, cold, wet environment) should be demonstrated. Here, selected contractor may coordinate with WRAIR to collaborate in optimizing and validating system. This phase should also demonstrate evidence of commercial viability of the product and articulate plans to meet field-deployable requirements. Accompanying application instructions, simplified procedures, and training materials should be drafted in a multimedia format for use and integration of the product into market.","The end-state for this product is a commercially viable technology the will democratize phage harvest effort both in medical institutes, bio-pharma, educational institutes, and most importantly warfighter health protection efforts within DOD particularly the preventive medicine and medical surveillance efforts of our mission. The end product will be system ready and validated by WRAIR team for performance. Provided phages have applications beyond medical therapeutic use such as food preservation, veterinary and agricultural applications, environmental sterilization and cleaning of bacterial biofilms, etc., selected contractor should articulate plans for spin-off application and partners during this phase.",1,"Vento TJ, Cole DW, Mende K, Calvano TP, Rini EA, Tully CC, Zera WC, Guymon CH, Yu X, Cheatle KA, Akers KS, Beckius ML, Landrum ML, Murray CK.

Ground Surveillance Radar (GSR) or Battlefield Surveillance Radar (BSR) are long range sensor threats that can identify and track ground movement over kilometer scale distances, posing a threat of the maneuverability, survivability and ultimately the lethality of dismounted units. The ability to detect a GSR at a distance greater than its maximum range will turn the squad into a distributed sensor to locate advisory assets and take appropriate action. Commercial GSR systems advertise single dismount detection ranges up to 23km [1]. With smaller man portable systems able to detect 12km with traditional pulse Doppler [2] or 9km with low probability of intercept (LPI) frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) [3]. Systems are also available coupled with day/night electro-optical sensors [4]. Threat systems are line of sight and maximum ranges assume systems are placed at sufficient elevation. To contour the availability of these long-range systems the Government requires a radar early warning receiver for the individual dismounted soldier. Due to the ever-growing number of threats and potential technological capabilities for the dismounted warfighter, the Government must manage the total soldier burden of adding additional equipment to the battle kit. The Government therefore requires that this radar early warning receiver be a low profile integrated part of the uniform, armor or kit rather than an additional item mounted on the warfighter. The design should consider options such as wearable antennas and flexible electronics while considering associated challenges with these technologies for X and Ku Band (8-18 GHz) operation. The system shall intercept and identify a GSR threat at a distance greater than its maximum range for detecting a single dismounted person. The system should also be capable of finding the angle of arrival of the GSR signal and estimate the location of the emitter. Output will integrate with the Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK), a government owned mapping application, for communicating with the soldier.

The system must perform for signals in the X and Ku Bands (8-18 GHz).

(2) All test data. (3) A working breadboard prototype with software.

This water is either carried by the individual Soldier on their person in the form of the MOLLE hydration pack, canteens, and water bottles, or can be obtained from indigenous water sources in an emergency using purification tablets. Recent investment in filtration technologies by the US Army has led to the development of toxic industrial chemicals/toxic industrial materials (TICs/TIMs) filters that are compatible with the MOLLE hydration pack. However, there is no way to assess the continued efficacy of the filtration system, including when the filtration media is saturated or breached. In addition, although the filters have been developed to function for up to 135 L of water in a laboratory setting, there is no way to ensure that the filters would function as designed in an operational setting over their intended lifespan. The additional sources of fouling found in indigenous waters cannot be accounted for in the development and prototype stages. Currently, the only way to assess water quality is to obtain a sample, send it back to a centralized laboratory facility, and obtain test results in 4-6 weeks. This is an unacceptable timeframe for a Soldier needing emergency water, and puts them at risk for acute or chronic health effects if they choose to drink the water without any knowledge of the risks. Therefore, we are soliciting new ideas for a handheld sensor device that could provide assurance of water quality, after filtering, such that the Soldier could determine whether the filter is still functioning, or needs to be replaced. The sensor system shall sense for representative classes of TICs/TIMs (heavy metal, organophosphate, volatile), and salt in any source water.

Phase II deliverables would also include a final report documenting the development of the device, test results compared to the objectives and the technical data package to build the device, and a plan for commercialization.","The initial use of this technology will be to provide Army Soldiers with instantaneous analysis of the efficacy of their TICs/TIMs water purification system. This should easily transition to other branches of the Armed Forces as well. If successful, this technology will find use in a number of other sectors. The most immediate need is in underdeveloped countries where access to clean drinking water is scarce and purification is expensive. As the world’s water supply becomes more contaminated, the ability to identify whether indigenous water sources are safe, and if not, what threat needs to be addressed through purification, is a powerful tool to better ensure water quality for individuals, small groups or communities. Another area of interest is in the commercial outdoors sector, in which a small, handheld device can provide threat information from indigenous water sources for the camper, hiker, or backpacker.",1,"Technical Bulletin Medical (TB MED) 577: Sanitary Control and Surveillance of Field Water Supplies.

The knit can only be placed in strategic locations where stretch and comfort are required and durability is not a critical issue. The use of a durable stretch fabric would increase the comfort and breathability of any woven garment. An FR material that provides the strength and abrasion resistance is needed to survive the wear and tear in the field and provide FR protection. The woven fabrics currently fielded are not as comfortable against the skin as knit fabrics, are not as breathable, and do not stretch enough isotropically1 to make the conformal fitting garments necessary for heat management and reduced bulk and movement hinderance3. Knitted fabrics have very low durability compared to woven materials2. Current methods for functionalizing woven fabrics often have detrimental effects to the intrinsic properties of the fabric such as durability, and air or water vapor permeation.4 This novel fabric should have robustness, stretch and breathability to allow for the design of a more comfortable, close fitting uniform that would increase thermal and moisture management of the wearer. This novel textile should have the following properties: 1. Comfort of knit fabrics as measured in terms of bi-axial stretch, water vapor transport, wicking 2. Durability of woven fabrics as measured in terms of abrasion resistance, tear strength, bursting strength 3. The final weight and thickness of the textile should be comparable to the existing textiles used in standard duty uniforms 4. The textile should be no melt/no drip (T), flame resistance is required To develop a fabric with the durability of a woven fabric and the stretch and breathability of a knitted fabric while retaining Army requirements for flame resistance (FR) and vector protection. The improved fabric properties will enable the manufacture of comfortable fabrics, conformal garments, with good heat management, and garments for a variety of applications both military and civilian.

Currently, live soldier trainees, when represented virtually, are often seen to have position jitter, or can be seen floating or jumping to positions not physically possible in the real world. Currently, under conditions of GPS satellite signal attenuation or blockage due to terrain features is conducted by a concept called dead reckoning, which is similar to a flywheel effect, which are relative estimates of position and heading using inertial sensors: accelerometers to measure linear motion, and gyroscopes to measure angular rate change. These sensors estimate position, velocity, and heading measured from a last known trusted GPS receiver position measurement (latitude and longitude) when the satellite signal reception is attenuated, distorted, or blocked by land features such as trees or buildings. Accelerometers simultaneously detect walking steps and estimate stride length to derive an estimate for position and velocity. Gyroscopes measure angular rate changes and are used to estimate heading. The last known GPS receiver position measurement also receives timestamps from received satellite signals that are referenced and tracked by crystal oscillators for keeping time reference measurements to estimate velocity. All of these sensors have error modes that degrade Position, Velocity, and Timing (PVT) measurement estimates proportional to distance travelled and elapsed time. Current state-of-the-art dead reckoning error rate is approximately 2% of distance travelled on flat, even, terrain. We are seeking innovative dead reckoning techniques based on time series-based algorithmic solutions that exploit artificial neural networks that have PVT estimate error equal to, or less than, 0.2% of distance travelled and is able to maintain estimate performance in challenging terrain to include stairs, tunnels, and steep mountain terrain. Solutions using low cost Micro-electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) are preferred to keep cost, weight, and power consumption low. Soldier trainees often perform their exercises in the field which are often in environments where GPS satellite signals are substantially degraded or altogether unavailable, such as during maneuvers in indoor urban training center buildings.",349,2474,1,No,No,No,,Develop detailed analysis of predicted performance and perform modeling and simulation of technical approach.

However the hyperinflammatory period is often followed by a period of immune suppression. During this period of immune suppression the patient often succumbs to the effects of microorganisms that would normally be easily neutralized. There is evidence to suggest that the intensity of the hypoimmune phase can be suppressed with compounds that are already part of the human diet and have already been demonstrated to be safe. The intent of this STTR call for proposals is to demonstrate and validate that increasing the amount of specific compounds in the human diet can improve survivability after COVID-19 infection, or to demonstrate that those humans that already consumed increased amounts of specific dietary factors have an increased survival rate. The ultimate intent is to then use that data and knowledge to prescribe specific dietary interventions to improve survival in humans facing severe biological challenges, whether civilians facing challenges such as COVID-19 or soldiers on the battlefield facing a wide variety of severe challenges such as IED injuries and trauma.",194,1254,1,No,No,No,,"The investigators will obtain anonymized samples from COVID-19 patients and measure the levels of the candidate compound(s) in serum or other samples.

Data from phase I should clearly indicate that a phase II investment is justified.",In phase II the investigators will gather more samples if necessary. If the data supports human intervention trials then the investigators will obtain the necessary IRB approvals for a human trial. By the end of phase II the investigators will have either determined that 1) human mortality from challenges such as COVID-19 is reduced by dietary interventions that reduce the post hyperinflammatory period immune suppression or 2) COVID-19 survival cannot be increased by targeted altering of the human diet prior to infection.,"In phase III it is anticipated that successful phase II work will lead to recommendations to increase the intake of specific dietary compound(s) to reduce mortality from COVID-19 and other severe infections. Although levels could be increased by increasing consumption of certain foods, it is likely that a pharmaceutical would also be created, tested and marketed as protection against COVID-19.",1,"Bortolotti P, Faure E, Kipnis E.

One of the methods to increase overall performance of a propulsion system is the use of high energy thermoplastic elastomers (ETPEs). These materials are formed by linking two or more polymeric building blocks, one of which is typically crystalline in nature and one of which is amorphous, into a single polymer chain. The specific properties of a given ETPEs is controlled by a number of factors including characteristics of the building block molecules and linking agents, average polymer molecular weight, and distribution of molecular weights. ETPEs have been shown to have promising key properties such as good flame temperature, stability and performance. BAMO-AMMO, one of the ETPE material, an energetic block copolymer, offers desirable performance, good mechanical properties, high energy, is clean burning, and is chemically compatible with a wide range of materials such as nitramines. Significant efforts have been performed in developing BAMO-AMMO such as tailoring the ""soft"" AMMO and ""hard"" BAMO blocks of the copolymer to tailor the final mechanical properties. However, the current manufacturing processes for BAMO-AMMO prevent the ETPE from being affordable or manufactured with high throughput. The polymerization reactions need excessive amounts of reaction time (up to 96 hours) and extensive workup and isolation. The focus of this SBIR project shall include multidisciplinary research and development effort focusing on a robust, scalable and affordable manufacturing process for BAMO-AMMO and its precursors using modern technologies.",261,1771,1,No,No,No,,"Develop and demonstrate lab-scale synthesis method (~25-50gms per batch) using novel processing concepts to produce BAMO-AMMO material.

While inputs are known and outputs are well characterized, the process itself is not well monitored. This results in tremendous deficiencies, and overall a lower quality product for the Warfighter. This also contributes to the difficulties associated with transitioning new technologies to the Warfighter, as implementation is inhibited by an ignorance of how new materials behave when used with current manufacturing techniques. An additional difficulty is that many parameters critical for understanding and assessing them are difficult to measure, especially across a wide of variety of environmental conditions. This impedes maturation of new materials, as costly, time consuming testing becomes required at every developmental stage. This is especially relevant now, as the potential of some of the most advanced models is impeded by a lack of materials characterization. Succinctly, the development of new materials at nearly every technology and manufacturing readiness level is negatively impacted by a lack of high throughput characterization.By measuring a suite of critical properties efficiently across a wide number of environments, these issues can be solved. At first, this would provide a boon to lab scale efforts, as they would allow a much broader number of materials to be examined and down-selected far more quickly than currently possible. This would make implementation of pilot scale-up to low-rate-production much easier by providing a far more comprehensive understanding of the materials in question. Furthermore, the technology can be implemented at these stages to function at first as a method of easing transition of novel materials, but later on as method of optimizing efficiency and functioning as seamless quality control. While not a requirement, it would be preferred if the developed probes operated under 'first principles' and therefore required little calibration to use with new materials. This would ensure that they have the broadest impact in the quickest manner, while minimizing cost. These technologies are expected to have dramatic impact across a variety of industries. For example, pharmaceutical companies could use probes under the developed effort to speed the transition of new drugs. Ceramics and metals, especially those using nanomaterials, would also benefit. The plastics industry could use these types of online tools to replace much of the characterization they do offline.

The General User Interface (GUI) should be relatively straightforward and systems should be provided to the US Army for further testing and verification. These probes should be certified as explosion-proof, and shown to be resistant to environments with a pH of 4 to a pH 11. A user manual should be drafted.","Based on feedback from Phase 2, improvements will be made to the system to enable transition to industry partner/production facilities. This includes further improvements of user interface. Furthermore, demonstration of long-term stability of the system should be undertaken. This would include long-range studies which will measure the accuracy of the probes over long periods of time, and the demonstration of reliable usage over the course of a year.

This has necessitated the development of polymers which can match the rigors associated with state of the art systems. Chiefly, they must maintain great strength and stiffness while under high thermal loads. In order to be processable, however, they must maintain high solubility levels in commonly used solvents so they can still be worked into desired shapes. For example, for many applications they must be able to be cast into thin films. Furthermore, if they can be easily processed, they could then be used in novel energetic formulations as binders. Here, they could impart great stability to energetic formulations, a critical goal in many novel munition systems which will put tremendous thermal load on energetic formulations.Unfortunately, while not mutually exclusive properties, it appears as if many polymers with high glass transition temperatures exhibit poor solubilities. To further the difficulty of the problem, it appears, few, if any polymers currently available have a high enough glass transition temperature to satisfy the needs for the US Army. Therefore, new polymers are required with high glass transition temperatures, but these polymers must also be easily molded into desired shapes, which means they must have high solubility in commonly used organic solvents. They should also exhibit superior mechanical properties through a wide temperature range, as envisioned applications will required relatively high stresses, and often, very high strain rates.These polymers must be manufactured in an environmentally friendly manner, and should be sourced domestically. When possible, issues with foreign/sole sourcing of precursor materials must be addressed. If successful, it is expected this effort would spawn off numerous other programs, for example MANTECHs, and this effort should produce sufficient information to pursue follow on efforts.While interesting in other cases, this effort should NOT focus on use of additives such as nanoclays, carbon nanomaterials etc. The goal of this effort is to obtain the desired properties purely with the polymer.

The polymers should exhibit significant solubility in at least one organic solvent, preferably two or more, and they should be insoluble in water. Important thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature, crystallization temperature, and bulk modulus across a wide temperature range should be reported. The chemistry of the polymer should be mostly optimized at this point.","Polymers will be produced in the 100s of gram scale. Here the production of the polymers will be optimized, and any issues with the supply chain must be addressed (such as sourcing precursor materials from foreign and/or sole sources). Pricing of the polymers will be estimated under the assumption of an annual buy of ~100 Kg. The polymer properties should be optimized at this phase for the most likely applications, to be further explored in phase 3. Molecular weight is a key consideration in this phase. Aging studies should be conducted at this stage, to determine the suitability for long term usage. High strain testing of the properties of these materials should be conducted, but the US Army will be able to provide such characterization at this stage if required. The polymers should now be ready for use in engineering type tests, where they should be provided to the US DoD in the desired configuration. The US DoD will require 500 grams of each polymer for further evaluation in this phase.","Kilogram scale quantities of the 1-3 downselected polymers will be produced to support identified applications of interest. The polymers must be processed into a form usable for the US government. The polymers must be delivered to a US DoD installation, or a US DoD funded contractor before the end of project for a full scale evaluation. At this point, engineering tests should be performed on the polymers in the desired system, and if issues arise, further customization might be required.High Tg polymers also offer a number of advantages in numerous industries, with the most dramatic example being those in space. This is because high Tg polymers are generally speaking offer extremely good strength to weight ratios, while maintaining properties across a wide temperature range. They are even useful for 'exotic' propulsion such as those using solar sails.

The HPCR IC engines and their components are designed for diesel fuels, however, they are typically operated with F-24 jet fuel by the US Army and other DoD branches. The properties of F-24 that are important to HPCR IC engine operation vary widely, such that some fuels that meet F-24/JP-8 specifications[1,2] may cause premature failure of HPCR fuel delivery components. Further, tactical independence of US Army units requires ability to operate outside of the established supply chains that provide fuel within established specifications. The broadening of the allowable fuel-property envelopewill increase the ability of fast-moving, forward operating units to use the fuel resources that are immediately available in their environment. HPCR fuel pumps are sensitive to the lubricity of the fuels that they are pumping and are liable to fail prematurely when fuel lubricity falls below those of diesel andadditivized jet fuel.[3,4] Fuel lubricity is based on chemical and rheological properties (viscosity) and can vary widely between diesel, jet fuel, synthetics, ethanol, and gasoline. Current high-pressure fuel pumps typically use cylinder-piston and cam designs that undergo sliding, reciprocating, and/or intermittent contact motions with significant loads at the points where various components come into physical contact. The vulnerabilities of these pumps is largely due to inadequate lubrication at those sliding and impacting mechanical interfaces combined with the tight tolerances that are needed to reach the desired fuel pressures. Innovative concepts and methods are sought to reliably pressurize low-lubricity fuels to high pressures of at least 2,500 bar while providing adequate flow. The resulting pump design is expected to increase robustness and reduce vulnerability to varying fuel properties by avoiding materials failures from inadequate lubrication of sliding and impacting mechanical interfaces by the working fluid. The target for the pump design are HPCR IC engines from commercial engine manufacturers usedin class III unmanned aviation systems (UAS) and small-to-medium manned and unmanned ground systems (20 to 350 horsepower) for operation on standard military fuels (F-24, JP-8) and lower lubricity fuels (synthetic, ethanol blend, etc.).",361,2491,1,No,No,No,,"Formulate details of proposed pumping method that eliminates vulnerability to low lubricity fuels through novel designs, materials, and operational concepts that eliminate sliding and impacting interfaces, or reduce their severity (sliding speed and distance, contact pressure, etc.) and number significantly. Proposed methods to produce the required pressure and fluid flow rate may use a single stage or multiple stages, however, any method and surrounding design must significantly reduce the number and harshness of mechanical interfaces from current HPCR pump designs. Possible methods of producing pressurization and flow are centrifugal motion, magnetic fields, solid-state compression, and microfluidics, but solutions are not limited to these methods. Develop design of major pump components and concept of how they work together to achieve compression and flow while minimizing sliding mechanical interfaces. Demonstrate feasibility of pumping method(s) to meet the required pressure and flow metrics in Phase II in a conceptual pump design through a comparison of instrumented benchtop experiments and analytical and/or numerical modeling/simulation.

A: For the purposes of meeting the weight requirement, &quot;airframe&quot; would refer to anything that is airborne.&nbsp; Delivered &quot;airframes&quot; might not include all of these components, or those components may not be in their final form.&nbsp; In this case, the delivered airframe might be a bit more or less than what the final planned vehicle would be once final components are inserted.&nbsp; In this case, a projected weight budget showing that the final tactical vehicle will meet the 150 g limit should be included.

Q2 (08/27/2021): Would refinements to an existing commercial/academic UAV development platform be acceptable for Phase I and II of the Topic proposal?
A: Leveraging existing technology, components, hardware, etc., is acceptable.&nbsp; It is expected that the resulting product would be more mature and/or more capable as a result.",,Electronics,1,Electronics,Control and Communications,Control and Communications,1,"UAS, UAV, drone, squad, soldier lethality, situational awareness (SA), situational understanding (SU)",1,"UAS, UAV, drone, squad, soldier lethality, situational awareness (SA), situational understanding (SU)",Yes,1,Yes,,Develop an unmanned aerial system (UAS) airframe (< 150 g) with extremely low SWAP-C to support squad-level situational awareness.

Tactical ground control station and payload development are outside of scope.,"The Army is currently attempting to field personal UASs for organic squad-level situational awareness and understanding (SA/SU). However, in the sub-150 g space, there are few if any options which meet all of the needs of the Soldier, and carry a substantial cost. Clearly, there is need for disruptive innovation to fold additional capabilities into a lower SWAP-C airframe. An airframe below 150 g is an Army Key System Attribute threshold, with an objective of 25 g. The airframe must have a payload capacity of ? 5 g, although payload development is outside of the scope of this effort (minimally, a ""dummy"" payload should be used). Visual and audible signature must be extremely low: it is an Army Key Performance Parameter that the audible signature not exceed 40 dB at 30 m. The UAS must have a flight time of 20-40 minutes. The UAS shall be capable of flight in sustained 15 knot winds and survive gusts of 20-30 knots.While development of an appropriate radio may fall outside of the scope of this effort, the airframe should minimally incorporate a COTS radio for demonstration purposes. In this case, it shall be capable of later integrating a radio with 900-1500 m line of sight and 300-600 m non-line of sight (-30 dB) range, encryption, and live video feed. That is, the airframe shall possess appropriate SWAP allowances on the system level to incorporate such a radio.Desirable features include threat detection and cueing; cursor on target; GPS and GPS denied operations; ability to integrate with ATAK/Nett Warrior (Android Tactical Assault Kit) and Adaptive Squad Architecture; obstacle avoidance; and GPS-denied return to home. Many or all of these features are likely beyond scope of this effort, but the airframe shall include appropriate hardware (e.g. processors, memory) to allow feature implementation without hardware change to the UAS. Maintenance shall be performed by the user and without special tools whenever possible. Operating temperatures are ? 0-20&deg;C and ? 40-50&deg;C and storage temperatures are (-30)-55&deg;C. Ease of use and high mean time between essential function failure and system abort are important. Ultimate manufacturability of the UAS and materials/component selection are an important consideration during this development effort for keeping final unit costs low.",367,2320,1,No,No,No,,"Develop an initial concept design to meet the requirements above.

Deliver draft CAD or other designs/models for your concept, and discuss technical and commercial feasibility.","Refine the design from Phase I using a detailed analysis of system trades and input from appropriate stakeholders. Fabricate, test, and deliver at least one prototype airframe meeting the above requirements, along with any supporting hardware (e.g. ground control station) and user manuals. Deliver a detailed plan to integrate any desired features into future designs which could not be included into the Phase II delivery prototype.","As appropriate, partner with relevant suppliers and/or prime contractors. Further develop the UAS and relevant sub-components to meet all of the desired specifications, and integrate the UAS into a low SWAP-C tactical kit with everything required to operate the UAS (e.g. ground control station, spare components, display, etc.). Develop firmware and interfaces required to meet sensor interoperability protocols for integration. Determine best system integration path as a capability upgrade for a relevant Army Program of Record.The desired end state is a UAS providing SA/SU to the Squad or first responder with low/no cognitive burden and user input. That is, the Soldier should not be taken out of the fight (head up, hand on weapon), and the system should be fully integrated with the rest of his kit and network. Squad-level SA could then be propagated through to higher echelons as desired. This allows the individual Squad to know what is around the next corner or over the next hill, assist with building and route clearance, and provide life-saving real-time local intelligence.Commercially, this technology has many applications for first responders. Police agencies can make use of it in many of the same ways as would the DoD. It would also be useful for search and rescue, especially in areas where it is difficult or dangerous for first responders to reach. A thermal payload, for example, would allow fire fighters to assess buildings and rooms before entry, and allow for much easier location of people via their thermal signature. Fitted with appropriate payloads, it could also discover chemical, biological, nuclear, or other threats, such as near a chemical spill or reactor meltdown.",1,"SBIR.gov.

PNT systems of the future will be expected to utilize an array of PNT sensor inputs in order to provide an assured-PNT solution that is resilient from adversarial threats, interference, and other challenging environments. A layered approach having multiple PNT sensors including those rooted in traditional RF signals from space and terrestrial systems alongside emerging complementary PNT sensors is viewed as having greater potential for providing a military PNT solution at a level of assurance and integrity that is not currently found with GPS (reference 1). Beside a military GPS receiver and MEMS IMU, for example, a combat vehicle in the future may be equipped with additional PNT technologies such as Multi-GNSS, RF Ranging, EW sensors, Vision Aided Navigation, SOoP, AltNAV, Celestial Navigation, etc. An identified challenge of a layered sensor fusion approach in future PNT systems is the ability to manage and assess large amounts of sensor data in real-time to determine how the PNT system can optimally configured while experiencing complex and emerging threat scenarios. Another significant problem for the multi sensor solution is the limitation of military platforms to be able to equip a large amount sensors with minimal impacts performance of existing systems/subsystems as well as constrains for SWaP_C. For example, a future vehicle PNT systems will comply with the C5ISR/EW Modular Open Suite of Standard (CMOSS) and PNT sensors will be made in card form factor for a common chassis. Under the OpenVPX configuration, however, there will be limited slots for PNT sensors. Some of the PNT sensors in future will be hardware agnostic or have similar hardware designs that can be retasked with a different software load. Many sensors and systems will have intelligent deep-learning architectures requiring inherent configuration flexibility and advanced processing schemes (reference 2). Thus Reconfigurable PNT Sensors will be highly valuable along with a better choice of sensor fusion algorithm to optimize platform SWaP_C as opposed to deploying all PNT sensors concurrently which may not always be needed for a given mission (reference 3). The US Army is requiring future PNT systems to comply with MOSA where all PNT sensors will be designed modularly and work as truly plug and play sensors for the purpose of increasing interoperability and reducing costs, including those of future enhancements, and capturing the largest amount of industry innovation. Such a system would benefit from an optimization algorithm having Reconfigurable PNT Sensors enabled by software defined receiver (SDR) technology or other advanced signal processing methodologies that can efficiently and effectively provide real-time signal monitoring, analysis, and then reassign PNT sensors/resources to counter the detected threat with optimized configuration for the PNT system.",457,3010,1,No,No,No,,"Using modeling, simulation, and experiment to determine the technical feasibility of the design goals described above and provide a specifications for the potential product in the end of this phase.

Obtaining the bandwidth necessary for the high data rates demanded by modern applications is extremely expensive within licensed bands, and permissible use of the unlicensed bands entails various design restrictions. Free space optics (FSO) systems that can communicate using lasers eliminate these problems since the optical bands are unregulated, and the extreme directivity of lasers prevent interference with nearby receivers. Furthermore, the large amounts of available bandwidth with this approach can offer very high data rates.Unfortunately, while current commercially available FSO systems are suitable for fixed-site point-to-point applications with mast/tower-mounting, they are unsuitable for highly mobile applications with stringent size, weight, and power (SWAP) requirements. Additionally, the high-cost of FSO makes it impractical to field in very large quantities for military use and rules out potential civilian applications. Photonic integrated circuit (PIC) based FSO address all of these problems. Designed to be fabricated on an integrated circuit, PIC-based FSO can achieve size and weight reductions of multiple orders of magnitude relative to traditional FSO designs, and, when fabricated in production quantities, the costs of these PICs are minimal compared to FSO system component costs. In addition, because optoelectronic techniques enabling extremely rapid beam-steering can be used instead of mechanical steering, chip-scale systems can support on-the-move applications. Because of these capabilities and attributes the use of chip-scale FSO holds great promise for incorporation into networks as a means to alleviate the growing demand for RF spectrum while providing high data rate communications in a low SWAP-C design.Although chip-scale FSO components have been fabricated and demonstrated at various levels of maturity, additional development of the components and receiver design is needed in order to realize the promise of the technology. Current designs are limited in field-of-view (FOV) especially across wide bandwidths and implementation of high-speed pointing and tracking (PAT) is limited. C5ISR Center seeks the design and development of a chip-scale optical receiver that overcomes these challenges and enables low SWAP-C high data rate communications for highly mobile applications. In particular, C5ISR Center seeks a wide FOV (>= 45 degrees) wide-bandwidth (1 - 10 GHz) receiver capable of pointing and tracking and high rates (<= 500 us slew time across FoV). This includes significant increases in field of view in both azimuth and elevation planes across high bandwidths (e.g. 1 - 10 GHz or higher) as well as the ability to support high-speed beam-tracking, node acquisition/network entry, and angle of arrival calculations.Work under this SBIR aligns with Army network S&T investments, including the Nova Specter project.",435,3044,1,No,No,No,,"During Phase I the selected company(s) will design a chip-scale optical receiver capable of beam-tracking for highly mobile applications (e.g. vehicles, drones).

A pointing and tracking (PAT) mechanism will be designed with high slew rates (<= 500 us across FoV) that maintains low probability of detection and does not incorporate a side-channel or locator beacon. For eye-safety, designs must operate between 1200 nm - 1700 nm. A report documenting the design will be delivered to the government at the end of Phase I.","The Phase II effort will fabricate the chip-scale optical receiver and incorporate it into a demonstration/prototype communications system capable of demonstrating the ability to beam-track while sending high data rate communications (>1 Gbps). The optical receiver and demonstration/prototype communication system shall be delivered to the government at the conclusion of the Phase II effort along with a user's guide and an interface control document documenting the physical, electronic, and signaling interfaces necessary to incorporate the optical receiver into a third party design.","The Phase III effort will focus on commercialization of the technology, which could include civilian applications such as wireless access networks or drone communications. This will entail maturing and optimizing the chip-scale receiver from performance, cost, and ruggedization standpoints. This will also necessitate an innovative packaging design that incorporates a protective layer(s)/housing to prevent damage to the optical components and minimize the impact/likelihood of dirt, debris, condensation, water, or other obfuscating substances as well as scratches, cracks, or other damage to the protective covering.The Phase III system will produce a compact optical receiver with impactful capability for both Army/DoD and civilian applications. For the Army/DoD FSO based communications will enable significant advancement in network capacity and improvements in low probability of detection (LPD). This can be used for air-to-air, air-to-ground, as well as ground-to-ground applications such as inter-vehicular communications. The lack of spectrum approval required for the use of FSO will represent an enormous time savings for spectrum managers, and the ability to use optical spectrum for a much wider range of communications will enable RF spectrum to be conserved for where it is most needed (e.g. non-line-of-sight links). In the civilian sector chip-scale optical communications holds tremendous opportunities. Billions of dollars are spent by commercial companies to secure the use of RF spectrum. The ability to use the optical spectrum instead which entails no spectrum costs, can therefore save enormous amounts of money. In addition to communications, certain optical receiver designs can also be applied towards LiDAR, which is a key component in some approaches to autonomous vehicle technology.",1,"P. F.
