A: <ol>
	<li>MFA is mostly utilized for people authentication not so much IoT or device authentication</li>
	<li>not sure i understand DAR in relation to this Topic. this Topic was written from an Identity, Credential &amp; Access Management (ICAM) Lens. essentially, how do we eliminate an anonymity on a network by leveraging ICAM to implement Network Access Control?</li>
	<li>What does the acronym ESG stand for? please review the NIST references listed WRT to IoT. NIST also has guidelines for a ZTA implementation.&nbsp;</li>

Operation in open and closed military environments, and commercially enabled environments requires maximization of bandwidth efficiency to meet new challenges. The US Army, in conjunction with the Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program, is interested in acquiring a communications hub controller for broadening tactical radio capabilities within the current MUOS satellite constellation. In addition to this capability, the interests are furthered in respect to follow-on MUOS satellite builds. In operating parallel to the existing MUOS communications hub controller, a new communications hub controller must be developed under this effort to perform signal processing to access, host and power correct Radio Frequency (RF) signals as needed for non MUOS waveforms. As with most network hub receivers, multiple remotes must be handled by a network controller. All remote terminals using Division Multiple Access (DMA) are associated with at least four different time windows. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) time windows must include guard time, transmission connect time, transmit duration time, and termination time. In a Code DMA (CMDA) the time windows are not as paramount, but still require innovative design to provide this capability, while not interfering with the current MUOS communications hub controller. It is crucial that each remote user, upon access of the communications hub controller, is de-conflicted with the MUOS network. The de-confliction will only be required when the MUOS waveform is present. The communications hub controller will interface to the existing architecture via RF at the frequency range of L-band. The data will interface with a secure network that requires standard Ethernet data interface packets. The requirement of this effort is to design and build a scalable communications hub controller to handle multiple Multi Product UHF L-band System Extension (MPULSE) Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) waveform radio accesses that are deploying Direct Sequence Spread Spreading (DSSS) for broad use.

These standards allow multiple vendors to provide payload modules for C5ISR systems without the need to build to proprietary interfaces or replace entire systems.

The portable sampler will efficiently ionize atmospheric threats that are biological and chemical in nature.,"It is vital to continue the development of a small compact mass spectrometer equipped with an ion source which could be employed for use in chemical and biological defense (CBD) for the direct analysis of vapor and aerosols in near real time. The main goal is to develop an 'air-breathing' ionization source for an existing and ideally commercially available portable instrument. Portable instruments should be compact (<2.5ft3), under <60 lbs, and able to run on batteries and/or 120V AC. The current state of the art largely involves the use of some form of pre-concentration, akin to sorbent tubes, which is then desorbed by flash heating or using a solvent system thereby introducing the sample into the mass spectrometer for analysis and identification. Although pre-concentration strategies are not excluded from this topic, proposers should keep in mind that analysis should be as close to near real-time as possible (e.g. <10 secs). There are a large number of ionization strategies that could be utilized with an 'air-breathing' source; however, proposed efforts should be beyond a basic research effort. Designs that require frequent human intervention are not desired. The goal of this work is to detect volatile organic chemistry (VOCs) that could be linked to the production of harmful threat material such as toxic industrial chemicals (TICS), energetics, chemical warfare agents (CWAs), and pharmaceutical-based agents (PBAs). Careful consideration should be taken to ensure that confounding chemistry (<75Da) does not significant interfere with the analysis process. Tackling this hurdle requires addressing limitations with both the mass analyzer and the ionization technique. These strategies should be clearly addressed in the proposal.Proposals which can also be used for biodetection (bacteria, virus or toxin) or address how the system may be modified for these applications are highly desirable.",291,1918,1,No,No,No,,"Conduct feasibility studies of different proposed approaches including modelling, simulation, and calculation of collection and ionization components.

A: Depending on user needs, the solution will need to be able to conduct simulations of varying complexity (i.e. scenarios range from simulating just one attack on one device/subcomponent model to simulating multiple attacks on multiple models simultaneously, representative of a whole vehicle platform). As such, the solution should be capable of the highest fidelity necessary when simulating attacks against a single component. Transistor-level modeling and modeling of electrical components may be necessary to adequately simulate unintended RF or power emissions, enabling side-channel analysis attacks to be simulated, so the solution&rsquo;s environment must support this level of fidelity. Of course, due to the fact that this level of fidelity will be resource intensive (especially when simulating an entire platform of systems simultaneously) and that an end-user&rsquo;s computer will be resource limited, the solution will need to be capable of conducting simulations at lower levels of fidelity as well (based on end-user settings).",,"Electronics, Ground Sea, Information Systems, Sensors",4,Electronics,Cybersecurity,Cybersecurity,1,"HARDWARE IN THE LOOP, BUS NETWORKS, GROUND VEHICLES, CYBERATTACKS, CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, CYBERSECURITY, VULNERABILITY SCANNERS, COMPUTER SIMULATIONS, ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, ELECTRONICS",1,"HARDWARE IN THE LOOP, BUS NETWORKS, GROUND VEHICLES, CYBERATTACKS, CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS, CYBERSECURITY, VULNERABILITY SCANNERS, COMPUTER SIMULATIONS, ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, ELECTRONICS",No,0,No,,"Develop physics-based modeling and simulation of vehicle components and electronics, including virtual emulation of controllers and other devices, for conducting cybersecurity assessments and vulnerability research.",25,"Develop physics-based modeling and simulation of vehicle components and electronics, including virtual emulation of controllers and other devices, for conducting cybersecurity assessments and vulnerability research.","In order to mitigate the risk of cybersecurity incidents and their likelihood of occurring it is important to continually perform cybersecurity assessments and vulnerability research on Army vehicles. One objective in performing these kinds of cybersecurity evaluations is searching for vulnerabilities in both hardware and software, as they can significantly impact a vehicle system's cyber resiliency (i.e. the ability to withstand a cyber-attack and recover). However, the tools, techniques, and technologies currently utilized in performing these tasks are insufficient and generate substantial risks, costs, and schedule impacts. Many of the issues related to these testing methods can be attributed to their reliance on physical hardware. Accordingly, a solution that develops vehicle cybersecurity simulation technologies will reduce many of the hardware dependencies seen in evaluating a vehicle system during all phases of its lifecycle. Advanced cybersecurity simulators will also have the added benefit of reducing barriers to entry such as high starting costs and the degree of expertise needed for conducting evaluations.To currently minimize hardware dependency, cybersecurity researchers and engineers are able to evaluate systems by utilizing Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) simulators before performing evaluations on physical vehicles. These simulators are capable of emulating hardware and software components, but have their own drawbacks that can diminish their effectiveness in minimizing hardware dependency. For instance, SIL simulators are designed to run code on simulated hardware representations, based on high-level hardware functions. As such, they are ineffective in simulating hardware and may not provide completely accurate results in software simulations. HIL simulators on the other hand validate the performance and functionality of controllers and other electronic devices, but don't provide many capabilities in performing cybersecurity evaluations. Although HIL simulators emulate simple electronics such as sensors and actuators, they generally do not emulate more complex ones and instead require a physical component to interface with. These drawbacks require extensive evaluations to be performed on physical hardware instead.Many evaluations can be performed in a lab environment using a hardware workstation. This workstation is typically referred to as a test bench setup and incorporates all of the connectors, controllers, and other electronic devices from a vehicle platform. Evidently, this method also has drawbacks with cost and schedule burdens. Firstly, setups lack flexibility, requiring that each platform variant or vehicle model have its own uniquely tailored test bench. Their cumbersome size and lack of portability alone creates logistical burdens in acquiring, transporting, and storing existing setups. All of these issues are reflected in cost and schedule impacts and can multiply for each piece of hardware if there's a need to build a setup from the ground up.To address the capability gaps in performing cybersecurity assessments and vulnerability research, advanced simulation technologies would primarily need to be able to: emulate any and all kinds of controllers or other electronic devices with physics-based modeling and simulation, even down at the component level (e.g. transistors, resistors, capacitors, etc.), and conduct cybersecurity testing for exploits and vulnerabilities to provide additional utility to cybersecurity researchers and engineers. Notably, simulation tools and illustrative visuals can enable non-cybersecurity professionals to better understand cyber resiliency and critical vulnerabilities throughout a component's lifecycle, promoting more secure and safer vehicles for both the automotive industry and the Army.",532,3842,1,No,No,No,,"Determine technical feasibility for a software-based solution to simultaneously emulate many vehicle ECUs and other electronics devices of varying complexity (e.g. number of transistors, I/Os, and registers, size of memory, dimensions, etc.). Additionally, the solution should outline the capability of emulating software and firmware for these virtualized controllers and devices. Hardware will be virtualized using physics-based modeling and simulation in order to enable the capability of testing for cyber-attacks that utilize the electromagnetic spectrum and other electrical properties, likely drawing on concepts from electromagnetic simulation technology. Inherently, functionality testing evaluates that a system does what it should while cybersecurity testing evaluates that a system does not do more than it should. This is an important consideration for minimizing the attack surfaces of vehicle systems. As such, the solution should also have the inherent capability of testing for known and unknown functionalities in simulated systems.Design a concept for the solution with open architecture or open-source principles in mind. This flexibility will enable 3rd-party developed systems and components to be seamlessly integrated into the simulator to facilitate and improve various cybersecurity evaluations. Possible use cases include: cybersecurity researchers and engineers uploading tools and reproducible cyber-attacks for conducting cybersecurity assessments and vulnerability research, and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) uploading their own proprietary controllers and devices in order to conduct cybersecurity evaluations throughout the product development lifecycle. The solution will also outline a common test architecture for integrating known attack scenarios, exploits, and vulnerability scans into the simulator. A common test architecture will improve turnaround times when evaluating system cyber-resiliency against newly discovered vulnerabilities and exploits.","Develop the solution to achieve the capabilities outlined in Phase I. Demonstrate that the solution meets the first major milestone of emulating a target ECU, such as a MIL-PRF-32565 Li-ion 6T Battery Management System, and validate the performance against a HIL simulator using the physical ECU. Demonstrate that the solution meets the second major milestone of simulating all hardware-based and software-based systems for a target military platform, such as the Stryker or Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).Develop a default library of prevalent hacks, exploits, and cyber-attacks for the simulator. Due to some attacks occurring over a long period of time, the solution must also be capable of simulating systems at different points in time. Many different kinds of cybersecurity evaluations can be performed during a session simulating vehicle systems. The results of a session should be recorded or inserted in a report produced by the simulator to easily document or share the findings of cybersecurity evaluations. Sessions should provide metrics on the cyber resiliency of evaluated systems, the details of any vulnerabilities and their severity, the consequences of exploits, and other system information. The solution will demonstrate the capability of generating physics-based models of controllers and devices from preexisting files and schematics such as transistor diagrams and CAD drawings. An intuitive method of generating models for simulation is necessary for efficiently reevaluating systems after design modifications are made to improve functionality or mitigate existing vulnerabilities. These capabilities will also support the efforts of engineers and developers in evaluating their systems without extensive backgrounds in cybersecurity. Deliverables should include a prototype of the software-based solution and source-code, simulator tools for fuzzing, glitching, and reproducible cyber-attacks, and reports and demonstrations assessing the full capabilities of the solution.","Expand the capabilities of the solution to simulate different environments and conditions to better reflect the operating environments of Army vehicles. The solution should ultimately be able to conduct cybersecurity evaluations against side-channel and sensor attacks, normally only possible to conduct on physical hardware due to the intricacies and physical properties involved in electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum. For instance, a side-channel attack is designed to pull critical data from electronics through the analysis of hardware power consumption or leaked electromagnetic waves. Physics-based modeling and simulation is necessary in order to emulate these attack scenarios and ultimately reduce hardware dependency for conducting cybersecurity evaluations. Through a combination of sophisticated algorithms and automation, tests could be conducted simultaneously on any number of components, including ports, connections, wires, chips, and devices. Generally, this task is made difficult for even a team of evaluators to perform due to the amount of factors at hand. This simulator would also need to be able to provide developers and engineers, who aren't versed in cybersecurity, the means to evaluate their software and hardware designs against ever expanding libraries of prefabricated cyber-attacks. User training and instructions should be developed to properly utilize this vehicle cybersecurity simulation software. These capabilities would promote the creation of more cyber-resilient systems throughout automotive and defense industries. Automotive companies could easily integrate this simulation technology into their processes for determining the cyber resiliency of their systems. Since tacking on cybersecurity measures becomes more expensive later on in the product development lifecycle, automotive companies could go as far as to require that their suppliers also utilize this solution to perform cybersecurity evaluations early on in development. Likewise, Army components such as Project Managers (PMs) can also implement similar requirements for defense contractors. Due to the flexibility of the solution, similar applications will be displayed in other fields with cyber-physical systems such as in aerospace and industrial control systems.",1,'Cybersecurity and Secure Deployments: Creating Effective Security with Simulation Technology'https://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/security/cybersecurity-and-secure-deployments/;; 'Hacking the CAN Bus: Basic Manipulation of a Modern Automobile Through CAN Bus Reverse Engineering'https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/awareness/hacking-bus-basic-manipulation-modern-automobile-through-bus-reverse-engineering-37825;; 'Automobile CAN Bus Network Security and Vulnerabilities'https://canvas.uw.edu/files/47669787/download?download_frd=1;; 'Side-Channel Vulnerabilities of Automobiles'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.680.3844& rep=rep1& type=pdf;; 'Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)'https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/automotive/hardware-in-the-loop.html,'Cybersecurity and Secure Deployments: Creating Effective Security with Simulation Technology'https://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/security/cybersecurity-and-secure-deployments/;; 'Hacking the CAN Bus: Basic Manipulation of a Modern Automobile Through CAN Bus Reverse Engineering'https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/awareness/hacking-bus-basic-manipulation-modern-automobile-through-bus-reverse-engineering-37825;; 'Automobile CAN Bus Network Security and Vulnerabilities'https://canvas.uw.edu/files/47669787/download?download_frd=1;; 'Side-Channel Vulnerabilities of Automobiles'http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.680.3844& rep=rep1& type=pdf;; 'Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)'https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/automotive/hardware-in-the-loop.html,9,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/84006/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/84006/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,DoD SBIR 2021.3 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,ARMY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 10:17:22,,,,,A21-115_84006,DOD_SBIR_2021_P1_C3_A21-115,,1,2025-08-09 19:51:31.995203+00

A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">Review requirements at at https://www.dcaa.mil/; &ldquo;Information for Contractors&rdquo; Guidebook.

Q38 (12/09/2020): In Volume III Cost Volume Job Aid, under paragraph 8, in the standard components selection there is no selection for the Fringe cost.  Our accounting system maintains three separate cost pools, Fringe, Overhead, and G&A.  How do we enter the information on the fringe costs?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">Review requirements at at https://www.dcaa.mil/; &ldquo;Information for Contractors&rdquo; Guidebook.

Q39 (12/09/2020): In Volume III Cost Volume Job Aid, under paragraph 8, it shows a budget amount of $125,000 with the resultant allocation against that amount.  The SBIR 21.4 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) states under paragraph b., page Army DPII 2,  that âFor this BAA, Department of the Army will accept Phase I proposals for the cost of up to $256,000â.  Which is correct $256.000 or $125,000?
A: The Army will consider proposals up to $256,000

Q40 (12/08/2020): Is the Commercialization Strategy limited to 2 pages (as listed in the ASO) or 5 pages (as listed in the BAA)?
A: 2 pages

Q41 (12/04/2020): Will there be an exclusion clause in the contract requiring that only the team listed under the proposal work on phase I?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">Contract terms will be negotiated with the Army upon selection.

Q42 (12/03/2020): Talent Development â What methods are in-scope for talent development? For example, is the emphasis on development through job placement, or does it also include formal education (e.g., degrees and schools) and self-paced learning (e.g., certificates from online training programs or industry certifications)?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">Formal and informal education as well as job experiences are all in-scope.

Q43 (12/03/2020): Data â In Phase I and/or Phase II, will performers have access to an existing pool of job descriptions, CVs and/or personnel data, or will some combination of real and test data need to be self-sourced/generated?  If available, will supplied data contain PII?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">The Army does not have data to provide, so performers will have to use their own data.

Q44 (12/03/2020): Skill Identification - When you reference âstandard CV/resume inputâ, would you please clarify what this includes? For example, is this public resume data (e.g., a LinkedIn profile) or does it also include non-public data such as a candidateâs military personnel file including training schools, academic credentials, past jobs, and performance assessment data?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">Skill identification could include data such as public resume data, academic credential, military personnel file, etc.

Q45 (12/03/2020): Talent Recruitment - Is it envisioned that âETLâ will be an MOS/branch/functional area (ie a career path) or simply a billet that someone fills for a tour of duty?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">ETL could be a designator in someone&rsquo;s personnel record that may result in them being recommended for particular billets, rather than an explicit MOS/branch or billet.

Q46 (12/03/2020): Talent Recruitment - Will ETLs include enlisted soldiers, warrant officers, and officers or just a subset of this group?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">The initial focus group is for commissioned officers.

Q47 (12/03/2020): Talent Recruitment - Is the goal of the talent recruitment to identify current uniformed service members for recruitment into the Emerging Technology Leader (ETL) role or to identify civilian candidates for recruitment into a uniformed ETL position (or both)?  If the intent in whole or part is to recruit civilians into uniformed service, is it envisioned that this will be an entry-level or through direct commissioning into higher ranks (and, if the latter, across what rank range)?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">Identify current uniformed service members for ETL designation.

Q48 (12/03/2020): Proposal - The footer of the ASO has the phrase âArmy DPIIâ. Usually, this indicated âDirect-to-Phase IIâ but page 2 of the ASO only references an award period and amount for Phase I. To confirm, this ASO is for Phase I submissions only?
A: <p style=""margin-bottom:10px"">Yes, this is for Phase I submissions only.

Q49 (12/03/2020): Proposal: BAA 21.4 Appendix A indicates that commercialization strategy should not exceed 5 pages; the ASO, on page 2, indicates that it should not exceed 2 pages.  Does the ASO govern?

Q53 (11/28/2020): Per page 1 of the SBO Announcement, the Army begins accepting proposals on December 8th, 2020 and all proposals must be received by January 12th, 2021. Will there be a rolling review and award of proposals or will the Army hold evaluations until after January 12th? Is the intent a single or multiple award for Phase I?
A: The Army will evaluate all proposals upon receipt in January 2021.&nbsp;

Q54 (11/28/2020): Per page 4 of the SBO Announcement, the Objective states that an ETL is a uniformed expert. However, the description of talent distribution states a requirement for predictive analytics for optimizing distribution of civilian/military/contractor talent across the force. Is the scope of this effort uniformed personnel only? Is the scope of this effort civilian, military, and contractor mix to fill talent requirements? Depending on the answer:
â¢	For the uniformed ETLs â does this effort include both commissioned and non-commissioned officers (NCOs)?  Warrant Officers?
â¢	For commissioned officers, are the ETLs identified after or before the career field designation process? 
â¢	For NCOs, at what point in the career development timeline will ETLs be identified?
A: <span lang=""EN"" style=""font-size:11.0pt;line-height:

AR-SA"">A solution that identifies ETL candidates in uniformed officers should generalize to civilians and NCOs. In a technical sense, an ETL possesses certain skills. Though the ETL program may only consider commissioned officers at this point as a policy choice, the same skills could be held by NCOs or civilians. </span>

Q55 (11/24/2020): The fifth bullet under the Description states that the tool should provide recommendations regarding ""Talent Distribution: Predictive analytics for optimizing distribution of civilian/military/contractor talent across the force."" This seems significantly broader than the objective of selecting uniformed personnel as candidate Emerging Technology Leaders. The announcement states that ETLs will be uniformed service members, not government civilians or contractors. Is this correct? If so, can the Government clarify the intent behind the fifth bullet?

A: Yes, the page limit listed in the solicitation is all encompassing. For details of what to include look at Appendix A and B.

Q2 (03/15/2021): What qualifies as matching funding? When do the matching funds need to be delivered?
A: Companies may propose to access an additional $500,000 in government funds to match private investment 1:1 during Phase II awards with this topic. Matching funding can take many forms including capital raised, IRAD, cost share or in kind contributions. The funds, whatever form it takes, must be applied to the project laid out in this solicitation. This match is optional and can occur at the beginning or at any time during Phase II (at the time of contracting, in the middle, towards the end).

Q3 (03/10/2021): I downloaded the Direct to Phase II template from W50RAJ-20-S-0001_SBIR_BAA_A214-002 at beta.sam, but it doesn't seem compatible with the instructions from W50RAJ-20-S-0001 or the need to demonstrate Phase I Proof of Feasibility. Is the white paper format critical, or can I just merge the two formats?
A: <p style=""margin-left:25px""><span style=""border:none windowtext 1.0pt; background:white; padding:0in"">The white paper format is optional. You may use whatever format you&rsquo;d like.</span>

Q4 (03/09/2021): Does the solicitation expect the cancellation to occur in the audio domain as well as the RF domains?
For example,  must multiple people be able to talk /listen at the same time such as using  a conference call system.
A: The interference cancellation can happen on the RF, digital, space domain. The concept behind is that the communication link is not degraded by self, friendly and unfriendly interference. Having multiple people that can talk and listen at the same time is desired.

Q5 (03/08/2021): I downloaded the Direct to Phase II template from W50RAJ-20-S-0001_SBIR_BAA_A214-002 at beta.sam, but it doesn't seem compatible with the instructions from W50RAJ-20-S-0001 or the need to demonstrate Phase I Proof of Feasibility.

Q6 (03/03/2021): Can the Army please indicate your intent regarding how the 100dB of self isolation would be tested?    It wouldn't seem sufficient to simply verify that one can transmit and receive on the same channel.  Most of our waveforms already do this now via CSMA or TDMA or some similar channel access method.

In a 50 node network - how would an observer know that any node is actually simultaneously, at a single instant, tx and rx on the same channel with 100dB of self interference isolation?  While most of our tactical radios now have a single port for both tx and rx, if we were to somehow RF loopback a separate output to the input then you wouldn't see the improvements gained via or antenna/free space  effects we might propose.  
 
If possible, a diagram of the Army intent for this test would ensure that our proposal aligns with Army expectations.
A: <p paraeid=""{e404bc02-60b6-4e54-aedd-3028930588b7}{240}"" paraid=""216289002"">Generally speaking, it is necessary to demonstrate SF-STAR capability between two radio nodes with no interference or other channel impairments. 100dB of self-interference suppression is suggested as an order-of-magnitude goal. How this is tested or demonstrated is to be defined and executed by the proposer. Since the government does not possess this&nbsp;technology, yet, no specific requirements have been established for it.&nbsp;

<p paraeid=""{e404bc02-60b6-4e54-aedd-3028930588b7}{252}"" paraid=""225310320"">The intent behind&nbsp;the 100dB of&nbsp;self isolation&nbsp;is if the communication system is transmitting at all times, 100% duty cycle the receiver should be capable to receive at all times 100% duty cycle without being degraded by the energy broadcast by the transmitter.&nbsp;

Q7 (02/24/2021): 1. What is the power level of high-power jammers at 3 km? 
2. Is there a spec for max power handling capability of the receive system?
3. Is there a preferred target band or platform that you would prefer to start with?
4. Will you accept solutions that include antenna isolation and/or nulling and beamforming as part of the solution?
5. 100dB isolation will likely require a combination of approaches (e.g. analog canceller and digital canceller cascaded in series). Will you accept a partial solution such as an analog front-end canceller that can be cascaded with a digital canceller from another party or vice versa?
6. Would you be interested in a solution that reserves FPGA resources to implement third-party digital cancellation algorithms and load sets?
7. Would you be interested in solutions that include an FPGA to host SDR IP rather than using off-the-shelf SDR hardware?
8. Would you be interested in a modular solution that has swappable front-end modules connected to a common digital backend/SDR to achieve scalability across frequency? 
9. Would you consider solutions that only address a subset of the interference sources but are scalable to include mitigation techniques against all interference sources with additional development? For example, an SF-STAR system with nulling capabilities for off-platform interference that could be expanded to include tethered-interference mitigation with additional hardware.
A: <ol>
	<li>
	The specifics of interference, especially enemy capabilities are classified and cannot be revealed.&nbsp;

	The vendor can make assumptions on what is your SNR at 1 Km (greater distance is preferred) and define how much interference from an interferer 3 Km away the vendor system will be able to mitigate &nbsp;
	</li>
	<li>
	Generally speaking, each radio manufacturer has its own performance specs in this regard; the proposer can review them to gain technology and industry fluency. There are no specifications for this related to the current work since it is not a prime purpose of the work.&nbsp;The use case being considered is the receiver will be exposed to a loud transmitter that can broadcast in the tenths of watts in the same platform or very close (tenths of meters)&nbsp;
	</li>
	<li>
	There is no specific frequency band that is targeted for this technology. Army tactical ground operations use typical published bands:&nbsp;VHF(30-88Mhz); UHF(225-450MHz); L-Band(1GHz-2GHz). The Army does use HF and &gt;2GHz(satellite) bands, but these are not considered primary goals at this time for this work.&nbsp;
	</li>
	<li>
	Whereas a complete SF-STAR device would be most desirable in this work, the Army is aware of the difficulties involved. Any individual or partial, method or technique that contributes to SF-STAR capability is of interest to the Army and will be considered in this solicitation.&nbsp;For any partial solution or technique, the proposer should present its place and utility in a total SF-STAR solution.&nbsp;

Q8 (02/19/2021): For the threshold of 50 nodes, is the expectation that 50 people (voice data) will be speaking at the same time (simultaneous) on the same channel? The requirement is operation the same frequency which leads me to believe you want all radios on a shared media without any separation or organization.  How will that threshold be measured?
A: The primary goal of this SIBR work is intended to show SF-STAR operation between&nbsp;four&nbsp;radio nodes. It is considered beyond the scope of this SIBR work to require showing multi-node routing and networking technologies, though SF-STAR radio systems of the future will certainly have that capability. In SF-STAR, using an IP-based communication concept, many users will be using a single carrier, though, it is not imagined that the, as yet undefined, networking and routing protocols would allow collisions at any one receiver, as far as is possible.&nbsp;This solicitation is looking for ideas of how an SF-STAR network can be scale up to 50 nodes and efficiently utilized.&nbsp;",,Electronics,1,Electronics,Control and Communications | Network Command,Control and Communications | Network Command,2,"<p>Self Frequency Simultaneous Transmit And Receive (SF-STAR), Full Duplex, Untethered Interference, Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR), Software Defined Radio (SDR), In-Band Full-Duplex (IBFD), Self-Interference Cancellation (SIC)</p>",1,"<p>Self Frequency Simultaneous Transmit And Receive (SF-STAR), Full Duplex, Untethered Interference, Simultaneous Transmit and Receive (STAR), Software Defined Radio (SDR), In-Band Full-Duplex (IBFD), Self-Interference Cancellation (SIC)</p>",No,0,No,,"Provide four prototypes adapted from commercial off the shelf (COTS) software defined radios (SDR's) capable of operating in the same frequency while simultaneously transmitting and receiving (SF-STAR) voice and data from external sources and capable of performing network operations in congested, contested and denied environments.

This solicitation is looking for solutions of suppressing friendly interference, whether co-located in the same platform, or, in the general presence of other potential interfering sources while performing SF-STAR.","There is a need for our Army warfighters to be able to share mission critical information from the battlefield like voice, video, and data while operating in contested and congested tactical environments. Frequency spectrum is very limited, especially overseas. In order to continue mission critical communication and share more information, technologies that can increase spectral efficiency are needed. As a result, the US Army is constantly looking for technologies that can reduce interference and improve spectrum efficiency. SF-STAR is a potential solution to this problem and it offers the capability to double the bandwidth capacity for several applications in the DoD community. Benefits of this technology on tactical radio systems include, but are not limited to increased spectrum efficiency, higher bandwidths, and less co-site interference. Full duplex is one of the big promises for 5G wireless communications. The target of this solicitation is to develop innovative radio handheld or manpack prototypes capable of performing SF-STAR when operating in tactical environments. As self-interference is still one of the biggest challenges for SF-STAR, the prototypes should be able to operate in congested, contested, and denied environments where the radios are exposed to both untethered intended and unintended interference.The Army is interested in SF-STAR technologies with a constellation of features that can include but are not limited to the following: Characteristic Threshold (Objective) TX/RS Isolation [dB] 100 (120) Latency [ms] 30 (10) Range [km] 1 (10) Simultaneous Nodes 50 (150) System Final Cost Per Radio[$] 5k (2k) SWaP Vehicle-mounted (handheld) Interference cancellation Static (dynamic) Power scalability (W) 2 (5) Network type MANET (No Infrastructure) Ability to operate multiple bands (e.g.: HF, UHF, L, S, C, Ka, Ku, mmWave) Ability to support multiple bandwidths (e.g.: 1. 2, 5, 10, 20, 250, 500, 1000 MHz) Anti-jam Resilience from high power jammer at 3km",298,1997,1,No,No,No,,"This ASO is accepting DP2 proposals only. Proposers must demonstrate technical feasibility of an integrated SF-STAR system to include electronics, firmware, software, and packaging on a commercial of-the-shelf (COTS) software-defined radio (SDR), evaluated for deployment in Army applications. Develop a preliminary system design, model key elements of the proposed radio, and identify subcomponents that demonstrate a clear path to achieving a competitive isolation factor on a mobile testbed. Phase I deliverables include a design review with expected device performance as well as quarterly reports and a final report presenting Phase II plans.Proposals will be evaluated on a holistic basis based on the value they provide to the Army, allowing for solutions with a different constellation of features to be scored based on size, weight, power, cost (SWaP-C), ease of integration into Army systems, modular architecture to allow for easy component upgrades, and scalability to higher power applications and/or handheld solutions.","Develop and deliver four minimum viable products (TRL6 prototypes) of a SF-STAR-technology integrated onto a COTS SDR which demonstrates SF-STAR on the move. The total development cost should not exceed $1.5M over the 24-month period of performance. In the first 12 months companies will be asked to validate performance of two proposed systems in a tactical environment in the presence of Electronic Attack (EA). In the second 12-month period, vendors will be asked to demonstrate the technology of the four final prototypes in a tactical environment in the presence of EA. In addition, companies will submit monthly performance reports and a final report not later than (NLT) 30 dates of the end of the period of performance (POP). Demonstrations at the end of each year-long design effort will be conducted at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) and Fort Dix, so companies should include travel costs for these in their proposal.The radios need to be configured in a mounted platform, and the prototypes need to have the capability to tether to two interference sources and handle at least two untethered interference sources (intended or unintended) while operating in SF-STAR. When the radios are configured in a dismounted application, the prototypes should have the capability to handle at least four untethered interference sources (intended or unintended) while operating in SF-STAR. The prototypes should target mitigating interference of 30 dB with a bandwidth up to 20 MHz above the signal of interest (SOI) from untethered sources. The prototypes should be able to mitigate the interference from tethered sources for at least 100 dB at the receiver, not including the antenna isolation between the transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX). The prototypes should be able to pass and receive voice without the need of push for talk. The prototypes should be implemented in commercial software defined radios capable of operating at UHF, L, S and C bands and support multiple bandwidths (1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 MHz). The TX/RX path isolation should be enough to not degrade the radio sensitivity level (RSL) of the radio for the bandwidth of operation. Techniques such as analog/digital/antenna/RF cancellation, RF suppression, and waveform implementation could be utilized. SF-STAR technology should be implemented inside the COTS radios operating at the aforementioned bands and bandwidths. Appropriate modifications to the COTS radio hardware architecture and software (antenna, Radio Frequency Front End) and software (algorithms, FPGA firmware, MAC, network layers, etc.) need to be made in order to deliver four prototypes to the Army at the end of phase II.","Phase III efforts will focus on integrating into the Army Program of Record Handheld, Manpack and Small Form-Fit (HMS) radios. The SWAP, interference mitigation for tethered and untethered interference, the capability of handling multiple types of interference signals, and techniques for making the waveform more resilient need to be matured to the appropriate technology readiness level [TRL6+] to meet DoD and commercial application requirements. Phase III efforts should extend the Phase II prototype capabilities to be C5ISR/EW Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS) compatible and support additional frequency bands [HF/mmWave]. The Phase III work should also target porting SF-STAR capability to COTS wireless systems such as cell phones. Low-rate production will occur as required. Support Government-sponsored test activities. Potential commercial uses include 6G wireless communications to include doubled spectral efficiency, reduced latency, and improved scalability to mesh networking. Phase III deliverables include system-level integration, technical data packages, and system-level prototype for demonstration and government-sponsored testing.",1,"Brynn King, Jingjing Xia, and Slim Boumaiza, 'Digitally Assisted RF-Analog Self Interference Cancellation for Wideband Full-Duplex Radios', IEEE Transactions On Circuits And Systems—II: Express Briefs, VOL. 65, NO. 3, March 2018.; Manjesh K.

A: Specific sensors are not mandated. Your proposal will define the sensor data needed by the capability you propose to portray. You specify what data is necessary and you provide your own data streams. The potential sensor data that soldiers may generate in the future includes (but is not limited to): heart rate, PLI, IMUs, visual sensors, LIDAR, EMG, GSR.

Q12 (03/10/2021): How is the exoskeleton data formatted?
A: No standard format has been determined. Phase I is to develop or leverage an open architecture, API, or ICD that interfaces with exoskeletons, ATAK/Nett Warrior, and any other required sensor.

Q13 (03/10/2021): What exoskeleton should we use to generate data?
A: The goal is to be hardware agnostic. We challenge you to be creative in what data would be the most appropriate to determine the types of actionable information that will make the soldier and squad more lethal.

Q14 (03/08/2021): In the Topic detail it references the ""the ability to integrate with ATAK/NW""  Can you provide details on your desired options for integration?
A: Data can be integrated via Bluetooth or connected to the Nett Warrior USB hub.

Q2 (04/05/2021): Where are the requirements for the technical volume posted? The BAA states that ""The length of the technical volume will be specified by the corresponding 
ASO. The Government will not consider pages in excess of the page count limitations."" Perhaps this was discussed in the webinar; however, I am unable to locate the ""links to video recordings of the webinars"" that are cited in the topic description.
A: The requirements for this topic can be found in the solicitation, linked here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://beta.sam.gov/opp/013ce499fee1471885cce5ba42a6dda2/view?keywords=%22lc%20lpd%22&amp;sort=-relevance&amp;index=&amp;is_active=true&amp;page=1"">LC/LPD solicitation</a><br />
Please read the solicitation thoroughly.

A template for Phase I and Phase II proposals can be found at the following link:&nbsp;<a href=""https://aal.army/spartn/"">SPARTN - Army Applications Laboratory - AAL</a>

Q3 (04/01/2021): âThe BAA specifies that the waveform should be robust under sever interference and degraded conditions.  Is there a specific scenario for sever interference and degraded conditions that the waveform will be evaluated against?â
A: There is no specific scenario at this time.&nbsp;

Q4 (03/24/2021): The Phase 2 description specifies that LC/LPD technology will be integrated onto existing Army technology.  Is it the Army's intention that the LPD waveform itself be ported to the the GFE equipment, or, will the LC/LPD radio remain a separate component that integrated with the existing GFE through the Ethernet/USB interface?

If the waveform implementation is to be hosted on the GFE:  (1) Can you specify what this platform is and/or the characteristics such as CPU, FPGA and RFIC part numbers? This would be very helpful to ensure the proposed waveform approach is compatible with the GFE platform. (2) Is it a requirement that the GFE platform be used in Phase 2 or can another platform for development and demonstration?

If the integration is  through the Ethernet/USB interface, will the integration APIs be prescribed and, if so, when will the definition of these APIs be made available?
A: The LC/LPD radio should remain a separate component that will be integrated onto a vehicle (physical mounting and DC power). The LC/LPD radio will be integrated with the vehicle&rsquo;s networking equipment through the Ethernet/USB interface. The existing GFE will also be connected to the vehicle&rsquo;s networking equipment via Ethernet.

The waveform implementation will not be hosted on the GFE.

The vendor should identify, select, and procure a suitable platform for development and demonstration.

Q5 (03/24/2021): The description of the anticipated structure/award information indicates that ""For this ASO Department of the Army will accept Phase I proposals for the cost of up to $250,000. This includes a 3-month base period not to exceed $200,000 and a 2-month option period not to exceed $50,000."" but later in the Phase I description it simply states ""Phase I will award $200,000 over a 3 month period"".  Can you confirm that it is acceptable for the Phase I proposal and associated cost volume to include both the 3-month base period ($200k) and 2-month option period ($50k)?
A: There IS a 2-month option period, not to exceed $50,000. This statement:&nbsp;&quot;For this ASO Department of the Army will accept Phase I proposals for the cost of up to $250,000. This includes a 3-month base period not to exceed $200,000 and a 2-month option period not to exceed $50,000.&quot; is correct.

Q6 (03/18/2021): Our group may subcontract with a major research university which is not prepared to follow ITAR protocols. Can we segment the tasks assigned to the University so that they focus on tasks that would not be ITAR controlled? Specifically can they focus on concepts, protocols and technologies that are in the public domain?

Also, will we be required to enter into a DD2345 during  Phase l or Phase ll of this  LC/LPD topic?

Thanks
A: We unfortunately cannot allow segmenting with the ITAR protocols. You will have to follow the protocols as they stand. We will not be entering into a DD254 in phase 1 or 2 at this time.

Q7 (03/15/2021): Apologies if this question is repeated.  I received a pop-up that the question was successfully submitted, but no confirmation email. 

The announcement seems to be looking for an enhancement to an existing LOS waveform in terms of the detectability of cyclostationary features, but also seems to be seeking backward compatibly.    Does the Army have in mind a particular directional LOS legacy waveform it is seeking to enhance (i.e. HNW, Tri-LOS/HCLOS) with the LPD waveform?   
If HNW, will the Army be able to provide an HNR/HRFU as GFE?
A: LC/LPD seeks to develop and implement omnidirectional low data rate LPD communications that will be used for remote management and control of other high data rate directional communications systems.&nbsp;The system in mind at the moment is not any of the ones you listed. That being said we would provide more information upon award. But the interface of the system&nbsp;has a command line interface&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;by&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;&nbsp;10/100/1000 Mbps&nbsp;

Q8 (03/15/2021): Is there a specific metric regarding what would constitute success for this LC/LPD waveform development effort?   Is it sufficient that it just be cyclostationary featureless, or are we also striving for something additional such as a minimum Eb/No or improvement of Eb/No over some legacy waveform performance?
A: The waveform should be featureless from a&nbsp;cylclostationary&nbsp;standpoint and operate below the noise floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Q9 (03/15/2021): The announcement appears to be addressing perceived shortfalls in terms of the  detectability (due to  the cyclostationary features) of directional OTM LOS systems near the the FLOT.    The announcement also seems to be seeking backward compatibility with legacy systems (in unlicensed bands?)  and a path proposed for enhancement of existing radios to support this LPD enhancement.   We assume the Army would want to receive  proposals optimized to align to the Army best interests rather than have vendors guess which radio/waveform is being considered for this LPD enhancement and risk proposals that are not addressing the correct use case(s) .   Does the Army have a preferred legacy radio/waveform it is targeting for this enhancement (eg Tri-LOS/HCLOS or HNW)?    If HNW, is the Army able to provide HRFU and HNRs as GFE?
A: LC/LPD seeks to develop and implement omnidirectional low data rate LPD communications that will be used for remote management and control of other high data rate directional communications systems.&nbsp;This is not related to any legacy waveforms or systems the&nbsp;system in mind at the moment is not any of the ones you listed.

The waveforms used for communications in these environments typically exhibit cyclic properties and have increasingly become more susceptible to detection and even classification by expert signal identification systems that use techniques such as cyclostationary detection. To overcome this impairment, waveforms must exhibit featureless properties under extremely low SNR conditions in the time and frequency domain for resilient Low Probability of Detection (LPD). Additionally, a low-cost waveform is important to the Army as this LPD waveform will be paired with existing directional communications systems and must be affordable to the Army as a secondary or tertiary system. Of particular interest is a waveform that maintains LPD in the presence of sophisticated electronic support systems near the forward line of troops (FLOT). While directional systems can offer LPD, many existing directional systems use omnidirectional scanning modes and beacons to determine the spatial location of neighboring nodes. Using such techniques makes systems susceptible to detection by an adversary. Pairing directional systems with a featureless waveform which supports out-of-band link management is highly desirable. The waveform should be able to perform operations such as neighbor node discovery, network handshaking, waveform control messages, emergency chat, and emergency low data rate transfers.The waveform should be robust under severe interference and degraded (e.g. foliated, etc.) conditions and be able to be paired and synchronized with an existing Army directional system. The waveform should exhibit noise-like characteristics at very low Signal to Noise (SNR) ratios and be resilient against higher order cyclostationary detection techniques in the time and frequency domains. Frequency bands of operation for this waveform could be anywhere from VHF through C-band. Higher band operation may be considered, however propagation range of multiple kilometers is important and likely difficult to achieve at higher frequencies. Low latency is also desirable to support on-the-move applications. The LPD waveform should not rely on external GPS for Position Location Information (PLI). Lastly, the low-cost LPD waveform radio platform should add minimal SWAP-C to a vehicle host platform.

Q2 (05/05/2021): Is the US Army willing to entertain solutions based on development of a recoil sub-assembly?  The topic narrative and answers to questions below trend solely towards baseplate solutions.  However, also cited below is a previous composite baseplate that failed at 100 kips (when the goal was presumably 500 tons?).  Assuming that this previous baseplate was competently engineered and fabricated, seeking a 10x improvement seems unreasonably risky.  
In comparison, a recoil-based approach has not been tried for a long time, at least to our knowledge.  While recoil assemblies are well-understood, and ubiquitously employed world-wide, the challenge would be to greatly reduce its weight, bulk, and cost so that it is comparable to a simple welded or cast (or lay-up) baseplate - also risky, but arguably less so.  
New damper technology is now available, exclusively through us, which MAY have the capability to overcome the impediments of current-technology recoil assemblies (weight, bulk, HAZMAT, logistics, and cost).  We recently demonstrated attenuation of a 20 tons peak recoil to only 450 lbs (a 90:1 reduction), using only seven inches of travel.  The damper assembly weighed less than two lbs and can sustain repeated shots.  We would propose to up-scale the damper for this application, plus provide custom interface brackets to adapt it to the mortar. 
If open to such an approach, request you provide the barrel mass, projectile mass, and muzzle velocity for each mortar.  We agree that these would be unnecessary to redesign the baseplate, but as you can see, we need them for feasibility calculations in accordance with Newton's Second Law.  We must insist on being provided with this information up-front, not at time of award, to avoid wasting time and effort for all of us.  Thank you.
A: This topic closed for new questions on 4 May 2021.

Q3 (04/30/2021): Is the total impulse (force*time units) known for the 81mm and 120mm baseplates?  If so, please provide.
A: Peak force is given in topic. Rise time is on the order of 10ms

Q4 (04/30/2021): Is this topic limited to composite materials or are metal re-designs allowed?  The objective statement has the phrase ""(i.e. of a composite material or structure)"" which makes it seem limited to composites.
A: Yes. Provided those designs can meet the weight (under 20lbs) and cost ($3k) goals

Q5 (04/29/2021): I have 3 questions:
1.	What is the interface takeover point between baseplate and cannon?  Does this proposal include ball socket joint design?

2.	Can you provide drawing and material specifications for â 
a.	Current base plate and spades
b.	Socket 
c.	Spherical Ball
d.	Cushioning/Retaining Ring

3.    Does the current design remain stable in wet soil and sand?
A: 1.&nbsp;Design is ball and socket. Interface details will be provided to the awardee

2. Drawings will be provided to the awardee&nbsp;

3. Yes

Q6 (04/28/2021): Will proposals be considered for baseplate designs featuring advanced high strength metallic alloys and associated advanced manufacturing processing, which can meet all design and cost requirements? Or is the intent to fund only non-metallic (i.e., composite) structures?
A: Yes. Provided those designs can meet the weight (under 20lbs) and cost ($3k) goals

Q7 (04/27/2021): What is the mass (weight) of the tube (barrel?) of each mortar?

For each mortar projectile, what is the mass (weight) and muzzle velocity?  

Thank you.
A: That data will be provided to the awardee if needed for some reason. However there is no need for that data in traditional baseplate design. &nbsp;The firing impulse is given in the topic. &nbsp;That is the force level to which the baseplates are currently proofed to.

Q8 (04/26/2021): Is the subject topic a Phase I or a Direct to Phase II  (DPII). While it appears to be a Phase I based on the text, the footer on the ASO suggests that it is a DPII (presumably Direct to Phase II). Please advise.
A: Apologies for the confusion. This is a Phase I topic.

Q9 (04/26/2021): Would a complete overhaul of the baseplate design be accepted? What restrictions do we have for this?
A: Existing materials are acceptable so long as the resulting structure meets requirements.

Q10 (04/23/2021): What was the reason for failure of composite base plates?
A: Details about unsuccessful efforts with past composite material solutions are in the referenced papers. In testing they failed around 100 kips.

Q11 (04/23/2021): Would a solution meeting the performance, weight, and cost requirements that does not use carbon composite be responsive to the solicitation?
A: Yes. Existing materials are acceptable so long as the resulting structure meets requirements, but they do not need to be existing materials.

Q12 (04/23/2021): We request some clarification in regard to the previous question re: ""barrel weight"".  By barrel weight is meant the weight of the ""tube"" that launches the projectile, plus the weight of the swivel fitting at the rear/bottom end of the tube, plus the fittings that adapt the tube to the legs (but not the weight of the legs themselves), plus the weight of sighting/aiming apparatus that is attached to the tube.  (You may combine answers to this question and the previous question is you wish).
A: That data will be provided to the awardee if needed for some reason. However there is no need for that data in traditional baseplate design. &nbsp;The firing impulse is given in the topic. &nbsp;That is the force level to which the baseplates are currently proofed to.

Q13 (04/23/2021): Request the following information for each of the two mortars discussed in the SBIR Topic:  barrel mass, projectile mass, and projectile muzzle velocity.
A: That data will be provided to the awardee if needed for some reason. However there is no need for that data in traditional baseplate design. &nbsp;The firing impulse is given in the topic. &nbsp;That is the force level to which the baseplates are currently proofed to.

Q14 (04/13/2021): ""Demonstrate that the material is an improvement over the standard carbon fiber and epoxy materials"" What are the metrics that should be considered for evaluating ""improvement?"" The solicitation notes that production version are made of cast aluminum or steel weldment; are there are also production versions currently made out of 'Endurance 4505A resin w/ 4506B hardener'?
A: <font color=""#1f497d""><font face=""Calibri"">Composite ones were never put into production as they failed proof testing.&nbsp; So the material / design must survive a proof test</font></font>

Q15 (04/13/2021): What are the expected long term production quantities for the 81mm and 120mm base plates?
A: That is dependent upon when the plate is put into production. A full qualification program would be required first. Production could be 30-50 a month.

Q16 (04/12/2021): Can you share which specific material the current metal baseplate is made from?  We assume it is a certain grade of steel or cast iron.
A: Current 81 and 60 mm baseplates are cast aluminum.&nbsp; 120mm baseplates are welded steel.&nbsp; Material specifics can be shared with the awardee.

Q17 (04/12/2021): What is the typical maximum temperatures the base plates experience during routine and/or repetitive usage?
A: <span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Ambient so no more than 180F</span>

Q18 (04/09/2021): Are there specific interface features from the current design which need to be replicated in the SBIR proposal one?
A: <span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Yes, the socket for engaging the gun tube will need to be replicated.&nbsp; Details will be provided to the Phase I awardees.</span>

Q20 (04/09/2021): Are there other requirements beyond the structural ones listed in the solicitation such as corrosion resistance, conductivity, etc?
A: <span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Needs to interface with current mortar tube (details will be provided to awardee) and must be paintable with CARC paint</span>

Q21 (04/08/2021): Is it possible to receive the drawings of the present design?
A: Drawings of existing designs can be provided to the awardee. Design envelope and pictures of previous designs (metal and composite) are given in the AMPE and Army Science Conference papers in the references.

Q22 (04/07/2021): Is Phase I space claim 2 ft diameter by 6 inch tall for M3A2 81mm baseplate only?
A: <span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Yes that is the space claim for the current M3A2.</span>

Q23 (04/05/2021): Several questions;
1) This topic seems to be written like as if a new material solution is necessary to meet requirements (for example, Phase I base includes instruction to provide one pound of sample material as a Phase I  deliverable). Would a proposal to develop a new baseplate design that only requires existing composite materials, without requiring any new material development, be equally acceptable if the proposed design meets all cost, weight and durability requirements and avoids issues with the previous attempts at a composite solution described in the solicitation?
2) Can dimensioned drawings be provided for the baseplates?
3) Load are described in the solicitation, but not deflection requirements. Can load and deflection requirements both be provided?
4) Can a full set of test requirements nd/or descriptions be provided?
5) Is there a leveling requirement? Can you describe issues how irregular ground, clearance and leveling (If necessary) are currently addressed?
A: 1. <font color=""#1f497d""><font face=""Calibri"">Existing materials are acceptable so long as the resulting structure meets requirements</font></font>

<font color=""#1f497d""><font face=""Calibri"">2. </font></font><span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">Drawings of existing designs can be provided to the awardee. &nbsp;Design envelope and pictures of previous designs (metal and composite) are given in the SAMPE and Army Science Conference papers in the references</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">3. There is no specific deflection requirement other than that they should not be so large as to cause the baseplate to rebound after firing</span>

<span style=""color: rgb(31, 73, 125); font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"">4.

These structures often consist of a flat plate with spades on the bottom to interface with the ground. The plate is normally connected to the main structure via a strut and ball-and-socket joint allowing for the plate to adjust to uneven ground. This arrangement means that the load can go through the plate at various angles. The plate also needs to interact with various soil conditions in addition to loads coming from different angles and directions. This tends to result in very heavy and robust metallic structures, which can be a severe detriment to any systems that need to be relocated by hand. For current applications the production versions of these plates are made of cast aluminum or a steel weldment.The Army is looking for lightweight baseplate design that is resistant to the impulse load of the mortar round (which can be up to 500 kips of force) and can be made to conform to the plate with spades design. The material and associated fabrication method should also be low cost such that the final baseplates are in the same price range as current metal ones (no more than $3000.00 for an M3A2 81mm baseplate and $16,600.00 for a M9A1 120mm baseplate). The system should have a fatigue life at least as good as its metallic counterpart (which means it functions correctly for 3,000 firing cycles). The final space claim of the new ground interface plate should also be roughly the same as the old one. The system weight should be less than the current systems, ideally under 20 lbs for an 81mm baseplate and under 100 lbs for a 120mm baseplate.",291,1695,1,No,No,No,,"Develop and demonstrate a system that is resistant to impact loading.

However, in the Dept. of the Army SBIR Program 21.4 BAA ASO Announcement issued on 1 April 2021 in topic A214-007 the Phase I description states âPhase I will consist of a modeling and feasibility study that will result in laboratory bench top prototype conversion screens being manufactured and then demonstrating their performance requirements in a laboratory setting.â and continues, âThe contractor is responsible for providing the prototype detector to the neutron source facility and providing any personnel support required.â This suggests that the Phase I description and the Question Answer seem to be in conflict. Would the TPOC please provide clarification on whether the Topic Description or the Question Answer is the correct approach for Phase I? If we propose a plan that produces a prototype at the end of Phase I, will that be considered a compliant response to the SBIR Topic?
A: This topic closed for new questions on 4 May 2021.

Q2 (04/19/2021): Topic A214-007: Digital High-Energy Neutron Radiography
Q1: Are you looking for construction of neutron imager from commercially available off-the-shelf products?
Q2: The topic mentions âmodeling and feasibility studiesâ. Do you require simulating the detector by using MCNP or GEANT simulations (or something similar)? 
Q3: Is the cost for the neutron source facility separate from funding or will the contractor need to arrange the cost for the facility from the phase 1 funding? Is the contractor free to choose other available facilities at national labs or universities, that may partner in the proposal?
A: 1.&nbsp;The Phase I requirement is to develop and then provide conversion screens to be used in conjunction with either a commercial off the shelf (COTS) silicon-based digital detector panel or some other custom/in-house digital detector panel. However, if such screens only work with a custom/in-house digital detector panel then this solution can only be considered if this type detector panel will be available to the US Army for future use/purchase and would have to be readily available, cost effective, robust, dependable, maintainable and have a reasonable form-factor such that it can be retro-fitted into standardized existing mounting applications. It is for these reasons that it is preferred that a COTS detector be employed as the basis for this solution.

2.&nbsp;It is expected that a detector modeling capability may need to be employed during this developmental work.

3.&nbsp;The contractor will need to make arrangements and if need be to provide the funding to gain access/use of a neutron source for Phase I testing but it is very strongly encouraged that the contractor engage with arranging for access for testing at a facility that employs a source which outputs high-energy neutrons on average in the 6-8MeV range of energies. As appropriate, the US Army can provide guidance on this if need be. The contractor is free to partner with national labs and/or universities.

Q3 (04/19/2021): is this effort only for imaging of high energy neutrons? Is the combination of a moderator and thermal neutron imaging a possibility?
A: The desired result here is a high-energy neutron radiography imaging capability. If in addition to this a thermal neutron capability using the same detector technology is also delivered that would be a plus but only if the high-energy capability is not compromised in any way. In other words, the only requirement is for high-energy neutron imaging and success will only be defined by the high-energy capability. All things being equal, if two competing designs yield the exact same high-energy capability but one also provides for a thermal capability then only under this scenario would the thermal capability be perceived as an advantage.

Q4 (04/16/2021): 1.	Is there an imaging time limit? Often for NDT imaging analysis, time is of the essence. Is there a requirement for this novel method to provide images of components within a given time limit? 
2.	What are the maximum and minimum target sizes the Army is interested in obtaining? Is there a characteristic subject size we could target?
3.	Does the Army have a requirement for image resolution in terms of defects in materials, for example, mm vs nm? Are there threshold requirements for the Phase I prototype? What is the minimum spatial resolution, sensitivity, SNR, and efficiency expected of a Phase I prototype?
4.	What other information can you provide about the neutron source envisioned for use in this application by the TPOC, including the reaction being used and the time structure of the source (e.g., CW, periodic, or pulsed)? What is the flux at the imaging point?
A: 1.&nbsp;Of course imaging time is a vital factor. However, there are circumstances when the quality of the resultant image is of far greater importance than the time allotted to obtain this image. Under these circumstances there would be consideration given to allowing for exposure times of multiple hours. But in general, for daily expected usage it is desired that exposure times would be in no more than in single digits of minutes and not in hours. There are plans to also do high-energy neutron radiography CT where many images will be required and thus since we want to be able to do a CT in the course of being limited to one single work day of 8 hours this would necessitate each individual image to be performed in no more than single digits of minutes.

2.&nbsp;If by target size it is the size of the object to be imaged that is the question then we refer to our desire to have a detector area of imaging size that is the standard 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; radiography size. Since this Phase I effort is only a white paper and technical design plan and thus an actual detector does not need to be built and delivered with the provided Phase I funding, as long as there are no technical reasons that the proposed technology can not be scaled up in the future (Phase II) to 11&rdquo; x17&rdquo; nor any prohibited costs to do such, then all proposals may be considered.

3.&nbsp;The current COTS conversion screen technology when coupled to a COTS digital detector panel, allows for spatial resolution of approximately 40 mil or 1 mm. It is hoped that this can be significantly improved upon with this SBIR effort. Sensitivity, SNR, conversion efficiency and screen/detector lifetime are all very important and it is expected that all will be optimized, however, it is the spatial resolution that is the primary need here.&nbsp;

Such a commercial detector panel does not currently exist. Over the past decade much time and effort has been invested in an electronically produced source of high-energy neutrons for performing NR to great success. It is currently available at a commercial facility. This SOTA source requires an equally SOTA detector in order to achieve optimal results. Neutron Radiography is now performed by using a detector which is optimized for X-radiography that is then modified via the addition of a conventional conversion screen, allowing for sufficient NR to be performed. Neutron radiography is so important because whereas X-radiography highlights possible defects in the high-density components of a munition, neutron radiography highlights defects in the lower density regions, even when these lower density regions are obscured by high density steel components. Thus, energetic fill and voids, gaskets, o-rings and any low-density components will show up better using NR than using traditional X-radiography. This NR technique will serve as an important complement to the current traditional X-radiography and will allow for more thorough inspections of ammunition and armaments. Requirements for the detector panel include an overall size, weight and power draw that is compatible with the current industry standard for an 11""x 17"" usable imaging area silicon-based digital detector panel and connection to a standard computer for download of images. Long lifetime use equates to at least one (1) year of half-time (20 hours beam-on time per 40 hour work week) operation without degradation. Specific requirements for high spatial resolution, high sensitivity, high signal to noise ratio (SNR), and high conversion efficiency will be determined during Phase I.",295,1969,1,No,No,No,,"Phase I will consist of a modeling and feasibility study that will result in laboratory bench top prototype conversion screens being manufactured and then demonstrating their performance requirements in a laboratory setting.

The contractor is responsible for providing the prototype detector to the neutron source facility and providing any personnel support required. The contractor can assume the facility is Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. The main focus of the testing will be to demonstrate and quantify spatial resolution, sensitivity, SNR and efficiency. The Phase I option will finalize the requirements specification to guide development in Phase II.","Phase II will further mature the technology to ascertain and weigh any compromises on the requirements so the end result is the best possible detector panel.

Q2 (04/26/2021): What are the currently available low-cost mass fabrication techniques?
In what time frame must the reserve battery be activated?
Provide examples of safety and security issues following events during a munitionâs ballistic flight.
A: 1.&nbsp;There will be compatibilities of potential electrochemistries with advanced manufacturing methods.&nbsp; These compatibilities need to be addressed.

2.&nbsp;1 millisecond

3.&nbsp;There are fire no fire safety issues to make sure that the reserve power source remains not activated unless the appropriate inertial stimuli occurs,&nbsp;this needs to be addressed.

Q3 (04/17/2021): What is required energy, size, and weight?
A: The configurations for the battery on the chip&nbsp;need to be flexible to achieve multiple voltage levels and current levels.&nbsp;The objective is to provide feasible configurations for storing energy in a micro-miniature foot print.&nbsp; The feasible proposed technologies must also include methods to maintain the ionic transport medium separated from the electrodes.&nbsp; I define the ionic transport or charge transport in general to provide proposers with options for their approaches.&nbsp; It follows that the proposers must also provide their approaches for methods of advanced manufacturing to enable the required miniaturization of the final product.

Q4 (04/15/2021): Will you entertain other suitable means of energy storage other than chemical batteries?
A: In terms of battery chemistry, please consider advanced manufacturing,&nbsp; then design a feasibility study (s) to determine what is best.

Q5 (04/15/2021): Can you comment on the volumetric and gravimetric energy densities of interest? (or compare these to common battery sources such as Lithium Ion, etc.)
Also, what is one example of a real SWaP requirement, energy storage amount and power delivery amount during discharge?
A: This particular topic is looking for micro-miniature integration of energy storage into electronic circuits. It could also take the form of a stand alone micro-miniature carrier which embeds stored energy for integration into electronic circuitry. Because this topic can span into a much larger area of power and energy for munitions, the emphasis needs to be on miniaturization of the power source and highly advanced embedded integration into fuzing system for holding energy for precision guidance tasks.&nbsp;This topic has to have a significant component of advanced manufacturing, and proposers must also keep the cost of manufacturing in mind. There will be compatibilities of potential electrochemistries with advanced manufacturing methods. These compatibilities need to be addressed. Then after feasibility is demonstrated we can address energy density and power density issues. Having said this, the development of battery on a chip does not have as its main objective high power and energy density.

The camera should be sensitive in the 860nm wavelength to allow for detection of Near Infrared laser pointers.

Q6 (05/04/2021): Is the goal of the Phase I to characterize potential COTS options and make a recommendation for use?
A: The threshold requirement is a camera that provides high resolution color imagery during the day plus monochrome low light imagery at night (comparable to Image Intensified tubes is desired). The objective is color imagery during the day AND night. In addition, the camera must operate from -40C to +60C, survive storage from -55C to +71C and operate at altitudes up to 20,000ft.

Q7 (05/04/2021): Are there particular specifications or needs that would make a COTS-camera not suitable for this project?
A: The threshold requirement is a camera that provides high resolution color imagery during the day plus monochrome low light imagery at night (comparable to Image Intensified tubes is desired). The objective is color imagery during the day AND night. In addition, the camera must operate from -40C to +60C, survive storage from -55C to +71C and operate at altitudes up to 20,000ft.

Q8 (04/27/2021): What focal plane is being used in the current CTV?
A: That is proprietary.

Q9 (04/26/2021): What are the expected TRL levels for the technical products from Phase 1 and Phase 2?
A: The desired TRL level would be 7, but less mature technologies would be acceptable if they show promise.

Q10 (04/26/2021): How many Phase I awards do you expect?
A: We will not be disclosing this information.

Q11 (04/26/2021): The background section of the solicitation mentioned âThe camera will be designed to replace the CTV assembly in the Modernized TV Sensor (M-TVS) without requiring modification to the optical system or control electronics.â, is the intent that the form factor and power will be the same, but the optics and electronics associated with the FPA would change?
A: The optical telescope would not change, but changes within the MTVS itself can be made to accommodate the new sensor.

Q12 (04/26/2021): Would the addition of a computation module performing an algorithmic enhancement mode during low light operations be responsive to the topic?
A: Yes

Q13 (04/19/2021): 1) Are there particular specifications or needs that would make a COTS-camera not suitable for this project? 
2) Is the end goal of Phase I to characterize potential COTS options and make a recommendation or modification to existing technology, or recommend fabrication of a custom solution?
3) Is the end goal of Phase II to have a modified COTS solution or to fabricate a custom solution?
4) Are there any specific dynamic range/full well or sensitivity requirements for this use-case?
5) Are there requirements for performance in near-infrared (NIR) or for specific lasers? 
6) Are there any specific requirements for optical format? What would be the minimum and maximum desired pixel pitch? What is the desired optical system focal length?
7) Are there any details specific to the Apache FLIR system that would be useful to inform the proposed LLL imager?

A: This topic closed for new questions on 4 May 2021.

Q5 (05/11/2021): Can the firing port be closed or covered to reduce loss of cooling or heating while the chamber achieves temperature?
A: This topic closed for new questions on 4 May 2021.

Q6 (04/29/2021): What is the maximum number of pages for the project narrative, not including the cover sheet?

What is the smallest font size that can be used?
A: Please refer to the overarching 21.4 BAA, Appendix A for Phase I proposal instructions. Font size should be no smaller than 10 point font. Technical Volume should not exceed 5 pages, and the 2-page Commercialization Strategy will not count against those 5 pages.

Q7 (04/28/2021): Is make-up water available for humidification?
A: There will not be a water source available on site. The solution would require self-contained water supply.

Q8 (04/28/2021): The specified dimensions of 15 ft. x 15 ft. seems large for a single weapon.  Are these set in stone or would something around 8.5 ft. wide be acceptable?
A: <font color=""#000000"">The specified dimensions are based on existing setup. The space will accommodate one weapon system with mount, four operators and instrumentation. The weapon system and instrumentation platforms will be approximately 2 x 4-ft EACH. The weapon system mount will be bolted to floor.&nbsp; The goal behind increasing the width to 15-ft was to potentially (if HVAC capacity permitted) adapt a larger weapon (e.g. 30-mm) that may have recoil. If the specified dimensions are not practical, we are open to alternatives.</font>

Q9 (04/28/2021): Is it important that the air around the weapon is maintained at the specified temperatures or that the weapon itself is at that temperature?  Or both?
A: Both. The weapon will need to be at the specified temperature. For extreme temperatures, the weapon will be conditioned for an extended period (e.g. one day) prior to testing to ensure it reaches desired temperature. After the test starts, air surrounding the weapon will need to be maintained at the desired set point to ensure weapons remains at temperature.

Q10 (04/28/2021): The temperature range of interest is considerable.  What are the associated ambient conditions?  In other words, are you trying to test weapons at -60 deg. F in Afghanistan or Siberia?
A: Weapons are conditioned in accordance with MIL-STD-810H. The MIL-STD provides guidance on test conditions based on anticipated deployment conditions of test item. The solution for this SBIR must be able to accommodate the entire temperature / humidity ranges as specified in the MIL-STD.

Q11 (04/28/2021): Could you provide us with information regarding the capacity of the current system across the specified temperature range?
A: For manned firing, operators will wear appropriate PPE and follow strict exposure limits (e.g. 20 minutes firing, 1-2 hours recovering). There is also a remote firing capability, but it adds significant time to testing so manned is often preferred. In both scenarios, operators / engineers are frequently in the chamber inspecting and manipulating the weapon. Exposure to temp extremes of 160&deg;F will be very rare. Generally max will be 120&deg;F.

Q12 (04/21/2021): We provide customized coatings that weatherize electronics, would our product be a consideration if we're able to coat the motors, electronics to be protected against humidity, dust to increase the reliability and durability of equipment with significant reduction to downtime.
A: Our current system is NOT portable, so it would not be beneficial with regards to the scope of this SBIR. While moisture and dust definitely reduce equipment durability, the majority of equipment failures are likely more due to sheer volume of make-up air required. That said, these coatings may be of interest to someone looking to develop a new HVACR package to support this concept.

Q13 (04/08/2021): Is the weapon system in a fixture and secured to the floor during testing?
Does the weapon system launch a projectile from inside the camber to outside the chamber?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Yes. ATC has custom gun mounts that are bolted to the floor during testing. The weapon system does fire from inside to outside the chamber, with the muzzle generally being situated near the firing port. </font></font>

Q14 (04/06/2021): Do you want the whole 15'x15'x10' space to one space or can we create an isolation between the operator and the weapon?
A: <font color=""#000000"">There can be an isolation between the operator and the weapon. However, the test apparatus must facilitate EASY access to the weapon for the operators / engineers to inspect and / or manipulate the weapon, etc. without significant temperature loss /gain over the course of several inspections (i.e. four per hour).</font>

Q15 (04/06/2021): Do you have details on the types of weapons to be tested and if so what are the characteristics of the live fire ports?  Are the ports vertical, angular and horizontal and how many ports?  Do you have examples of existing units?
A: <font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Pistols to crew service: M9, M1911, M17, M203, M320, XM25, M4, M16, M110, M2010, M249, M240, Mk19, M2. Not all inclusive list, but majority.</font></font>

<font color=""#000000"">Current firing port is adjustable, rectangular, vertical, floor-to-ceiling, approx. 12-in wide. There are two ports, one for weapon and one for instrumentation. We do not have anything approved for release at this moment. Would be able to provide more info as project progresses.</font>

Q16 (04/06/2021): When the interior temperature is in the 120Â°F to 160Â°F range will the operators of the weapons be in isolation suits or is there an auto-fire arrangement?
A: <font color=""#000000"">ATC utilizes both scenarios. For manned firing, operators will wear appropriate PPE and follow strict exposure limits (e.g. 20 minutes firing, 1-2 hours recovering). There is also a remote firing capability, but it adds significant time to testing so manned is often preferred. In both scenarios, operators / engineers are frequently in the chamber inspecting and manipulating the weapon. Exposure to temp extremes of 160&deg;F will be very rare. Generally max will be 120&deg;F. </font>

Q17 (04/06/2021): An interior space that is no less than 15 x 15 x 10-ft is specified. Is there a specific reason for this minimum size requirement? Based on the other requirements, will this space only need to accommodate one man portable weapon system and 4 system operators? Can you provide a maximum size specification for the man portable weapon system? If it is possible to accommodate the max size weapon system and 4 operators under the specified conditions are you open to alternative minimum dimensions of the interior space? Example: 20' x 10' x 10'.
A: <font color=""#000000"">The specified dimensions are based on existing setup. The space will accommodate one weapon system with mount, four operators and instrumentation. The weapon system and instrumentation platforms will be approximately 2 x 4-ft EACH. The weapon system mount will be bolted to floor.&nbsp; The goal behind increasing the width to 15-ft was to potentially (if HVAC capacity permitted) adapt a larger weapon (e.g. 30-mm) that may have recoil.

Specifically, test items are subjected to temperature extremes of -60 to +160&deg;F and humidity ranges of 0 to 100% Relative Humidity (RH) while being operated at maximum capacity. These weapon systems are generally manually operated and are frequently serviced in the conditioned test space by engineers, technicians, and other test personnel.Controlling the environment to be able to conduct tests in such extremes is inherently challenging and is often exacerbated by local climate conditions. For example, maintaining an extremely cold test chamber with low humidity would be difficult in a region with naturally high temperatures and high humidity. Further complicating the environmental control is the fact that weapon systems emit toxic fumes from the burning of the ammunition's propellant. Without appropriate mitigation, the test space becomes inhospitable to weapon system operators and other test personnel. Consequently, a significant percentage of fresh makeup air is required.To combat these challenges, robust HVACR (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration) systems are required. Aside from the initial and ongoing maintenance/repair costs, these systems are not especially practical or reliable. These HVACR units and chambers are limited in number and generally fixed in their position. This has proven inadequate for current weapons testing demand as it has created scheduling conflicts and delays while also limiting the mobility of testing across ranges. The testing issues are further compounded by the fact that temperature/humidity extremes are difficult to achieve and maintain because of the large volume of fresh makeup air required to maintain safe Carbon Monoxide levels.The focus of this effort is to develop a solution that facilitates mobile testing of man-portable weapon systems in conditioned environments. As such, the following requirements apply:The system shall be fully portable to allow for quick and easy movement between ranges, incorporating modular design features where applicable. For example, a complete chamber system with large HVACR unit may be fully contained and fixed on trailer or may be designed for operators to disassemble within four (4) hours using basic hand tools in the field to load components onto a trailer using a forkliftSystem shall create testing environment with safe operating levels of toxic fumes present in accordance with all relevant occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations for up to four (4) system operators without use of supplied air system or other lifeline while firing one (1) weapon as described below:Temp conditioning of weapon and all ancillary equipment from -60 to +160&deg;FHumidity conditioning of weapon and all ancillary equipment from 0 to 100% RHSystem shall accommodate additional instrumentation (e.g. thermocouples, pressure sensors, etc.) fitted to the weapon system for data acquisition and allow for easy access to that instrumentation by test personnel.

10. What does the Government mean by &acirc;ÂÂpredict expected RF environment behavior? <font color=""#000000"">Predicting RF behavior is a form analyzing Rf environment according to RF tracking history and having an automated sense of how the environment is expected to look and what emitters are expected to keep appearing.&nbsp; Machine learning is a common tool used for these scenarios.</font>

11. What does the Government mean by &acirc;ÂÂvalidate RF test events? <font color=""#000000"">Validation refers to proving the RF behavior of the BEAGLE system during test events.&nbsp; WSTC range monitors and controls allowed RF behavior; BEAGLE system will be validated by reaffirming the behavior of cooperative know emitters during an schedule test.</font>

A: Yes. Those who are selected/awarded for Phase I and Phase II would receive handheld data which consequently are able to generate their own digitized map. None of the handheld detectors will be necessary nor offered as GFI, only their data will be provided. However, for the sake of familiarization, contractors can arrange a visit during the data collection sessions to observe. With limited funding and time, it is expected that contractors would collaborate work in Phase II and beyond with the Government.

Q2 (05/04/2021): What is the format of the data required for the threat map, and what data should be displayed in IVAS and ATAK?
A: Data of emplaced targets are those of the GPS&rsquo;s coordinates -Eastings and Northings or UTMs.

Q3 (05/03/2021): Would the automatic detection, alert, and visual display of hand held detector operator clearance errors, and the visual display of cleared areas (lanes) be of value in this effort?
A: &nbsp;Visual aid is helpful; however, not necessarily required to support the effort. While displaying the digitized map, information would be displayed anyhow. Visual aid is not an instrumental part of detection.

Q4 (05/03/2021): Is the capability and scope limited to supporting the AN/PSS-14C and NXGNHH hand-held detectors (HHD) only, or must it be interoperable with other HHDs in DoD use?
A: The primary focus of this effort is on the NXGN HH as the primary, lead sensor. The goals are to aim for future capabilities of the Army. With limited funding and time, it is expected that the scope of this effort is limited to only NXGN HH. Any other handheld candidates&rsquo; future inclusion would rather be a simple extension if necessary.

Q5 (05/03/2021): Is the algorithm to output a binary threat/no threat decision? Or in the case of a threat, must it classify the type of threat?  What level of error is acceptable?  Is there a target accuracy or precision / recall  value for the algorithm?
A: The output from the detection system required would be only the detection (declaration of target); no anomalies are required to report nor anything in between. However, the FAR is limited to 0.25/sq meter. A training set of data with ground truth will be provided. Other sets of data will be those of blind data sets from which contractors are required to demonstrate the effectiveness of their mine detection algorithm and their approaches. The Government will conduct evaluations of their submittals.

Q6 (05/03/2021): How will the artificial intelligence or advanced algorithm for threat analysis / identification be evaluated?
A: Contractors would need to demonstrate that whether detection algorithm including AI components render the required target detection at Pd greater than 95% and FAR 0.25/sq meter.&nbsp;The output from the detection system required would be only the detection (declaration of target); no anomalies are required to report nor anything in between. However, the FAR is limited to 0.25/sq meter. A training set of data with ground truth will be provided. Other sets of data will be those of blind data sets from which contractors are required to demonstrate the effectiveness of their mine detection algorithm and their approaches.
