One of the commonly used electronic assembly methods in industry is component insertion. A second automated process involves component part retrieval from a storage carousel (AS/RS) for the purpose of kitting parts necessary for subsequent automated PCB assemblies. Kitting is advantageous for small batch size- high diverse part mix assemblies; whereas, magazines are used for production-line oriented work. There are three primary considerations required for optimizing the scheduling of component insertions: (1) the assignment of components to the feeder magazines or kits (i.e., component assignments), (2) the determination of insertion sequence on the board (i.e., table tour), and (3) the determination of the retrieval sequence (i.e., magazine feeder sequence). A second set of optimal insertion sequence needs to be devised for a kitted set of component parts which would be more applicable to the Navy’s Rapid Acquisition of Manufactured Parts (RAMP) Program. The purpose of this project is the development an expert system that optimizes the placement and insertion sequence of electronic part components for a circuit card assembly using kitted parts. An interface would be developed with vendor driven numeric control (NC) codes. Consideration for this system would include the type of insertion/assembly method (i.e., kitted parts use), type and size of a component part (e.g., DIP, axial, radial, straight pin, surface mount, etc.), and type of board (e.g., single or double sided, lead through devices or surface mounted devices or both).

That means that they will not act as antenna’s for the transmission nor for the reception of electronic interference due to electrical or electromagnetic signals in the environment. These electromagnetic signals are due to deliberate transmissions (jamming), natural electrical disturbance (lighting, static electricity, sun spot activity and the like) or nuclear generated electromagnetic pulse. This feature of the optical fiber makes it an important area of investigation for military aircraft communications data bus use. It is particularly important where the bus is exposed to the environment such as an interface to a weapon external to the aircraft fuselage. The use of composites has extended the vulnerability of wire data busses to within the aircraft. MIL-STD-1760A has set aside only two connector cavities for use by fiber optic (FO) interfacing. No work has been done to determine how a fully fiber optic interface can be developed using only two cables to perform those functions required by a MIL-STD-1760 interface. The standard establishes the requirements for multiple functions to occur concurrently. These functions include release consent address lines, high bandwidth lines on which both analogue and high speed digital signals may be required to exist concurrently, and interlock. An interesting problem arises if it is desired to make the fiber line capable of carrying the motor start or release pulse. This energy currently is in the order of 100 watts for 10 milliseconds or 0.1 joules. Typically, an SMS for fighter aircraft will have nine weapons stations on the bus. This would require isolation of the optical receivers and transmitters on the bus from the high energy pulses defined above. This will require a device analogous to a radar T/R tube. Responses to this topic can take the form of 1) Identify those items which need to be developed to make a viable FO weapons interface system or 2) identification of a single critical item for development, generating a plan for the needed research to develop that item and sufficient laboratory work to verify the approach is viable.

Such a system shall also be used to support automatic acquisition and plotting of navigational aids and for purposes of collision avoidance on both conventional and autonomous surface vessels and robotic vehicles. Existing laser-based time-of-flight ranging systems consist of very narrow field of view optical receivers operating in conjunction with laser transmitters of even narrower illumination beam-width. While high angular resolution is thus achieved, mechanical scanning (usually employing rotating mirrors) is required to gather data over extended fields-of-view. Such systems are inherently slow, fragile, and prone to calibration errors. The many laser pulse transmissions necessary to raster scan the entire scene of interest increase probability of detection by enemy sensors. Since overall scan time is relatively long, system response is insufficient for weapons directing. In addition, the 3-D data so gathered is inherently distorted by sensor platform and/or target motion over the period of acquisition, necessitating computationally extensive coordinate transformations for restoration. Performance degrades rapidly as well in the presence of atmospheric obscurants such as fog and haze. Accordingly, an innovative and robust means of gathering high resolution optical 3-D data from a scene about the region of interest is needed for use on conventional and autonomous surface platforms and robotic vehicles, with the inherent ability to discriminate against background and foreground clutter.

DESCRIPTION:: There is a need to establish the quality of tactical data presented to the decision maker in order to: 1) reduce the date overload problem resulting from multiple target, multiple sensor tracking, 2) reduce the need to transmit large volumes of data over limited bandwidth circuits, and 3) enable time-critical decisions to be made in a timely manner. A metric for determining data quality would be useful for screening available information so that only pertinent data that are immediately at hand are presented to the decision maker. The quality of tactical data should reflect the following features: Source:Where did the data originate? Latency: How old is the data? Is it overtaken by events? Priority: Is the data sufficiently important to present for the decision at hand? Relevance: Is the data relevant to the decision at hand? Validation: Does the data require confirmation from independent sources? Security: What is the security level of the data?

Ignition of uncoated boron particles in inhibited by the formation of a boron oxide layer which places a physical barrier between the metal and the oxidizer. It is postulated that two-stage ignition occurs with boron, because the rate of oxidization is slowed by the oxide formation, with subsequent evaporation of the oxide layer and reheating. Coating boron particles will permit the coating metal to react first, which may provide the heat necessary to raise the temperature of the underlying boron above the boron oxide volatilization temperature; therefore, it is important to obtain uniformity and quality of coating while also maintaining a thin coating. The need for pure, dense, spherical and small-size particles (diameters less than 5 microns) is also important, and it is known that impurities in boron reduce volumetric heat release. Phase I research should address the technology of depositing thin (micron or less) reactive magnesium and aluminum coatings onto pure boron particles including and understanding of the preferential coating process, particle size effects, metal coating concentration effects and temperature effects on the rate of coating and thickness. Preliminary experiments should be set up to measure reaction rates of coated particles with air and water vapor.

The system should be able to input a variety of parameters (such as, but not limited to, length of service, pay grade, demographic group and time remaining on contract) and predict, for each individual the probability of attriting within a year and/or failing to reenlist at the end of a contract. Much of the research would be geared toward identifying the variables, which have an impact on the reenlistment decision and it is anticipated that reduced time for processing and analysis with a neural network approach will allow the trial of many data sets to prioritize the use of different variables in this type of forecasting. Once successful with individual forecasting, the system should be usable for analyzing the entire Marine Corps structure to provide aggregate loss forecasts.",300,1941,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65763/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65763/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:52:27,,,,,N90-034_65763,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_N90-034,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:01.939444+00

These formats typically use an antibody which is immobilized to a porous membrane to trap the antigen, while an antibody conjugated to an indicator molecule (enzyme, dye, etc.) is used to visualize the reaction. This type of system could be used as a field detection/identification kit for pathogens or toxins in environmental samples. Attempts at such a device were made through the Identification System, Biological Agent, Rapid, Field (DSBARF) Program initiated by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command during the mid 1980’s; however, this program failed to yield a fielded product. A new approach has been taken by MRDC, whereby commercially available technology will be utilized for medical diagnostic tests and not for environmental field samples. This project will help to fill the void for environmental samples. These kits can be readily developed for reconnaissance and hazardous area demarcation and as a means of identifying samples in the forward area. The kits could be integrated into the forward area NBC laboratory program, which has been initiated by the Marine Corps. This project has a high probability of success. There are already several commercially available test kits for pathogens available to the chemical diagnostic market. These products have undergone rigorous screening by the Food and Drug Administration for safety and efficacy. It is only necessary to evaluate them for agents, which are of interest to the Marine Corps and other military services.

Simultaneous focusing in three planes is impossible and must be supplanted by scan focusing in each of the three planes in rapid succession – a task that requires a young eye and substantial training. Telescopic sights (scopes) are optical instruments which solve this problem by making the target and the aiming reference coincide with the plane of the shooter’s retina. A precise complex achieves this, and relatively fragile system of lenses, reticles and adjustment controls mounted in a fairly large tube. Emerging fiber optic (FO) technology involving monolithic bundles of multiple fiber optic cables (FOC) extruded to variable diameter permits image magnification without the use of lenses. Further, it permits off-axis viewing by bending the FOC conduits without the use of prisms and mirrors; end permits erecting an inverted image by twisting the FOC bundle, without the use of erector lenses. This approach should make it feasible to design a simple, tough, inexpensive sight consisting of just one lens, a monolithic FOC bundle of appropriate shape, and a housing. This sight could have all the performance advantages of a telescopic sight and the cost/durability advantages of iron sights. Phase I will develop engineering calculations and drawings for the FO weapons sight and will fabricate six test items that will be mounted on the M16A2 rifle. This design will ensure interface compatibility with the rifle and a ballistic match with the M855 5.56 mm service ammunition. Phase I will test a representative shooting regime to gather data pertinent to feasibility assessment.

Stand-alone system, interoperability issues and adverse programming actions are a few of the reasons giving rise to these deliberations. The Navy is presently examining a top-down approach to R7D and acquisition decisions, guided by Top Level Warfare Requirements (TLWRs). The Warfare Systems Architectures focus on TLWR compliance. Rigorous mission analysis, force level perspectives and systems architectures are the end products. They address 12 warfare mission areas; Command (communications), C***, Strike Warfare (SW), Anti-Surface Warfare (ASUW), Mine Warfare (MIW), Electronic Warfare (EW), Special Warfare (SW), Amphibious Warfare (AMW), Anti-Air Warfare (AAW), Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW), Space, and Logistics. The force structures to implement these warfare missions include the Carrier Battle Force (CVBF), Battleship Battle Group (BBBG), Amphibious Task Force (ATF), Area ASW Force and SLOC Protection Force. The architectural process involves four steps. 1. Functional decomposition of the mission which entails decomposing the mission into tiers, establishing Required Operational Function (ROF), devising flow diagrams and building a complete data base. 2. Physical analysis of the current force, e.g., complete understanding of the platforms, systems architecture, establishing functional shortfalls of the baseline architecture and adding Fiscal Year Development Plan programs. 3. Identifies shortfall resolutions, such as systems upgrades, notional platforms, etc. This step is reiterated and refined. 4. Architecture Options, which establish WSA&E products such as Force Level Architectures and TLWR compliant options (costs, performance, schedule, risk, technology, payoff). Proposals for innovative systems architectures should address a single mission area; multiple proposals are acceptable. Phase I should focus on architecture and a means to show feasibility of the architecture relative to the four steps of the architectural process discussed above. Phase II will involve continued analysis (via the 4 step process) to begin realization of the architecture(s).",297,2185,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66715/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66715/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:52:33,,,,,N90-049_66715,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_N90-049,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:01.939444+00

If successful, mission training, mission rehearsal and mission review would be accessible to many more people, on smaller simulator systems, for greater lengths of time, at a reduced cost.","The use of visual simulators during training, mission rehearsal, and post mission debriefing can greatly increase aircrew performance and mission effectiveness. The size and cost of current simulation systems, however, makes the proliferation and tactical deployment of simulators infeasible. A low cost, small footprint simulation system is needed to support tactical operations. The purpose of this effort is to develop such a system by utilizing recent advances in parallel processing hardware to attain performance/cost improvements. The system will be a desktop simulator capable of real time generation of visual, infrared, and radar scenes of terrain, cartographic and man made features. A parallel architecture is envisioned using commercially available processing elements. Key design problems include defining an optimal processor topology, interfacing the processor to high speed disk subsystems, and interfacing the processor to display memory. Another major design hurdle will be the development of a small display device capable of providing the level of realism necessary to support successful mission simulation, while at the same time not sacrificing portability and ease of use. The possible inclusion of innovative display concepts, like helmet mounted displays and fiber optic bundles, should be possible targets for evaluation. Phase I work will involve the identification of the necessary hardware and software components for this simulator, as well as defining the operational requirements for the prototype system. Phase II will involve the creation of an advanced development prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the simulator system.

These modulations can take a variety of forms. From an electronic warfare point of view, a very difficult modulation is one which appears random, such as pseudo noise sequence of phase reversals of the carrier frequency. The effect of this radar transmission format is a low peak power compared to traditional pulsed radar signals, broad band across which the power is spread, and a signal format which has no obvious identification characteristics. Used in missile seeker radars, these transmissions cannot be detected by current tactical EW systems such as super heterodyne, IFM or channelizer receivers. An architecture for a realizable EW receiving system which will reliably intercept modulated and other low power, wideband radar signals is needed. The system must be capable of instantaneous bandwidths of 10 to 20% of the carrier frequency, of detection of signal levels well below the noise power level of the signal bandwidth and must be able to test for known modulations of high priority and threat signals. The system must simultaneously retain the sensitivity and selectivity of current EW systems against traditional pulsed radars, be capable of intercept of frequency diversity radars such as pulse to pulse frequency hopping and FM on pulse and must be capable of extremely high sensitivities against threat signals whose parameters are precisely know. The system must be capable of reconfiguration to meet varying search and signal bandwidth requirements and must be programmable to intercept new signals as they emerge.

Demonstration of the feasibility such a device would lead to flight evaluation and eventual incorporation into fleet aircraft such as F/A-18 that currently experience problems, including structural fatigue, due to buffet.","Tactical aircraft maneuvering at high angles of attack induce the formation of unsteady and vortex flows that, in turn, excite the aft aerodynamic surfaces of the aircraft, causing the vibrations known as buffet. Contemporary fighter aircraft such as F-14, F-15, and F-18 have all been subject to destructive vibrations of their twin vertical tails. Control considerations dictate that this type of configuration is likely to remain in flavor; that is, the source of the excitations will probably not go away. Therefore, the surfaces will have to be designed to survive in their environment. As an alternative to beefing up the structure to withstand the vibratory stresses, the application of vibration absorber technology is suggested. Vibration absorbers typically consist of a spring mass system with a natural frequency that corresponds to the unwanted excitation. In this case, the excitation is broad band, and significant responses are at the natural frequencies of the structure.

Aircraft produced under the ATA, ATF and LHX programs will also benefit from such signal enhancements.",Active as well as passive sensor fusion is constrained by the quality of received signals. The purpose of this project is to improve the quality of received signals by introducing a digital filter which extracts additional features. The additional features increase the resolution of subsequent analysis. The digital filtering technique is applied to individual sensors before fusion takes place. Under such conditions the differences between two or more sensors detecting the same event assumes great tactical importance. A new level of tactical interpretation is thought to be possible. Phase I should demonstrate the power of digital filtering to extract additional features from actual data received by tactical sensors. Phase II extend the techniques developed under Phase I to as many sensors as possible. The initial signals studied under Phase I are Radar Frequencies.

These antenna structures, such as employed in the SIDEARM I Missile, have inherent limitations in terms of the frequency band over which their antenna patterns provide useful guidance, the instantaneous field of view within which reliable guidance is available and the rate at which guidance data are generated. Solutions to these problems have been found in complex multiple channel monopulse systems, which have wide bandwidths, wide fields of view, and the ability to develop angle of arrival information on every pulse. Relative to monopulse systems the mechanically scanning systems have a number of virtues, however, because of the simplicity of their single channel receiver design, and the fact that they are currently in the military inventory because they perform well. Techniques are needed to enhance the capabilities of single channel SPW seekers with mechanical angular scan. The current 1.5:1 frequency band must be extended to 3:1, the field of view in which reliable guidance is developed must be extended by a factor of two and methods must be found so reliable guidance information can be generated on intermittent signals and in signal environments in which more than one signal are within the seeker receiver pass band. The antenna enhancement techniques must be capable of implementation as simple modifications to the existing feed and antenna structures and must be mounted on the existing mechanical scan assemblies. The guidance modifications may be implemented in commercially available digital processors suitable for an airborne missile environment, but must be capable of mounting within the physical envelope of the existing SPW guidance circuitry.

Use AN/SQQ-89 ASW Combat System as test bed. The proposed end product would be a system supporting ECP preparation and a process for applying the system to Navy projects.,"MIL-STD-480B is a complicated process used to control changes to Navy equipments and software. Often, project managers tailor away the control that 480B attempts to impart to the change process in order to simplify and minimize impact on their day-to-day operation. Rather than simplifying the task by a redefinition of the ECP requirements, the Navy should provide tools that allow easy compliance with all 480B requirements. The proposed research would prototype a system that would provide on line help for identifying the requirements for each ECP block. Additionally, an Expert System would be developed based on knowledge about the project under control, and would provide logical alternatives for information to be included in each ECP block. Ultimately the intent would be to tie the ECP CASE TOOL to the CM database(s) and a ""function matrix” in an attempt to predict change impact through all documentation. For the first phase, plan to demonstrate interactive production of ECP forms, select a MAC II with 2 page monochrome display, mouse and laser printer as the basic engine. The system would be designed within the HYPERCARD paradigm (using Super Card or its predecessors). A help file would be generated and a ""help” interface developed for the interactive ECP forms. Certain critical blocks within the ECP would be singled out to demonstrate the functioning of a simple expert system for Phase II. Rules and relationships would need to be identified and incorporated within the HYPERCARD context. Alternatives would be presented in windows adjacent to the online ECP form and selection of an alternative would be via the mouse point-n-click capability. The Expert System would be focused on identifying logical alternatives for the selected ECP block based on previously entered information and the knowledge of the AN/SQQ-89 (or other) system. The system would be able to learn new alternatives through a common usage algorithm. The proposed expert system should be considered in the context of an assistant or mentor.

The forthcoming version D of MIL-STD-1472C is also deficient in this area. As a result, current separations and dimensions are being specified by individual system designers without the benefit of detailed research and documented studies. While this information has DOD-wide application, specific needs exist for this information relative to the Navy (e.g. sea state and shipboard vibration). Questions have arisen whether the limited amount of screen display area has been efficiently utilized by the designers of systems for the Navy. The operator of a Touch-Sensitive Screen should have a screen which compensates for these conditions. In addition, when the key field dimensions and key field separations are too large, the overall screen design is inefficient and underutilized. If the key field dimensions and key field separators are too small, an incorrect entry or inadvertent action may be made. AN incorrect entry may cause severe problems, especially if he operator is controlling a fire control system. Currently, without formalized design guidelines, recommendations, or standards for utilization by system designers, the overall design is configured without consistency.

Conventional nuclear theory indicates that fusion is possible only at very high temperature, and that neutron production should be much higher than is observed. On the other hand, the observed heat output appears to be large to arise from known chemical reactions at room temperature. Measurements of neutrons by different researchers continue to indicate that nuclear processes may be occurring in the palladium crystal lattice. That nuclear processes may not be ruled out on the basis of ""conventional wisdom” finds historical precedence in earlier predications that muon-catalyzed fusion (MCF) of two deuterium nuclei would be improbable, and the mCF would be of little interest. Recent studies continue to show, however, that much higher rates occur for MCF of deuterium and tritium. In the same way, new nuclear reactions involving lithium may be important in the crystal lattice. It is interesting to note in this regard that Fleischmann and Pons have stressed the importance of using electrolytes containing the lithium and of employing carefully molded cathodes with the proper crystal structure. The Phase I effort would involve the development of a quantum statistical mechanical theory of nuclear fusion among lithium and deuterium nuclei inside the palladium lattice. Since experiments show saturation of the electrode by deuterium to be essential, the theory would need to show the importance of coupling of the reaction of the nuclei to the entire lattice. The Phase II effort would involve calculations of rates as functions of electrochemical potential in order to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion of deuterium and lithium as a source of propulsion in torpedoes.",291,1878,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65255/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65255/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:53:33,,,,,N90-207_65255,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_N90-207,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:02.392673+00

In the case of TACIT RAINBOW, part of the warranty for missile integrity is to maintain the container sealed until intent for deployment. TO allow an electrical integrity test of TACIT RAINBOW without opening the container, the containerized weapon has an electrical cable connected to the missile umbilical, with the other end of the cable attached to an external connector on the container. This allows running an electrical built-in-test of the weapon without opening the storage container.

The use of these materials necessitates significant constraints in design and production techniques due to significant thermal mechanical differences between the ceramic and other structural components of the missile. Current methods of joining such materials to the structural components of the missile system rely on adhesive or polymeric joining techniques. There is a need for unique joining/bonding processes that can directly join ceramic IR and RF dome components, 2 inches to 13 inches in diameter, to cylindrical metal surfaces. Performance requirements dictate that the joining process should produce hermetic joints which can withstand an environment of 550 C for a minute or more and up to 150 cycles form –40 to 200 C. Exposure to the high temperatures associated with conventional brazing processes can degrade the optical merit of materials like ZnS and promote chemical reaction. It is therefore desirable to utilize a highly localized heat source for the joining effort. Laser brazing is a promising joining technique which is capable of providing the heat necessary for a metallurgical bond. The heat provided by the laser is localized, thus limiting thermal degradation to regions adjacent to the joint. Residual stresses due to thermal expansion of the entire component during assembly are also avoided. Process development for a ceramic to metal joining method which takes advantage of the highly localized heating offered by a laser source would be most desirable.",247,1608,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/69862/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/69862/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,90.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:53:42,,,,,N90-230_69862,DOD_SBIR_90_P1_C1_N90-230,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:02.888382+00

In order to understand this disruption process, characteristics of the small particulates must be known. The parameters that are critical are the mass density, drag coefficient and alignment to the flow of the living organism as it traverses a boundary layer. The living characteristics are required because upon death, the particles rapidly deteriorate and the resulting characterization becomes meaningless.

Such a process will be used to protect expensive marine propulsion hardware, currently under development, which require very high efficiency heat transfer.","The Navy has a need for a protective coating for aluminum alloys which is extremely hard, and has very good abrasion resistance, corrosion resistance, and thermal conductivity. Anodized aluminum coatings have been used for years to protect Navy equipment from the effects of corrosion and abrasion. The thermal conductivity of typical commercial anodic coatings has been found to be very low. Developmental marine propulsion systems require very high efficiency heat transfer from the condensing section to seawater. An improved thick anodic coating or other coating of inert material is required for protection against an abrasive and corrosive marine environment. The coating must provide protection against the effects of abrasion and corrosion equal to or greater than that of commercial hard anodic coatings, but have a thermal resistance per unit area significantly less than that of a 2 milli inch, thick hard anodic coating. A reduction in thermal resistance per unit area of at least a factor of 3 is desired. The coating must be inert or non metallic in order to avoid electrolytic corrosion effects between dissimilar metals in a saltwater environment. Also, the coating must provide corrosion protection equivalent to a typical 2 milli inch thick commercial anodic coating, sealed using a standard hydration technique. The temperature of the aluminum part to be coated must remain low enough during the coating process that the wrought aluminum alloy does not lose its temper. Ultimately, the process must be capable of coating an aluminum surface area of several hundred square inches. In Phase I preliminary tests will be performed to demonstrate a process that will have the potential of satisfying the above requirements regarding thermal transfer and abrasion resistance.

Advanced voice messaging and response systems optimized for naval operations would improve operational efficiency measurably. These systems can include many difference features which can be incorporated in many different ways. Which features to include and how to implement them, on what hardware, using which software, with what security features, are questions that need to be answered before a system can be designed built, evaluated, and installed. The major features of these systems are described along with some of the problems they address. When an immediate response is not required, the ability to leave a recorded message eliminates the sender’s waiting time and frees up the lines for the messages requiring immediate response. Also messages can be composed off line and then sent at a rapid rate which serves to relive congestion on the lines. Auto attendants can reduce the time and personnel required to make connections. Intelligent routing can send a single message to many people, thus eliminating the time and effort for repeat calls. Personal assistants for secondary call answering can provide call transfer, verbal alert to secondary person that transfer call is coming in, notification to caller that transfer is occurring, and voice messaging on command if needed. Remote pagers can alert and inform the intended receiver when away form the workstation, reducing time to make contact and eliminating search efforts. Scratchpad capability permits the caller or receiver to record parts of the conversation for recall. Much information requested is database data which can be obtained or entered without a second person in the loop. Interactive mailboxes can be programmed with prerecorded questions to obtain database information in the required format. Voice messages and keypad entries can be combined to optimize interactions, such as sorting messages by coded input, redirecting calls by selecting keypad entry from recorded voice menu, providing priority, entering and receiving database information, and access voice bulletin boards. The Phase I effort should address operational requirements for voice messaging and response and a survey of available hardware/software with small scale testing to evaluate various features.

Designing ships to accommodate large ice loads is unrealistic and ships presently in commission were not designed with the objective of sustained operation in such conditions. Icing will cause impairment of mission and ship operation capability and in the extreme, place personnel safety at risk. State-of-the-art ice phobic coatings have demonstration that it is possible to retard the formation of ice. Undoubtedly these coatings will become more efficient. However, these coatings are parasitic in nature and intrinsically create a maintenance burden. The application requires manpower, renewal is required and their appearance requires that the coatings be removed when the ship is not operating in an icing conducive environment. Modification of marine topcoats to enable them to prevent and/or significantly retard the accretion of ice would significantly contribute to the readiness of all U.S. Navy ships to operate in the northern latitudes without the predeployment and post deployment manpower burden associated with presently available ice phobic coatings. Environmental conditions conducive to severe icing can infrequently develop in lower latitudes. Having a marine top coat with an intrinsic resistance to ice accretion will provide a built in safety margin in unanticipated environmental situations.

The damage in all of these examples is created by small particulates and vapors. Filtration of these materials is beyond the capabilities of conventional shipboard systems. Systems developed recently to address these problems use highly efficient barrier type filters to control particulates and activated carbon to physically absorb vapors. These systems require large amounts of shipboard space and impose increased pressure drop on the ventilation system which as required the development and installation of specialty fans. The filtration performance and useful life of these filter systems are adversely affected by the marine environment. Atomized liquid spray filtration systems address the deficiencies of the current systems. Pressure drop across the liquid spray is low because there is no obstruction to the airflow, thus the system will require less space and can operate with conventional ventilation fans. The pressure drop does not increase with time because there is no buildup of particulate on a filter media; the contamination is carried from the filtration site by the liquid. The condition of the liquid can be monitored and maintained so that filtration efficiency is maintained with time. Filtration efficiency of the spray is not affected by humidity in the marine environment as is in the case with carbon filters. Theory and experiment indicate that high velocity, atomized liquid droplets are required to efficiently filter particulate in the size range of concern. Atomized liquid droplets will also provide the large liquid surface area for vapor absorption which is normally provided by special packing materials in conventional liquid scrubbing towers. Initial efforts should be directed toward identification and development of effective and practical techniques for the generation of high velocity, atomized liquid droplets and evaluation of these techniques for filtration of specific shipboard contaminants.

For example, a small remote aircraft with LIDAR and video camera or an aerostat with a search radar may satisfy imaging of ice and air/ice boundary measurement. An underwater ROV (remotely operated vehicle) with appropriate sensors may solve the ice/ocean boundary quantification needs. The Arctic ice canopy is a collage of floes that are put into motion by winds, water currents, Coriolis force, and ocean dynamic height acting upon them. Under these influence, the ice drag coefficients and strength of the ice canopy determine its stress level and the motion it undergoes until restricted by continental margins. When the ice floes are gridlocked, stresses build up until the strength of the ice sheet is exceeded, resulting in rafting, ridge/keel building, lead formation, and ice canopy distortion. Imaging the ice distortion over time and space while monitoring air/ice and ice/ocean boundary layer deformation and stress build up in the ice canopy would provide researchers with the input/output parameters needed to develop and verify ice dynamics models. The Phase I proposals should provide a concept definition of the instrumentation and identify the components that are critical to developing a feasible design.

The proposed device would enable a remote, non-contact measurement to be taken before machining/grinding is begun. As the part has been measured by contact devices (micrometers, dial indicators, etc.) before machining begins, the original dimension is known, a desired amount of metal will be removed to give the required final dimension, therefore, a change in dimension (delta) is the measurement taken. The metal removal process is then begun and will be able to be located up to three feet from the part and will have a demonstrated measuring accuracy of 0.0002 inch.

The ability to yaw the aircraft in the post stall flight regime implies, intuitively, a significant advantage in adversary engagements. However, for enhanced maneuverability to become an operational requirement this advantage must be quantified and shown to be useful for specific Naval applications. Thus, a methodology for evaluating enhanced maneuverability as demonstrated by the X-31 for potential tactical benefits is needed. Issues that must be addressed for effective transfer of EFM technologies concern basic configuration differences between the X-31 and Naval Tactical Aircraft. For example, carrier based aircraft typically do not have the highly swept wings because of low angle of attack landing requirements.

One airframe problem has been the evaluation of surface residual stresses in both ferrous and nonferrous airframe alloys in a way that can be rapidly and safely applied to aircraft in the field and on board carriers. Although x-ray analysis techniques are a proven, effective and quantitative method for residual stress evaluation, they are difficult to apply in restricted areas and are limited by safety considerations. Recently developed procedures using either ultrasound or magnetic hysteresis have been successfully applied to the determination of residual stresses under favorable conditions. Generally, ultrasound techniques have been limited by textural uncertainties, and magnetic techniques have been only applicable to ferromagnetic alloys.

In order to meet these goals, gas turbine engines must operate at significantly higher temperatures and pressures. Currently used JP-5 fuel (narrow cut kerosene jet fuel) will oxidize prematurely at the elevated temperatures anticipated in the new turbine engines. Additive technology exists that will extend the elevated temperature stability of jet fuel does not stabilize the fuel at the very high inlet temperatures expected. Also, such technology deteriorates other performance properties of the fuel such as water-shedding ability, low temperature characteristics, filterability and ignition quality. An innovative additive development effort is required to address the problem of premature oxidation of the fuel due to the high temperatures expected in future generation gas turbine engines. The additive must be compatible with JP-5 fuel in that it does not degrade the important properties of the fuel. In addition, contaminant pickup from shipboard CuNi aviation fuel systems has been shown to degrade the thermal stability of JP-5 and must be addressed in the development. Phase I efforts should demonstrate the stability enhancing chemistry necessary for high temperature JP-5 performance.

Tacitly with this duty goes there requirement to achieve this goal with a minimum amount of public expenditures. Similarly, problems can be expected in attaining this objective as a result of predictable reduced demands based on budget costs for military industries. Present production models associate reduced demands with increased unit cost, which is true if we assume constant manufacturing technology. However, modern flexible manufacturing technology has demonstrated that quantity reduction and unit cost reduction can go together. Hence, it is justified to assume the possibility of an under-proportional output cost versus budget cut, provided sufficient incentives exist to modernize the manufacturing technology in the military sector of the industrial base. However, manufacturing technology does not exist in a vacuum by itself. It must be seen in its interdisciplinary connectiveness with the economy and legal environment. The intrinsic interwoven aspects of technology, economy and law apply to the wide spectrum from international competitiveness to preparedness and surge. Conceptually, the nature of the problems are the same; only the terminology changes: It is the concern with the well-being of the U.S. Industrial Base.

However, the selected time delay is a trade-off between the many scenarios under which ejections take place. A long time delay before extracting the chute would be disastrous at low altitudes since precious time will be lost. Phase I will research available literature to obtain the accelerative forces and loads produced by the opening of a parachute during a ejection sequence. Based upon known physiological limitations to accelerations in the Gz direction and other limiting factors such as angular velocity changes, a working range will be established for the design of an Energy Absorbing System also call a Load Limiting Device (LLD). Perform preliminary analysis through modeling to establish system design criteria and performance characteristics. Also, conduct feasibility studies for energy attenuation and its location. The contractor will deliver conceptual designs based upon the literature search. In Phase II the LLD will be designed and fabricated to either interface with the seat bucket structure or as part of the parachute risers. A testing program will be conducted to obtain performance data in Phase II.

This display system is to provide true 3D images which would be viewed for air traffic control from any angle.,"3D displays truly offer a port for avionics to communicate a spatial awareness to air traffic controller, or the pilot in all directions. The 3D display approach allows a total spherical world to be generated so that information is conveyed in spatially relevant directions. Volumetric (multiplanar) displays use X, Y, Z, addressable display volume by physically creating multiple planes. They have the advantage that they require neither binocular or sequential presentation, nor the fusing of virtual images. They simply create a volume which is used as a display surface. The ideal volumetric 3D display system would be viewable from all angles, with naked eyes, simultaneously by several viewers. Potential applications are characterized by the need to view real 3D objects in a volume. The users could view the objects from various angles to evaluate the real time 3D position of multiple objects. The most obvious near term applications are: cockpit and crew station display, air traffic control, battle management, weather pattern analysis, medical 3D imaging molecular modeling and remote manipulation. The display system consists of random scan laser beam which is modulated by acousto-optic (AO) modulators and is synchronized with the Z dimension displacement of the rotating helix. The beam is scanned in X and Y, while the synchronization of the modulation with the rotating helix provides the Z dimension.

The Navy/Air Force are presently contracting for the development of higher efficiency and power density power supplies to provide reliable power to very high speed, high density integrated circuit systems. This is necessary due to the excessive size factor which results with the use of the best available commercial low voltage power supplies. Presently available power supplies would exceed the volume of the remainder of the systems; the rule of thumb is for the power supply’s volume not to exceed 25% of the volume of the system. A major problem in power supply packaging and circuit assembly is the presently design-mandated shapes of the magnetic components, i.e. near cubical in shape. Magnetic devices do not lend themselves to easily conform to high density solid planar structures, rather they are commonly built as separate coil/cord structures which, when assembled, are spacewise inefficient and will not easily conform to the printed circuit layout used for the integrated circuits of the system. This nonconformity dictates greater printed circuit card spacing when the power supply aggravates the system volume by the extended low voltage lines and connector interface serial impedances. Additional decoupling and impedance lowering capacitors must be used for operational reliability. Either card spacing must be increased or added components are required in the conventionally approaches outline above. Therefore, low profile, high performance magnetic components are highly valued. Projected use is in the power management for Avionics, E.W. and JIAWG. Phase I: Explore the technical feasibility of low profile, highly efficient magnetic devices outlined in the objective.

A resurgence in the field of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which seeks to emulate the biological information processing methods of the brain offers great promise for increasing the information processing capabilities of present technologies. The capabilities are mainly due to the fact that many ANN models are adaptive in nature; that is, they ""learn” much like real organisms. Beyond the robotic and telerobotic control, knowledge processing and other AI functions, ANNs offer promise as highly efficient analog computers to the solution of previously intractable problems in sensor interception, as encountered in pattern recognition; image (target) matching; associative computer memory and control; radar and sonar signal processing and preprocessing. ANNs are presently in a phase of hardware implementation to achieve the potential of compactness, speed and parallelism for real time applications. Phase I (six month duration) will address: a.

The basic method incorporates using two separate shading functions over a single aperture to obtain directional information for signals arriving at a measurement array. Theoretical work has been published on extending the basic processing scheme to wideband signals (Henderson, 1985). It is proposed that a variant of this method could be useful in analyzing backscattered returns from complex objects in order to localize the significant scattering centers in the object. The use of wideband arrays (PVDF) incorporating geometric shading is currently under investigation (Henderson) and may greatly simplify practical implementation for analysis of signals with arbitrary spectra.

Navy C3I systems must manage land, sea, airborne and space data elements. Driving such systems are significant requirements for maintenance of thousands of objects, discriminating the real threats among them, and tracking them with real time updates. Tactical weapons systems require performance in the highly real-time to critical-time performance envelopes. Autonomous sensor/weapons control systems must deal with an enormous quantity of unfiltered data coming in at very high data rates. Critical to the success of mission critical Navy systems is the ability to manage large (gigabit) databases in a fast, predictable and reliable manner. The demanding mission critical environment will become even more challenging due to a substantial increase in the amount of data to be considered as a result of new sensor systems and communications capabilities, and reduced reaction time resulting from increasingly sophisticated weapons that can minimize detection time.

There are dozens of architectures to choose from, with many available in commercial systems, boards, chip sets, and single-chip systems, with wafer-scale systems coming. Each of these is capable of implementing from one to many processing models. Examples include: SIMD, synchronous, data parallel; MIMD, synchronous or asynchronous, data-flow or control-flow, process- or application-parallel, etc. The user's problem can contain different parallelism. Merely capturing the specification of the application algorithm, which involves selecting an appropriate language, presents hundreds of choices. The user has requirements beyond the algorithmic: throughput, memory usage, result precision, latency, weight, power, size, cost, (NRE, life cycle). The usual reaction to this plethora of choices is to select a hardware solution supported by a friendly vendor, and thereby reduce the solution space dramatically. This is effective, if not optimal, but locks the user into a system that will probably not meet all of his requirements, and will not evolve with technology. The better solution would be a methodology, well supported by expert systems and tools, all of which are maintained current with technology, which can assist the user in finding an optimal mapping of his problem onto a parallel processing system which meets all of his requirements as well as possible. This methodology would support: problem and requirements capture by alternative methods appropriate to the problem/segment, with expert system guidance; reduction of the application to a standard intermediate form; (guided) selection of choices of alternative architectural and execution models to be examined in trades; performance analysis of the application on the chosen models through simulation or emulation; representation of the final solution in a language appropriate to the selected target system; validation of the solution as implemented on the target.

It was designed to particularly address signal processing applications which inherently contain opportunities to improve mission performance through the use of this type of processing The UYS-2 System includes ""compute processors' that are functional elements intended to efficiently execute compute intensive application programs. One such processor is the Floating Point Arithmetic Processor; a second will be the Matrix Processor. Plans call for additional computer processors, optimized to specific applications or classes of applications. A particular configuration of the UYS-2 is tailored to a mission problem. This is partially accomplished by including one or more compute processors, of one or more varieties. That is, for example, a particular configuration might have two FP Arithmetic Processors and three Matrix Processors, because the parallel processing characteristics of the mission problem being addressed and the compute requirement of the mission both need, and can effectively use, these hardware resources. These may be placed into a variety of backplane slots. The UYS-2 System also includes some rather sophisticated programming tools built around the Processing Graph Methodology (PGM) which enable the design of an application system to be done at a high level, expressed in graph notation, and then, mostly automatically, be translated into code strings that are executable within the various functional elements of the UYS-2. However, when one examines the hardware and software design that underlies the PGM level, one finds a structure that is basically designed to support and facilitate hand microcoding. To support a compute processor, such as an FP AP, in the UYS-2, one must develop in hand crafted microcode a set of EMSP Primitives appropriate to support the intended applications on the machine. This is not an instruction set, as one might associate with a conventional Instruction Set Architecture machine, that remains fixed once designed; it changes, at least by extension, for each type of application of interest. When the library of EMSP Primitives (i.e., microcode macros) are developed and in place, then the process of converting PGM graphs to executable code is efficient and mostly automated. For each compute processor that one wishes to incorporate into the UYS-2, one must develop microcode similar to the set needed for the FPAP. There are several problems with this software development methodology as follows: incorporating a new compute processor into the UYS-2 requires the development of an extensive set of microcode. Extending the set of applications to which the UYS-2 is to be applied, and which require the support of new PGM level primitive nodes, will in general require additional microcode macros to be developed to achieve throughput objectives. Unless the set of EMSP Primitives and the I/O operations are equivalent from one compute processor to another, the programs will be different on each process or for the same graph level primitive node. No portability from processor to processor is likely; even if portability is intended and planned, it will be very difficult and costly to verify and control. Each new compute processor incorporated into the UYS-2 requires the development of a relatively large and complex software development support environment, including microassemblers, linkers, simulators, and debugging tools. 5. The UYS-2 system does not take advantage of high level programming languages, particularly Ada, to solve problems of software reusability, rapid development of application systems, and life cycle cost reduction. Further, UYS-2 compute processors (i.e. the FP AP) do not facilitate the use of high level languages; rather, they are designed to meet the need of the hand microcoder to partition the implementation problem into small segments in order for him to understand and be able to cope with the problem. This general partitioning strategy can lead to quite good results on a segment by segment basis, but is often very poor on a global basis. Compilers generally do a better job on large compute problems than do handcoders, due mainly to their ability to evaluate many more opportunities per unit time than the person can and their indifference to the size of the problem being addressed. In summary, the UYS-2 problem of interest herein is to provide software tools that utilize Ada while maintaining the inherent advantages of the present programming environment, and thus gain the advantages inherent in the language, and also greatly reduce the time and cost involved in addressing both new processing elements and new applications. The proposed solution involves the application of the JRS Integrated Design Automation System (IDAS) to provide the Ada to Microcode Compiler and Software Development Tools needed to support current and future compute processors. One of the primary functional capabilities of IDAS is the ability to automatically generate an Ada Compiler and a Simulator for an arbitrary processor described in the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). Using this capability, one could then automatically create the tools with which to evaluate and support the target processor directly from the normal design documentation. Thus, the UYS-2 development tools are all contained within one common environment for all of the processor types. The application code will then be portable in Ada source code form and maintainable, therefore, in Ada, for all the processors. Another major consideration in introducing Ada into the USY -2 is that it makes the connection between the PGM Graphs and the executable code in the compute processors much more natural, direct, and maintainable. The Primitive Graph Nodes already have Ada program representations of their functionality, developed for the PGSE system. Phase I: The first phase will be a system design and planning activity that would result in detailed specifications, design guidelines, and development plans. Phase II: Develop the Ada integrated UYS-2 environment. Phase III: Demonstrate an Ada compiler produced for an arbitrary AN/UYS-2 configuration, and show that it will pass the Ada Validation Suite.",965,6305,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65888/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65888/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:55:23,,,,,N91-106_65888,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C1_N91-106,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:04.0466+00

In short, it is the problem of rapidly constructing a physically realized hardware prototype.","Programmable gate arrays are a component technology that is potentially very useful in solving rapid prototyping problems. The technology provides a programmable hardware element that could be made to represent essentially any arbitrarily complex digital circuit. The individual gate array circuits are VLSI devices and contain several thousand gates each, organized into hundreds of configurable logic blocks. It is a very flexible, potentially useful technology. Recent activities towards the exploitation of this technology have focused on the problem of providing ""arrays of programmable gate arrays""; that is, the focus is on the problem of interconnecting the gate arrays in networks, so that one could map very large digital circuits onto the network. This will eliminate the fairly severe limitations on the utility of the technology, when applied one device at a time, and open the doors to the possibility of processor rapid prototyping. The proposed solution to the processor rapid prototyping problem brings together two technologies in an eminently synergistic manner. The first is the programmable Gate Array (PGA) circuit technology, the second is the IRS Integrated Design Automation System [IDAS) technology. PGA technology is being pursued by constructing large arrays of the devices, that will provide between 500,000 and 100,000 equivalent gates or 10,000 to 20,000 configurable logic blocks, that can be automatically configured to represent complex processors. This size array can be packaged onto one VME size board that plugs directly into the backplane of an appropriate hoot (e.g., SUN). The PGA board can then be driven by the hoot processor; it can be configured by it; it can receive static or dynamic input data from it; and, it can return output data to it, statically or dynamically. The hoot processor provides the environment for testing a prototype, for doing an evaluation of its suitability or comparative effectiveness. The PGA board becomes a hardware simulator/emulator of the target processor; it provides the test bed for testing and evaluating alternatives. The PGA board can then be the actual physical hardware prototype or the configuration data can be transferred to other physical manifestations that might be more useful in a particular system environment. IDAS technology provides the processor synthesis tools and the links to designers working in VHDL that are necessary to effectively utilize the potential of the PGA board in a significant manner. Processor synthesis in IDAS creates processor representations that are implemented in components contained in libraries and are expressible in VHDL. The VHDL description is then processed to generate a software simulator for the implemented processor. One will then be able to use IDAS to synthesize application specific processors, simulate and evaluate them very fast on the VGA Board, and return results to designers. The configured PGA Board, or a translated image of it, could also be used as a physical prototype for actual interconnection to other hardware such as the backplane of the AN/UYS-2.

OCMs operating at high powers require microwave tubes, such as magnetrons, crossed-field amplifiers, or TWTs as the source; TWTs are often the tube of choice for OCMs requiring broad bandwidth in addition to high power. In turn, TWTs require thermonic cathodes as the source of electrons for the power tube beam. OCM TWT must not only be capable of providing the required power-bandwidth performance, but also be able to function quickly after long shelf storage and brusque handling. Recent attention to the use of TWT-based OCMs after long shelf-storage has indicated that the cathode is a key factor in successful OCM use. Accordingly, to achieve a better understanding of cathode properties contributing to more effective OCMs several technical issues must be fully understood. How sensitive to fabrication/processing techniques are the fast-warm-up properties of thermonic emitters? Is one cathode vendor able to produce cathode assembly, better cathode materials, or improved fabrication/processing? After extended shelf life, how sensitive are cathodes to poisoning from gases found in the tube as a result of tube processing or from other sources? Although several recently completed and ongoing studies are contributing to the overall understanding of this problem, an objective evaluation based on sound methodology would contribute to reliable and affordable TWT -based OCMs. Phase I: Would begin with the collection and review of all available data and information on TWT operation after long shelf life storage. The data and information shall derive from the Services, TWT manufacturers and vendors, and cathode manufacturers and vendors. For non-operable TWT, the cause of failure shall be clearly identified; for operable TWTs, cathode type, cathode vendor, cathode turn-on time, measurement technique, and other relevant factors, shall be clearly identified and reported in order to prioritize the susceptibility of TWT cathodes to poisoning or failure after long shelf storage. A ranking of cathode by type, vendor, application, etc. shall be the result of the Phase I effort. Phase II: Would entail a laboratory evaluation of the ranked cathodes from Phase I to identify the major factors associated with cathode fabrication/processing that contribute to long TWT shelf life. The methodology should address the effect of residual gases, such as CO², Cl, H2O, etc., on cathode reactivation times.

For example, RF doppler trackers are susceptible to glint, polarization, multipath, jammers and multiple target confusion. IR trackers are susceptible to hot spot offset (e.g. plume tracking), background clutter, IR decoys, and multiple target confusion. Most of these problems only exist in one tracking regime at a time, e.g., RF multi path does not affect IR tracking, IR background clutter does not affect RF tracking, RF tracking, etc. Even multiple target confusion becomes resolvable. Multiple identical IR target signatures would usually appear as distinctly different RF doppler signatures.

These thermocouples are imbedded in the wall of the model. This method has shortcomings in that the model must be fabricated from specific materials, the number of thermocouples is generally limited (usually less than 50), and there is a constraint on material thickness (measurements could not be made on leading edges). These restrictions limit the number of models that can be readily tested. Experiments indicate that infrared (IR) thermography can be used to make surface temperature measurements of a wind tunnel model. The advantage of IR thermography is that data can be obtained for up to 10 points on the model. The disadvantage is that the model surface emissivity must be known, and is often not easily determined. It is therefore necessary to develop the capability of putting a coating on tunnel models to prepare them for IR thermography testing. This coating should be less than 20 um in thickness and have an emissivity greater than 0.85 for radiation in the 8-12 um wave band.

Ignition of uncoated boron particles is inhibited by the formation of a boron oxide layer which places a physical barrier between the metal and oxidizer. It is postulated that two-stage ignition occurs with boron, because the rate of oxidation is slowed by the oxide formation, with subsequent evaporation of the oxide layer and reheating. Aluminum or magnesium coated boron particles may permit the coating metal to react first, which may provide the heat necessary to raise the temperature of the underlying boron above the boron oxide volatilization temperature; therefore it is of interest to study the combustion of thinly (0.1 to 0.01 micron) coated small (diameters less than 5 microns) boron particles at temperatures up to 2500""K, expansion ratios of up to five to one, and reaction time resolution from milliseconds to microseconds.

It has been suggested that, in order for aluminum to deliver energy in an explosive or propellant, the temperature of the aluminum must be above the boiling point of the oxide coating that protects the surface of an aluminum particle. It is possible that the substitution of a fluoride coating in the production of the aluminum powders to be used in explosive or propellant formulations would lead to more rapid shedding of the protective coating and hence earlier participation of the aluminum in the detonation. If this earlier participation were to occur, it might make it feasible to use aluminized materials in applications that are usually reserved for ideal explosives, thus making higher energy explosives available for metal driving applications.

As this increased amount of data requires transmission to the ground, wider telemetry bandwidths are required. Due to high usage it is increasingly difficult to obtain wide bandwidth allocations.

Fortunately, there is a great deal of redundancy in the Doppler signal generated by the passing projectile which makes such signals natural candidates for various types of data compression techniques. Due to the unique chirp and statistically non-stationary nature of these Doppler signals, conventional data compression techniques will have to be substantially modified to be effective, Compression techniques must be developed to function in the very low signal to noise ratio environment that is characteristic of scoring Doppler signals and through a telemetry channel experiencing frequent data dropouts.

This proposed task is to investigate alternative mooring configurations and hardware to maximize the amount of energy absorption in Navy moorings, especially for moorings in shallow water and/or hard bottom materials (e.g., rock, coral).","It is common for moored shi~ to exhibit oscillatory behavior at single point moorings. This behavior, referred to as ""fishtailing,"" or, ""kiting,"" results in very large hawser tensions as the mooring system restrains the vessel at each end of its swinging. In many moorings, particularly shallow water moorings, this is a serious problem, because the mooring system does not have a large reserve of geometric or material stiffness to absorb these tension spikes. Failure of either the mooring system or the vessel bow structure is not uncommon in these cases. If the mooring system fails, there is the potential for both the loss of the vessel (and its contents) and for environmental damage. On the other hand, if the mooring system capacity is too high, the failure will occur at the bow of the vessel; this possibility is increasing because of the recent trends to trade-off structural weight on combatants to maximize the weapons-related weight. This type of failure results in lost operational time and costs due to shipyard repairs. New moorings are required that will absorb these large tension spikes and therefore minimize the chance for system failures.

This threat is not being considered in most on-going survivability analysis for three reasons: 1) Although the potential for directed energy threats is well established both in terms of effectiveness and feasibility, few tactical weapons have been fielded. The practical nature of the threat is unknown. 2) The damage mechanisms of DEWs are difficult to quantify because they are a function of parameters such as: exposure duration, directed energy transmission frequency, atmospheric conditions, and target field of view, as well as target s shape and material characteristics. 3) Key vulnerable components of many aircraft and weapon systems are the eyes of the personnel involved in be operating the system. It is difficult to quantify the effect of directed energy attacks on vision and the impact of a wide spectrum of vision degradation. Regardless of whether a tactical weapon is fielded and despite the difficulty in determining the effectiveness, Pk, of such weapons against a wide range of targets; the presence of thousands of pseudo-weapons on the modern battlefield requires that aircraft survivability be addressed in the context of directed energy threats. Phase I: Models addressing the physics of the propagation of directed energy are available. It remains to combine such models with models that address the characteristics of a DEW system and the interaction of directed energy on a specific set of targets. Research should focus on the characterization of a weapon system to the extent that the practical utility of DEWS is addressed. The research should also provide survivability analysts with a model that accurately determines the energy reaching various target components. It would then be up to the analysts to devise a test to determine the effect the specified energy would have on the target.",306,1941,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66886/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/66886/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,91.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:56:15,,,,,N91-241_66886,DOD_SBIR_91_P1_C1_N91-241,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:04.998421+00

Simple acoustic transponders are located on central arrays and act as beacons for submarine safety and onboard positioning. The transponders output frequencies are detectable by the submarines's passive sonar but not by the active mine hunting sonar. The practice minefield allows for training of the mine hunting sonar operator in mine detection; the transponder permits real time review of his performance by onboard observers. Limited tracking: data, manual plot methods, and ambiguities in sonar returns means the exact position of the submarine during the exercise is not "" precisely known, creating an inadequate training exercise. The purpose of this project is to develop a ""smart"" transponder and on board tracking system. When one transponder is interrogated by the submarine, it will in turn interrogated by all others in the field. Based on time delay from the transponders to each other and to the submarine, the submarine's exact position can be determined by the onboard tracking system. This would allow for training utilization of every shape in the minefield with an increase in realism and submarine safety.

NISTARS workstations may be fixed in place at carousel storage, storage/retrieval machines, or at packing and receiving stations; or they may be portable radio frequency hand held terminals, allowing worker autonomy and permitting NISTARS control in remote warehouses. The NISTARS warehouse uses bar code identification with issue documentation printed at a packing station. Warehouse workers are required to input numerous simple keyboard entries while using NISTARS, e.g., ""Y"", ""N"", ""[Entry complete]"", ""[Task complete]"", and ""[type in quantity]"". During the stow/issue process the workers must set aside material being handled in order to utilize workstation keyboards. This process costs several seconds per data item entered multiplied by several thousand times per day, equates to many hours of lost productivity. Implementation of an effective voice data entry technology, reducing keyboard data entry, could reduce response time in providing materials and services to the fleet and improve productivity of the warehouse worker. Voice data entry would be especially useful in cold storage warehouses, where heavy gloves make keyboard data entry cumbersome.

The first diagnostic is a system which globally and non-intrusively measures the vibrational and rotational static temperature of the wind tunnel flow surrounding a hypersonic test model. The second is a measurement of local wall skin friction. Both diagnostics are paramount in the understanding of the physics of hypersonic flowfields and the validation of computational fluid dynamic codes. Both systems will enhance existing SBIR efforts and can also be extended to other-than-hypersonic fluid mechanic experimental applications. The temperature measurement diagnostic will enhance the flowfield density measurements obtained from the holographic system currently being developed under SBIR funding. From simultaneous temperature and density measurements, other flowfield properties will be known. Therefore, an entire flowfield can be mapped and completely understood non-intrusively. The skin friction diagnostic will determine the wall shear forces which are needed in the understanding of turbulence and model wall properties. Coupled with the current SBIR program which will enhance our IR camera (wall temperature and heat transfer measurements), this diagnostic will allow for the termination of fluid mechanic surface properties on an aerodynamic model.

The ability of personnel to don the gas mask quickly and effectively is basic to survival in a chemical environment. Although the protective mask is the single most crucial article of chemical defense equipment, there is no current training-effective shipboard method for mask donning drill. Mask training currently takes place during Recruit Training. The training consists of entering a tear gas chamber while wearing the sealed mask, breathing through the filter a few times, and then removing the mask so that the contrast with the protected state is appreciated. This method of training is not feasible for a shipboard environment. Also, research has indicated that the tear gas chamber exercise sometimes decreases confidence rather than promoting it. This occurs because many students are unable to completely seal their masks, but they do not report their failure for fear of having to repeat the exercise.
