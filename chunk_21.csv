Training tasks are becoming more complex due to the increasing sophistication and capability of shipboard electronic systems while demographic data predicts that the number and skill level of Navy trainees will decline over the remainder of this decade. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the ATC operating budget and instructor staff will be decreased. The technical training mission is becoming more difficult while resources are being restricted hence there is a challenge on how to do more with less. The technical work is to determine the effectiveness of current training methods and seek improvements in the following areas, advances in technology of knowledge in training which are more effective than ones currently employed, remediation for students when existing techniques are unsuccessful, requirement that less skilled trainees do not require longer training courses, ways to obtain more productivity from instructors, and teaming of instructors to insure each course is taught by most highly skilled teacher.

The objective of this SBIR project will be to demonstrate the interaction of underwater explosions with naval structures: examples “coupled” problems in the analysis of fluid structure interaction.,"Current capabilities of Continuum Mechanics computer codes fall short of some requirements for practically modeling the interaction of underwater explosions with naval structures. Fundamentally, a code must be capable of analyzing both Fluid Dynamics and Solid/Structural Mechanics behavior in a coupled fashion, since this is a coupled problem. The Fluid Dynamics algorithms must include multiple material, compressible, reactive and multiphase flow capabilities. The Solid/Structural Dynamics algorithms must handle high strain rate, large strain, and strain rate dependant material behavior, in both a Solid Mechanics sense and a Structural Dynamics sense. An available method for such analyses is the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian approach, in which the fluid is fully coupled to a structure. Under development are Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian codes in which the discretization is confined to neither a Lagrangian or Eulerian framework and Boundary Element codes in which material interfaces and other boundaries are discretized in a Lagrangian sense. It is anticipated that an SBIR topic will expand on these ideas or develop newer ones. An example of an undemonstrated technology is the Free-Language or Particle Hydrodynamics method, in which Lagrangian elements or particles are free to move in the flow field, overcoming the most limiting factor of Lagrangian analyses as applied to fluid motions. The final produce must be available in a high-level standard language source code that is not machine specific. It must be modular in the sense that changes and additions can easily be incorporated. The code must handle three dimensional geometries, but most also be capable of analyzing simpler two-dimensional cases. The code must not be limited to fluid structure interaction problems; it must be versatile enough to handle standard hydro code type analyses: penetrators, shaped charges, etc. Phase I, as a feasibility study, should demonstrate the applicability of the chosen method to the underwater explosion fluid structure interaction problem. Phase II will be the development of the technique(s) into a viable and usable product; this includes the generation of full documentation, the integration of user friendly pre and post processor, the validation of the code(s) with benchmark test cases for comparison with data provided by the Navy, and likely the porting of the code(s) to vectorized and/or parallelized machines. Anticipated Phase II transitions include the adaptation of the chose method to fields outside the underwater explosion arena, including other highly dynamic fluid structure interaction problems: nuclear reactor design, air blast simulation, etc.",395,2684,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/64825/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/64825/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:57:31,,,,,N92-069_64825,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C1_N92-069,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:06.046597+00

The use of new, high pressure underwater gauge will permit the detailed investigation of phenomena affecting the lethality of underwater warheads, such as the measurement of the loads on a target from bow shocks of shaped charge jets and the study of the reactions occurring the products of an underwater explosion. The new underwater pressure gauge shall operate in the pressure range of 3 to 250 kbar, with a response time of less than 0.1 microseconds, a recording time of at least 50 microseconds and a desired measurement accuracy of 5%. The sensing area of the gauge should be less than 2 mm in diameter to allow use with curved shock fronts and small explosive charges. Innovative ideas are sought, however, one possible approach is to mount a ruby crystal on the end of an optical fiber, excite the ruby with a laser, and measure the pressure induced fluorescence shift of the ruby with a spectroscope. The optical fiber serves to conduct the laser beam to the ruby and to return the fluorescence data to the spectroscope. The line shift could be measured with a silicon diode array or a streak camera. Phase I shall test the feasibility of the concept. A prototype system will be developed to the point where it can produce a pressure vs. time measurement for a shock known to be above 50 kb. This will test probe survival, response time, and recording time. Thermal effects at the probe need not be removed from the pressure vs. time records during Phase I.

The corresponding peak pressures are 102, 19, and 6 kbar and the times for the pressure to fall to half of peak are 6, 11, and 19 microseconds. Phase II shall produce a laboratory instrument. A prototype system built with improvements suggested by Phase I would be subjected to testing by NAVSWC. From these tests, NAVSWC would evaluate and/make suggestions or further improvements.

Phase I: Adaptive multigrid algorithms will be developed in two stages: Local grid refinement is to be achieved by relating the grid distribution adaptation to the location of rapid changes in the flow fields which will be provided as input data from a separate RANS analysis. IB: Working closely with David Taylor Research Center (DTRC) the local grid refinement process will be integrated with an existing multigrid RANS code in such a way as to permit dynamic grid refinement concurrent with each time step of the RANS solution. Deliverables are 1. Fortran source code 2. Assistance in the integration effort and a report describing effectiveness of the method and a detailed description of the process. Phase II: The adaptive flow solver will be modified to provide best computational efficiency and accuracy when coupled with the various multigrid iteration sequences. As a minimum V cycle and W cycle multigrid sequences will be evaluated. The accuracy and computational efficiencies will be demonstrated when supporting the multi-million cell grid structures necessary to analyze the vertical flows created a by a fully appended submarine. The criteria for accuracy will be the adaptive multigrid flow solver to provide the needed resolution of vorticity strength. Deliverables are adaptive multigrid flow solver source code fully integrated with an appropriate DTRC RANS code and a report describing the algorithms used and an evaluation of computational accuracy and run time performance.",330,2175,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65096/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65096/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:57:42,,,,,N92-099_65096,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C1_N92-099,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:06.046597+00

Experimental data indicates that there are large hydrodynamic lateral and vertical forces and pitching and yawing moments that are developed on the ducted propulsor when the submerged vehicle is maneuvering. In addition the ducted propulsor induces hydrodynamic forces on the after body and the control surfaces in the vicinity of the propulsor. These forces and moments must be calculated in order to evaluate the stability, control, and maneuvering characteristics of the submerged vehicle. There are theoretical and semi-empirical methods for calculating the hydrodynamic forces and moments developed on the hull and appendages for a submerged vehicle with a conventional open propeller. However, there are only approximate empirical methods for calculating the forces developed on ducted propulsors, and these empirical methods are based on a limited experimental data base. The tool that will be developed is to be an integral part of a computer code which will be used to make rapid iterations on candidate new designs for submerged vehicles. Phase I: A theory will be developed for predicting the hydrodynamic lateral and vertical forces and pitching and yawing moments developed on a submerged vehicle with a ducted propulsor. The theory will predict the effect of an angle of attack on the convection of the boundary layer over the after body from the windward side of the hull to the leeward side, and the effect this has on the inflow velocity into the duct. The theory will predict the hydrodynamic forces developed on the propulsor and the forces induced by the propulsor on the hull and appendages in the vicinity of the propulsor for relatively small angles of attack. The investigator will prepare and issue a technical report that will clearly describe the physics of the flow around and through the duct and the theory for predicting the hydrodynamic forces and moments that are developed. The report will also compare the results of the calculations using the theory with appropriate experimental data. Phase II: The theory will be upgraded, if necessary, based on the results of the comparison performed in Phase I. It will then be extended to predict the effect of relatively small pitching and yawing angular velocities. Calculations will be performed with the extended theory and the results will be compared with available experimental data. If the agreement between the theory and the experiments is satisfactory, the method will be upgraded to account for combined large angles of attack and pitching angular velocities or combined angles of drift and yawing angular velocities on the hydrodynamic forces and moments. It will also be extended to predict the effect of over and under propulsion on the effectiveness of the stern control surfaces and the forces and moments due to angle of attack, angle of drift, pitching angular velocity, and yawing angular velocity. A technical report will provide the theory and the results of calculations comparing the theory with appropriate data.",500,3144,1,No,No,No,,,,,0,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65097/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/65097/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,92.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:57:43,,,,,N92-100_65097,DOD_SBIR_92_P1_C1_N92-100,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:06.046597+00

The present method of replacing bearings on a set time schedule is not effective. Faulty bearings are not detected when they fail and many good bearings are replaced unnecessarily. Currently there is no way to test the wing pivot bearings without removing wings from the aircraft. When wing sweep causes excessive bearing noise, aircraft are routed to DEPOT for maintenance. In addition to the excessive maintenance cost of replacing good bearings, faulty bearings on operating aircraft could bind causing the race in the wing or box beam to rotate. Under dynamic flight conditions this could cause cracks in the box beam and result in safety-of-flight problems. Aircraft wing pivot bearings will be tested using the aircraft wing sweep functions as a low speed dynamometer. Either force detection sensors or tensiometer readouts could be used to measure the frictional forces as the wings are swept.

The reaction zone properties are sufficiently different from those of the fiber and matrix, that damaging residual stresses can be generated. Carbon coatings have been used to relieve some of the stresses and have resulted in acceptable composite static strengths. However, during high temperature exposure, the carbon interphase reacts with the matrix to form titanium carbides and other reaction products and causes the thermal/mechanical fatigue behavior of these composites to be relatively poor.

A variety of neural networks approaches have demonstrated the ability to learn simple control laws, solve inverse kinematics problems, do gain scheduling, and develop optimal (or nearly optimal) plans, and to adapt to system changes. All these advances can prove to be of great benefit to UAV applications. Currently, a data link is needed onboard the UAV in order for the ground operator to maintain continuous control of the air vehicles. In the future, the UAV will be called upon to perform more complicated tasks and at greater range and with greater mission endurance. In addition, a single mission control station will be required to control multiple UAVs simultaneously in order to achieve high rate of mission utilization. The real time data link solution for required UAV command and control and communication, may proved to be prohibitively complex and expensive! The greater extent of the UAV autonomous operation will alleviate the UAV data link implementation problems. This project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of using advances in Neural networks to solve autonomous multiple UAVs command and control problems. Three applications areas are: 1. Can a neural network learn to manipulate a conventional flight UAV or nonlinear system such as helicopter type UAV maneuvering in turbulent flow, and recover from extreme changes similar to damage and severe meteorology such as a sudden change of wind on landing, or a change in aerodynamics autonomously? 2. Can a neural network plan an optimal sequence of actions in accomplishing the predefined UAV missions while reacting and adopting to varying external phenomena using onboard sensors as necessary, such as maneuvering autonomously to seek out, locate, and maintain track on the targets of interest, and to complete the mission and return to recovery in a minimum time? 3.

Support for urban combat and other onshore operations with a mobile landing force also mandates a UAV system which requires minimum landing and takeoff area, with little or no surface preparation before use.

The high altitude bombing scenario looks to be a viable tactic reaching well into the next century. With the advent of new generations of stealth aircraft and internally carried weapon stores the problems of target acquisition, platform-weapon transfer alignment, and accurate guidance over long ranges becomes more challenging. Aircraft sensor data will have to be transferred to internal stores prior to launch as weapon sensors will be shielded behind closed doors. With projected launches from as high as 60,000 feet, GPS or other aiding will be required to assure adequate IMU accuracy. The tradeoffs between aircraft sensor, weapon sensor, and GPS system accuracies required for accurate high altitude bombing in the year 2000 and beyond is the subject of this SBIR. Phase I will consist of a survey of projected state-of-the-art for the required sensors in the year 2000, development of mathematical models to match projected tactical scenarios, and some basic subsystem tradeoff analysis to characterize the feasibility of the high altitude bombing concept and establish parameters/accuracy budgets for the various subsystems. Phase II will involve in-depth studies of the selected optimal configurations, characterization of the recommended approaches with the model, build-up of basic prototype hardware, and laboratory and field tests to verify system concepts. Phase I: Characterization of sensors, development of models, and subsystem tradeoff studies to validate and optimize high altitude bombing concept. Phase II: Refinement and optimization of system designs and phase I, buildup of prototype hardware, and laboratory/field tests to validate the models and verify system concepts.

Specifically, component quality could be improved or at least reject rates could be minimized if the effect of external process variations on material behavior could be monitored directly. Conventional sensor concepts have some shortcomings. They act as point sensors and therefore require some prior knowledge of critical areas for placement. Their presence in the system may affect the parameters being studied. An alternate approach for sensor systems would be to use piezoelectric films. These materials have the potential for monitoring both temperature and pressure over the entire surface of the tools used in production. Also, film transducers can be made extremely them (<1 mil) and applied as coatings. Conventional transducer materials are limited in application temperature to approximately 2008F.

A planner may be able to determine the general area in which a map is needed, but not whether or not the map, once produced will be viable. A proof-of-concept of an approach that combines map construction rules, terrain analysis, and route planning placement requirements is sought. The concept for map placement should support 2 modes: 1) requesting TERCOM maps to support a particular mission or set of missions, and 2) requesting TERCOM maps to populate a new scenario before specific mission tasking exists. The mission specific mode should be robust enough to support both automated planner assistance and completely automated modes of operation. The non-mission specific mode should assist in determining if map availability is even a problem before TERCOM maps are requested. Phase I: Should consist of determining the feasibility of the proposed approach for identifying suitable areas for map construction. Phase I should be accomplished by engineering assessment, development of a concept of operations, and the application of off the shelf commercial rapid prototyping tools as appropriate.

For example an anti-radiation missile could be rendered ineffective if the enemy turned of their active RF emitters during the terminal homing phase. To circumvent this tactic, future weapon systems may have to incorporate visual or thermal imaging systems along with radiation homing to track and destroy the target. These imaging systems typically have difficulty processing target information where the target is changing aspect or perspective or is occluded, let alone finding a designated aim-point. Optical processing systems, owing to their inherent speed and two dimensional image processing capability can potentially overcome the problems of processing rapidly changing, cluttered data from imaging sensors and performing aim point selection in real time. What is needed is a new and innovative approach to the design of an optical correlator system capable of inputting infra-red or video generated scenes and extracting and recognizing selected target features in the presence of clutter, noise or obstructions. Phase I should consist of the development of the theory, mathematical basis and algorithms and an optical architecture concept.

The engines have output in the 25 to 100 HP range and have airflows less than or equal to 1.0 lb/sec (at standard conditions). Desired filtration is 60 mesh. Phase I: It is anticipated that investigation into candidate concepts would be divided into two phases. Phase I would generate conceptual designs which would be validated through theory and analytical assessment and/or testing.

The engines are designed to operate at altitudes in the range of sea level to 40K feet. During engine testing, it is desirable to accurately measure airflow to determine volumetric efficiency, specific air consumption, and the air fuel ratio. It is understood that any appreciable pressure drop across the airflow measuring device will have an undesirable effect on engine performance. It should also be noted that the engine airflow is not steady, but pulsating. Venturi effects have a pressure drop associated with them and are not available with enough accuracy in the large turndown range required to test these engines in the altitude range described above. Positive displacement measurement from a gas holder is accurate but bulky and cumbersome. A plenum chamber with an orifice needs to be very large to be accurate and produces a significant pressure drop. Other problems associated with directly measuring airflow may be found in the SAE Technical paper 890242, entitled Airflow Measurement in Internal Combustion Engines by C. R. Stone. For these reasons, the Navy would like to investigate innovative concepts for directly measuring airflow into internal combustion engines in the 25 to 100 HP range, with associated airflows up to 1.0 1b/sec. The immediate objective of this program is ground test cell use. However, systems usable for lightweight in-flight advanced engine control usage would have additional merit.

An economical and efficient means of interfacing to the FADECs used with the various engines in the Navy inventory is sought.,"Engines developed for the Navy are equipped with FADECs containing a 1553 Bus interface. All future engines are expected to be so equipped. At present, either the engine manufacture provides the engine test facility with a controller unit, or the test facility must purchase or rent a controller identical to the one used by the manufacturer. As more engines are developed and manufactured with FADECs outfitted with 1553 Bus interfaces, this method of providing for bus controllers becomes more cumbersome, inadequate, and costly, since the Navy is faced with the need to support a multitude of controllers. The bus controller should be tailored for control room use at engine test facilities. Interface to the engine operator panel should remain consistent from test to test. Real time display of parameters should be developed. A reliable interface to the facility main frame computer should be established which will allow quick turn around time of data. Engines utilizing FADECs which require 1553 bus Controllers will ultimately be rebuilt and tested at NARFS. These facilities will be faced with the need to obtain bus controllers. The standard 1553 Bus controllers developed for NAPC would find direct application at these facilities. Phase I: The first phase of the research is to conclude a feasibility study. The study will: 1) analyze hardware and software requirements; and 2) complete a detailed proposal for a prototype standard 1553 Bus controller. The concept must allow for configuration by the user, interface to control room displays and inputs, and communication of information to a main frame computer in real time. Event recording with play back capability is also required. Phase II: The prototype defined in phase I is to be constructed and tested to preset guidelines. The test will determine the effectiveness of the proposed methodology under NAPC specified conditions. The prototype demonstration will include validation of the concept under actual test conditions.

Bottom reverberation is an extremely complex phenomenon owing to the diversity of ocean floor types, lateral inhomogeneity, and potential contribution of subbottom layers. The received backscattered return is typically a composite process with two or more reverberation types contributing at any given instant. This is especially true in shallow-water environments. In this context, the spatial correlation characteristics of various reverberation components are critically important. The shallow-water environment creates some unique difficulties. As opposed to deep-water settings where the acoustic paths are few and identifiable, shallow-water reverberation returns arrive in rapid succession, imposing stringent adaptation requirements on the adaptive filter and complicating the performance evaluation process. Acoustic reverberation often limits the performance of active sonar systems and spatial reverberation cancellation is required to achieve adequate performance. Reverberation is a particularly difficult source of interference owing to its transient nature, wide dynamic range, and highly uncorrelated properties. Adaptive beamforming techniques offer the potential for reverberation suppression, typically employing an adaptive estimator in conjunction with directional constraints to ensure signal preservation.",178,1415,1,No,No,No,,,,"Potential Phase III transition opportunities are SURTASS, SQQ-89, and Advanced Deployable Systems",1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58090/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/58090/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:58:31,,,,,N93-037_58090,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C1_N93-037,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:06.532868+00

The hood design must prevent the aerosols from contaminating the exhaust ductwork and components located downstream of the hood. Present contamination creates a potential fire hazard and increases maintenance efforts in ductwork downstream of the hood. Studies completed by the Navy, as well as, experience reported from the fleet, indicate that the galley exhaust hoods used in both submarines and surface ships do not adequately remove grease aerosols from the galley exhaust air. The exhaust hoods use an inertial type mechanism for grease removal. ASHRAE has reported that inertial extraction methods are ineffective for particle sizes less the 5 microns. The Navy study also revealed that during the cooking process, the particle distribution ranged from less than 1 microns to 35 microns. The objective of this topic is to develop a galley exhaust hood that will remove all aerosols, including those less than 5 microns.

An innovative approach to super high density digital memory is to use Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) as the driver for writing and reading bits of stored information at the atomic level. A cluster of a few atoms, deposited in a small area called a unit cell, can serve as the basic structure for storing one bit of information. The presence and absence of the small cluster of metal atoms within the cell can be read by the STM probe to indicate the bit of information. Since the unit cell can be as small as 2 nm, the memory density can approach 25 trillion bits per square centimeter. This is five orders of magnitude more dense than the densest solid state memory chip today (256 MB). The writing process consists of deposition of a cluster of metal atoms in a cell of the thin film lattice, and the reading process is the scanning of the cells in sequence in order to detect the presence of the metal atom clusters.

The system must be capable of comparing forces and systems across warfare mission areas and should allow the appraisal of naval forces to be based on contribution to joint war fighting capability. The system should be flexible enough to address a broad range of uncertainty. Navy and DoD decision makers must know that their choices will maximize warfare capability over a wide range of assumptions made in the size, composition and quality of projected threats, and in the conditions under which the future wars might be fought. The system is envisioned as a tool that will allow appraisals of alternative naval force structures and systems to be based on their ability to influence the outcome of a series of approved regional planning scenarios. However, the tool to be developed must resolve certain deficiencies that exist with current campaign level force-on-force models. The ability of naval forces to influence the outcome of a land campaign depends on the value to the campaign outcome of the operational tasks assigned to naval power projection forces and systems. The process is complicated by the requirement to protect high value launch platforms. To insure that the value of forces and weapons are accurately estimated, the tool must provide a systematic way to assign available resources to competing operational tasks and targets so as to maximize the benefit of the weapons to the campaign. to insure the opponent cannot negate the value of a force improvement by changing his strategy, the mechanisms must work for both sides. The system must also address the problem of timeliness.

The module would interface with commercial available digital signal processor (DSP) modules to enable the quick design of new receive terminals.,"In Very Low Frequency (VLF) communications, the future progress possible in digital signal processing is now limited by the ability of receivers to convert analog signals to digital format over a large dynamic range (126 decibels or greater). Signal processing has been shown to be an effective method to compensate for a lack of transmitter power. Since it is desired to communicate over greater ranges from few sites, more signal processing is preferred. Reconstruction of the communication signal in the presence of larger signals is also dependent on the amount of dynamic range available to the receiver. In cases where the communication signal is within a few dB of the noise floor of the receiver, signal reconstruction can be extremely difficult. The greater the dynamic range of the front end, the greater the interfering signals will have to be to disrupt communications. Recent advances in digital signal processing have made it desirable to move the analog to digital conversion closer to the input of the receiver and to do less of the signal conditioning in the analog domain.

It is often very difficult to determine when a trainee is really competent to perform on-the-job. Traditionally, trainees are judged to be ready for graduation from a training course when coursework is complete if the average grade from periodic testing are above a predetermined criterion level. Grades are most often determined through paper and pencil testing, although performance on simulated tasks may also be graded. This system is far from perfect because it is based upon the assumption that memory for facts and figures is correlated with performance. Indeed, memory is correlated with performance, but the correlation for any particular job may be rather low. In the classroom environment, performance testing may not be possible because of resource, technological, and safety restrictions. Alternative methods to estimate learning and retention of complex skills and knowledge could improve assessment in many job specialties. (funding for this Phase I will not exceed $50,000) Phase I: It is known that learning results in long-term changes in the brain which can possibly be assessed using modern neuroscience techniques. One measure that has been shown to reflect changes in the brain structure and function is the event-related potential (ERP). In the standard paradigm, individuals are exposed to a stimulus that is presumed to be related to the function being measured. Brain electrical or magnetic activity is recorded just prior to, and following, the stimulus. The shape of the waveform that is recorded is affected by the perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes associated with the task. Previous research has suggested that semantic knowledge can be reliably assessed using these techniques. The purpose of this research would be to identify and develop specific ERP techniques to assess knowledge and skill, and demonstrate that these techniques can reliably assess knowledge and skill for a subset of tasks similar to a specific Navy job. Phase II: Once the techniques have been developed and assessed, it will be necessary to evaluate their usefulness in a Navy population. This would involve trainees in a technical training course. Initially, the work would involve the selection of the skill and knowledge domain to be used in the evaluation. It is anticipated that performance tests would have to be developed if they do not already exist. Once the domain is selected, trainees would be evaluated periodically during training.",389,2492,1,No,No,No,,,,Commercialization to other government and private sector areas.,1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62904/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/62904/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,93.2 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 12:59:28,,,,,N93-187_62904,DOD_SBIR_93_P1_C2_N93-187,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:07.50189+00

Depending on the inferred cognitive state of the operator, the system will modify its characteristics---interface, workload, level of automation---so as to maximize the combat effectiveness of the operator. Research has shown that biopsychometric techniques based on EEG and event-related potentials (ERP) provide information about the cognitive state of human operators in laboratory simulations of Navy combat systems. EEG measures provide indices of alertness in vigilance tasks such as sonar monitoring. ERP measures index operator workload and can predict performance in resource-limited tasks such as electronic warfare. Other research has shown that biopsychometric techniques may also allow for real-time monitoring of cognitive state in aviators. In addition, biopsychometric methods will have impact on simulator-based training, by adapting the training protocol to the current ability of the trainee.

In Phase I, studies and designs are invited for compact, rugged, and portable systems for operational EEG data acquisition and signal processing. Such systems must address three fundamental technical problems: (1) Standard electrode assemblies which are minimally obtrusive, easily attached in a few minutes by operational personnel, require no adhesives or special electrolyte compounds, and provide adequate signal-to-noise ratio for recording the EEG, (2) real-time signal processing capability which allows for analog amplification, anti-alias and notch filtering, as well as for digital processing including ensemble averaging, digital filtering, spectral analyses, multiresolution analyses or sub-band coding, and wavelet transforms. The system must be able to apply such algorithms to multi-electrode EEG data obtained at data rates of about 10K samples per second, obtain results, and supply them to the system for use in adaptive algorithms within a 30-second window of acquisition time, and (3) large storage capability suitable for recording for several hours of unattended operation at data rates of 10,000 samples per second or approximately 300 megabytes. Such storage should be resistant to operational hazards such as electrical or magnetic fields encountered on ships and aircraft.",Prototype signal acquisition/processing systems will be developed and evaluated in candidate Navy operational tasks including sub-surface ASW and surface EW. Navy laboratories using biopsychometric technology will perform the evaluations and provide feedback to designers as required.

However, a successful air war cannot be guaranteed because of the lethality of modern air defense weapons prevalent on the battlefield. Therefore, the Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) will be an integral part of any military campaign in the future. Using the Decoy UAV as part of the SEAD mission, the effectiveness of our military forces can be enhanced and the survivability of our air assets can be increased. The UAV electronic decoy payload will replicate electronic signatures of various aircraft. It will be capable of generating multiple false targets to draw enemy fire in order to protect our air assets. The payload will also have built-in self-protection techniques to prevent enemy radar from locking-on to the UAV. The typical decoy currently in the inventory is limited in the use of its radar augmentation device. The device can replicate the electronic signature of only one aircraft.

Millimeter-wave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)/radiometer and multi-band infrared sensor technology incorporated into a MSI payload can detect responses in both the millimeter-wave and infrared frequency spectrums. MSI payload data can yield a wealth of information for planners of naval and amphibious warfare operations. For ocean surveillance, MSI payload data can measure wave height, determine sea state, forecast ocean condition, identify targets, and detect ship wakes. For over-land reconnaissance, MSI payload data can be used to identify terrain features, types of vegetation, camouflage nets, concealed targets, snow and ice layer composition, and soil conditions. MSI payload data can also be used to predict beach condition, determine water depth near the shore, and locate inshore mines. Finally, MSI payload data can contribute to Automatic Target Recognition/Cuing (ATR/C) when combined with signal processing techniques. Currently, MSI data originating from reconnaissance satellites is not responsive to user needs due to the long time between satellite visits to the area of interest. A UAV MSI system would be more responsive to the operational commander's needs because it can loiter over the area of interest for extended periods of time and can provide the necessary coverage in near-realtime. MSI sensors have been employed successfully by the civilian sector in remote sensing applications, e.g., forecasting crop yield, surveying forests, mapping of potential mineral resources, patrolling ice formation for maritime safety, monitoring pollution, etc. It is envisioned that the UAV MSI system will be capable of performing similar civilian missions.

In short, it is the problem of rapidly constructing a physically realized hardware prototype.","Programmable gate arrays are a component technology that is potentially very useful in solving rapid prototyping problems. The technology provides a programmable hardware element that could be made to represent essentially any arbitrarily complex digital circuit. The individual gate array circuits are VLSI devices and contain several thousand gates each, organized into hundreds of configurable logic blocks. It is a very flexible, potentially useful technology. Recent activities towards the exploitation of this technology have focused on the problem of providing `arrays of programmable gate arrays'; that is, the focus is on the problem of interconnecting the gate arrays in networks, so that one could map very large digital circuits onto the network. This will eliminate the fairly severe limitations on the utility of the technology, when applied one device at a time, and open the doors to the possibility of processor rapid prototyping. The proposed solution to the processor rapid prototyping problem brings together two technologies in an eminently synergistic manner. The first is the Programmable Gate Array (PGA) circuit technology; the second is the JRS Integrated Design Automation System (IDAS) technology. PGA technology is being pursued by constructing large arrays of the devices, that will provide between 500,000 and 1,000,000 equivalent gates or 10,000 to 20,000 configurable logic blocks, that can be automatically configured to represent complex processors. This size array can be packaged onto one VME size board that plugs directly into the backplane of an appropriate host (e.g., SUN). The PGA board can then be driven by the host processor; it can be configured by it; it can receive static or dynamic input data from it; and, it can return output data to it, statically or dynamically. The host processor provides the environment for testing a prototype, for doing an evaluation of its suitability or comparative effectiveness. The PGA board becomes a hardware simulator/emulator of the target processor; it provides the test bed for testing and evaluating alternatives. The PGA board can then be the actual physical hardware prototype or the configuration data can be transferred to other physical instantiations that might be more useful in a particular system environment. IDAS technology provides the processor synthesis tools and the links to designers working in VHDL that are necessary to effectively utilize the potential of the PGA board in a significant manner. Processor synthesis in IDAS creates processor representations that are implemented in components contained in libraries and are expressible in VHDL. The VHDL description is then processed to generate a software simulator for the implemented processor. One will then be able to use IDAS to synthesize application specific processors, simulate and evaluate them very fast on the PGA Board, and return results to designers. The configured PGA Board, or a translated image of it, could also be used as a physical prototype for actual interconnection to other hardware such as the backplane of the AN/UYS-2.",478,3106,1,No,No,No,,"Construct 500,000 to 1,000,000 equivalent gates array packaged onto one VME size board that plugs directly into the backplane of an appropriate host (e.g., SUN).

The Pulse Detonation Engine embodies such a concept. PDEs employ an air breathing, constant volume process, marked by high gas pressures (10-100 atmospheres) and temperatures (>2000o C). These are conditions with higher power densities than conventional engines. Like all air breathing engines, PDEs offer a higher specific impulse than solid rocket motors.

Much of this material is being turned in simply because assigned shelf-life periods have expired. A study conducted by the Navy during 1992 showed that many assigned shelf-life periods bear little relationship to the true deterioration characteristics of hazardous material or its packaging and that the true life of the material considerably longer than assigned shelf-life codes indicate. This leads to the conclusion that shelf-life periods are artificial and much of the Navy's hazardous waste generation would be avoided if users of hazardous material had a simple way to tell whether or not their on-hand material was still good. One way to do this would be to develop sensors that detect hazardous material deterioration and put the readouts for the sensors on the exterior of all hazardous material containers.

The telecommunications industry has shown the potential benefits of optical amplification and is planning implementation of transcontinental undersea links using this technology. Optical amplification can be achieved through the use of rare earth doped optical fibers (or rods) which are pumped with semiconductor light sources or through the use of stimulated emission in semiconductor materials. It is therefore the intent of this solicitation to develop optical amplifiers utilizing the above mentioned or alternative technical approaches. The amplifiers must be capable of operation in severe avionic applications. The proposed approach should emphasize low cost, weights and size and have the ability to survive the temperature, shock and vibration of a high performance aircraft. Since the length of fibers on aircraft is relatively short, the gain of these amplifiers may not necessarily be as high as that of typical telecommunication amplifiers. The design should emphasize low noise performance and suitability for both analog and digital applications. Optical amplifiers operating in the 850, 1300, and 1500 nanometer wavelengths are desired with the specific technical approach keyed to a particular wavelength.

Phase I: Detailed trade study comparing the AS4075, X3T9.5, and alternative high speed protocols for real-time control applications. The trade study should specifically address the features of each bus protocol standard including, but not limited to, data rates, critical timing delays and determinism.

In order to provide fault tolerance in a network, it is highly desirable to accommodate a multiplicity of fiber optic input lines into a terminal with the ability to switch the most desirable input signal or signals to the receiver circuit(s) with minimal time delay based on the amplitude of the input signals. The use of an array of PIN photodiodes with a switchable bias voltage applied to individual array elements can perform such a function. A monolithic chip implementation of such a switchable array complete with an amplitude detection and threshold circuits, low noise receivers, and decision logic can dramatically reduce the cost of such circuitry.

In employing these weapons, the AGM-84E Standoff Land Attack Missile (SLAM) and the AGM-62 TV Walleye, the operator steers the weapon to the target using infrared and television guidance, respectively, and a hands-on slew stick. Simulating this process in a two-dimensional space, as observed in present part-task training devices, provides little operator realism. Using a three-dimensional display and employing concepts of virtual reality, the operator's point of view can be placed either in the cockpit or in the seeker head of the weapon, at his option. This will enable the operator to improve his timing and performance by acquiring a better understanding and ""feel"" for the weapon's response to the slew stick. Phase I: Examine a number of design approaches for injecting the virtual representation of the SLAM and Walleye missiles into the a Navy trainer. Determine the feasibility of the best approach. Phase II: Develop a ""virtual world"" representation for SLAM and Walleye terminal guidance and specify any dedicated hardware and/or peripherals, such as a helmet-mounted display, and their interface required for installation into the trainer selected in Phase I. Develop a prototype, using this trainer as a testbed. The Navy will be responsible for testing and validation. Phase III: Install the software and any required hardware into the Navy trainer used in Phases I and II.

However, when the threat EM source is shut off for countermeasure purposes or fails to radiate during pre-emptive launch, the HARM must maintain course without additional guidance information from the radiating source. Several incidents during Operation Desert Storm highlight the lack of ARM's ability to identify and guide toward a selected/specified target in a ""shutdown"" environment. In order to significantly increase the probability of kill (Pk) and reduce the probability of fratricide, a secondary sensor is needed to supply guidance information during the terminal flight phase. Novel proposals are sought for a secondary sensor that will also provide an aimpoint select capability and address the need for Battle Damage Assessment. Contractors should consider sensor and guidance candidates that are compatible with the current HARM airframe. Phase I: Perform an investigative study of the proposed secondary sensor system that provides proof-of-concept using computer simulations and models and/or a partial breadboard system. Phase II: Construct a brassboard system that demonstrates critical elements of the sensor concept and prepare a documentation package that is suitable for taking the concept to Advanced Development. Conduct studies validating the performance of the proposed system. Phase III: Advanced Development -- Develop prototype missile systems to undergo laboratory, field, environmental, captive flight and free flight test and evaluation that validates the concept. Prepare a documentation package that is suitable for taking the concept to Engineering Manufacturing Development.

The experimental apparatus consisted of a small tank with separate receiving and transmitting antennas. An electromagnetic wave, whose wavelength had decreased because of the salt water and was comparable to the size of the mine, was emitted from one antenna. A second antenna collected the scattered wave and the fourier transform was taken from this signal. From this, it was observed that different objects in the tank yielded different transform components. However, due to the high attenuation of the wave due to the conductivity of the water, the high dispersion changing the wave shape and the fact that salt water is electrically conductive, data processing played an important part in this system of mine detection. Would it be possible to optimize the data processing system? Would processing two or three components simultaneously (Ex,Ey, Hz for example) yield a higher detection probability? Would a transmitted square wave signal be superior to a tone burst? Is the fourier transform the optimal transform? Would a statistical approach be better?

Currently multispectral imaging systems are limited by using the sum as the source of illumination. It would significantly enhance a multispectral remote sensing systems capability by utilizing an efficient real time electronically tunable solid state laser as a source of illumination. Innovative concepts are sought to design such a laser illuminator. Ideally, the laser would be pulsed with a pulse repetition rate (PRF) of at least 30Hz (video rate) and frequency selectable at the PRF with sufficient plank power to illuminate the ground for the multispectral imager.

Silicon additions, as SiC or MoSi2, were found to provide the highest oxidation resistance, although additions of al, Y, Cr, and other elements were also attempted. It is believed that other diboride alloy compositions may provide substantially greater high-temperature oxidation resistance than the Si-alloyed ZrB2 and HfB2 materials. Improved materials could have application in commercial and DoD hypersonic vehicle nosecaps and leading edges, solid and liquid rocket nozzles, air-breathing propulsion hot sections, high-temperature furnace heating elements, and possibly electrodes for A1 production. Oxidation resistance improvement may be possible by several approaches. A direction that has not been explored is the alloying of diborides other than the group IV metals, such as the group V or group VI metals. Metal-oxide free energies of formation (FEOF) increase in the progression of group IV to V to VI transition metals. This suggests that the latter metal borides show the highest promise of exhibiting enhanced oxidation resistance with alloying additions of A1, Si, or possibly Cr. Another possible direction is the addition of Be, even into groups IV diborides, taking advantage of the very low FEOF and slow diffusion properties of BeO.

The ability to evaluate various system behaviors at many different stages of the design process becomes necessary for the system engineers. Although, methods and techniques for design evaluation exist, they are typically fragmented and are performed independently. Usually, each method only allows system engineers to evaluate certain aspects of the system at a time, and/or it only focuses on certain design stages. The integration of existing methods which allows system engineers to evaluate many system aspects at various design stages is necessary but unachievable at this moment due to the diversity of how information is being represented in these methods. The method(s) developed within this research should show the understanding of different evaluation techniques for system behaviors at various stages in the system development process. The method(s) should allow the evaluation of both the control behavior of the total system as well as the detail behaviors that are associated with particular system's functions or resources. Hence, the control representations for system behavior has to be addressed in a hierarchical manner to accommodate different levels of fidelity. The hierarchical concept would provide options for system engineers to address the system's behavior at both abstract and detail level of complexity. The method(s) should also supports system engineers as well as domain experts to easily understand the control states of the system. For example undesirable control states has to be recognized by all persons who involve in the system development process. The method also has to allow system engineers to specify the system robustly so that a direct transformation between the representation information and the evaluation techniques can take place.

The research should augment the current traceability case tool environment which current concentrates on tracing Requirements throughout the initial stages of system/software development.,"It is essential that computer intensive systems being built fully contain the desired and specified functionality and are maintainable over long periods of time. Traceability is essential in achieving these goals. Lack of full traceability causes inefficient systems to be built that do not fully capture all the required functionality. Also systems which lack traceability are extremely difficult to maintain because the effects of changes to parts of the system are unknown and could create disastrous results. There are several commercially available system/software requirement traceability tools which can be used to solve some of the above concerns. But these tools concentrate on the linking of the requirements to the initial phases of the design cycle (structured analysis, structured design, etc.) Their methodologies fall short in terms of linking throughout the later parts of the design cycle (i.e., simulation, testing, implementation, etc. Generic objects can be created to represent these items but direct tracing to capture representation of these later design phases fail to exist. A more complete traceability methodology which concentrates on the design representation throughout the entire life cycle needs to be developed. A traceability tool will require interfaces that allow the interaction between the different tools which captures each part of the design is also essential along with the ability to link the method to current design and implementation tools.

Their work included developing a proposed revision to MIL-H-8501A and the associated background information users guide (BUIG). Aeronautical Design Standard 33C (ADS-33C) was developed for future Army LH testing. Recent Army flight tests were conducted to validate ADS-33C requirements for the AH-64A and OH-58C helicopters. The Army is currently working to get the proposed rotorcraft handling qualities specification approved as a joint MIL-SPEC. Commercial activities producing aircraft for the Army, and other services like the Navy are currently involved or will be involved in the near future. It is important to get commercial and military flight test engineers and pilots up-to-speed on the proposed rotorcraft handling qualities, and frequency domain specification requirements as soon as possible. Phase I: Review all previous, current, and proposed rotorcraft handling qualities and flight control system criteria and specifications. Development a proposal to show how this information could be incorporated into a PC tutorial to be used by flight test engineers. Also develop a proposal to show which flight test data are required for the tutorial and how the data can be obtained from typical flight tests to build a flight test database. Phase II: Develop the rotorcraft handling qualities specification and flight control system PC tutorial and install it at a specified military or commercial activity and tie the PC tutorial into an existing network system. Assist and support two flight test programs to check-out and validate the PC tutorial, showing how flight test data can be added to the database.

Unstructured grids are able to efficiently incorporate adaptive refinement and moving boundaries. Technology is currently available to model and analyze complex 3-D configurations using unstructured inviscid codes. This technology has been applied recently to aircraft store separation problems using single block tetrahedral fixed meshes. Aircraft store separation is a viscosity dominated, multi-body interaction problem. The Navy is soliciting innovative approaches utilizing extensions (like moving grids and adaptive refinements) to the unstructured grid technology to the aircraft store carriage and separation problem. Phase I: The objective is to explore application of advanced unstructured grid methodology to the store separation problem and to arrive at a set of guidelines for further development. Phase II: The objective is the development of a comprehensive, interactive method and software to analyze and predict multi-body store separation behavior. Phase III: During this phase, utilization of the software would be funded by Navy test projects requiring advanced aerodynamic-structural integration analyses.

This decision aid will evaluate whether a particular advanced technology will improve availability when compared to a baseline technology.,"The propulsion technology development community's main focus has been on performance. Some promising technologies were never transitioned because it was determined during acquisition they were too difficult to support. Some were transitioned, but support capability wasn't fully secured for several years because supportability issues were addressed too late. This effort will help decision makers identify and pursue the technologies that are more supportable. Also, it will help bring to light any critical supportability issues early in the development and design of future systems. Availability is achieved by design characteristics such as: reliability, maintainability etc. along with support system characteristics like: repair and inspection capability and spares posture. Technologies should be developed and transitioned into fleet engines that optimize the relations between these parameters. Phase I: Develop a model identifying the relations between all critical parameters for a propulsion system that affects availability. Develop a representative set of metrics to quantify the parameters of this model. Develop a set of decision rules that establish weights (relative importance) between the parameters. Provide a detailed report documenting all Phase I efforts. Phase II: Develop a database that provides baseline technology metrics for each parameter for all major parts of an engine. This should incorporate the support requirements (equipment and procedures) for each major part. Develop a detailed model and the software for the decision aid. Construct a computer-based, prototype system. Conduct a simulation of the decision aid by imputing a list of advanced propulsion technologies and their metric values to determine their impact on availability when compared to a baseline. Assess the viability of the results. Phase III: Based on favorable results of Phase II, further develop this model for actual application. Commercial Potential: This decision aid will be easily modified for applications to commercial aircraft systems. Also many other technical areas are confronted with decisions of technology insertion and their impact on availability.

The substrate support and the diamond indenter head will be independently temperature controlled via the computer and the process will take place in an inert gas atmosphere.","A completely new approach for microelectronics device fabrication consists in the incorporation of cleavage microcracks on an otherwise crack free material. Once the microcracks are introduced, they can be filled with different electronic materials to achieve the desired electronic properties. In order to succeed in this new approach, a controlled way of introducing microcracks in crystalline substrates is required. Commercial microindenters have been used to introduce microcracks in crystalline substrates. Unfortunately, they have only one diamond pyramid in the indenter head and the positioning of the substrate relative to the indenter is performed manually. As a result, alignment of the indentation marks is difficult and poor microcracks develop. This problem can be solved by incorporating two aligned diamond pyramids in a single indenter head. The diamond pyramid tip to tip separation being approximately 2000 mm. A computer controlled substrate positioning table would allow for the incorporation of multiple microcracks in one substrate for multielectronic device fabrication. The applied loads will range between 100g and 2000g. The substrate and indenter head temperature control would allow the cracks to grow without introducing further plastic deformation. Finally the controlled gas atmosphere would prevent contaminants from entering the crack region.

One of the double Vickers indenter will be fabricated so that the pyramids have a common side while the other will be fabricated so that the pyramids have a common vertex.

The usefulness of the methodology needs to be demonstrated with an application to either a military or a civilian helicopter.,"At the Naval Postgraduate School, Chaos Theory has recently been applied to vibration reduction in helicopters. The flight test sensor data that was used was divided into two components: (1) Harmonic Component and (2) Chaotic Component. The harmonic component was deemed controllable, with the associated benefits being possible vibration reduction and improvement in structural life. Chaos Theory has been applied in various scientific disciplines, chiefly sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. However, the theory has not reached a stage where it can be put to practical use in an aircraft. Further research is needed to establish the usefulness of Chaos Theory to the active control of nonlinear vibrations in helicopters.

Currently, air atomizing and hydraulic type atomizing nozzles are being studied. A need exists to develop a converging-diverging nozzle to produce high velocity small diameter droplets. The successful nozzle system must be small and light weight, activate in a temperature range of 65oF to +300oF, conform to MIL STD 704E Aircraft Electrical Power Characteristics and conform to an aircraft environment.

The droplet velocity and system response must be faster than the velocity of the pressure wave of the deflagration of a JP-4 or JP-5 fuel-air mixture to successfully prevent an explosion. Both droplet size and droplet velocity must be verified. Phase I: A Fine Water Mist Nozzle System design is expected as a deliverable of Phase I. The system will include the successful nozzle design for dispersion of high velocity small diameter droplets. A final report must be provided, outlining the Computational Fluid Dynamics process used to determine the prototype design.

Presently a 2 nm interference filter with 70% transmission is being used as a base line. If a filter is used with a transmission linewidth ratio greater than the base line it will reduce the requirements for the laser transmitter or enhance the performance depth.

Most of these systems are mounted in precisely surveyed towers located at strategic locations on a test range. A few of these systems, equipped with special stable platforms, are mounted in aircraft. The systems on the ground are often unusable because of low altitude haze or fog. The aircraft mounted systems are often unusable because of the cost of deploying the aircraft and because the aircraft cannot be brought close enough to the test, for safety reasons, to collect adequate optical information. The desired characteristics of this topic's optical instrumentation platform are as follows: Ability to remain on station for periods of up to 8 hours at wind speeds of up to at least 35 knots; ability to collect optical information annotated with the direction the telescope was pointed and the time of day for which the data applies, ability to detect and record high speed encounters such as a MACH 4 missile approaching head on to a MACH 3 aircraft.

The tracking of missiles with radar requires line of sight coverage during missile flight. The flight envelopes of current and future missiles make it impractical to provide line of sight radar coverage at land ranges and virtually impossible at ocean ranges. Also, the position accuracy obtained by the best range instrumentation radars is not sufficient to evaluate end game results without additional complex instrumentation. The requirement is for a four or more channel GPS receiver and data link capable of providing the accuracy for unaided end game evaluation, over the horizon coverage, inertial interpolation of position sufficient for ten to fifteen updates per second, and one second launch initiation.

The barrier will have the option of being deployed by vehicle or helicopter when circumstances dictate. The barrier will perform on hard and soft surfaces without surface preparation. The barrier will employ the weight/mass of the vehicular threats to stop the vehicle.,"There are many vehicle barriers in commercial/Government use. All of these barriers rely on their own weight, size, and mass to dissipate a vehicle's kinetic energy. None of the current barriers in use address the need to deploy barriers on a short notice by only a few people. Without the aid of some type of handling equipment it would be impossible to deploy them at all. The barriers that have been developed as man portable have proven to be highly ineffective. The systems rely only on tire deflation as a means to stop vehicle threats. The deflation of a vehicle's tires at high speed does not effectively disable the vehicle. A vehicle can continue to run on deflated tires and the barrier can be averted by filling the tires with foam or other materials in anticipation of such an action. Phase I: Determine operational/physical requirements. These requirements will be based on intended uses, available materials, and methods of deployment. Evaluate existing concepts. Investigate possible abstracts of concepts. Select most desirable concepts for prototype design, test, and evaluation. Phase II: Prove barrier design theory through modeling and testing. Develop proven design and provide prototype fabrication drawings for barrier system. Manufacturer a working prototype of the designed barrier, conduct full scale tests and provide test results report.

Current procedures for predicting seismic ground motion amplification are inadequate to accurately predict the amplification and requires soil tests to determine material properties. Microseismic data can be recorded on soil and on rock and a transfer amplification function can in theory be developed. If this is achieved, a revolutionary breakthrough will be made by eliminating the reliance on soil testing to determine a site's properties and then using those properties in an analysis. Use of microseism data will permit the direct computation of a site amplification function through the recorded time history data converted to spectra from which an amplification transfer function is determined. However, major fundamental unknowns exist in our ability to use the low amplitude microseism data to predict amplification under large magnitude earthquakes. Nonlinear ground response effects and magnitude scaling are key factors which must be evaluated before we can consider microseism data as capable of predicting site amplification for earthquakes. Phase I: Microseisms are the numerous small earthquake events which occur daily. Strong motion data such as the 1989 Loma Prieta event recorded on Treasure Island and Yerba Buena is to be processed by Fourier analysis to compute a transfer function which will serve as a full scale benchmark of actual observed amplification. Yerba Buena is a rock outcrop while Treasure Island is a site of known high amplification. Instrumentation is to be installed on Treasure Island and on the bed rock at Yerba Buena Island in the same locations as the earthquake strong motion instrumentation is installed and microseism data is to be recorded. Results will be evaluated and reported. Phase II: Some nonlinear effects of the ground response which will influence the amplification functions are expected. An independent method using material properties and nonlinear analysis will be used to validate microseism amplification results and predictions. The nonlinear response and earthquake magnitude effects which will influence the amplification functions are to be evaluated using finite element analysis and wave propagation analysis. A fundamental part of this research is to develop an understanding of the basic process of site amplification. Phase III: Develop procedures, equipment and supporting documentation to permit systems to be obtained and procedures defined for conducting analysis. Provide technology transfer in the form of training sessions at Navy Engineering Field Divisions. Commercial Potential: This research has full potential for non-DOD applications. It will impact civilian construction both at waterfront areas and at other sites where high plasticity clays are found. Users are the civil engineering profession and construction industry.

However, there is little experimental work to demonstrate that the gains can be economically realized in practice. This project will demonstrate these gains by building an integrated circuit utilizing fully depleted deep sub-micrometer gate length FETs on BESOI material.

The drive pulses are provided by High Voltage Modulators, which are usually very expensive and complicated. As switching elements are currently used vacuum tubes, thyratrons or Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCR's), which all have significant drawbacks. Recently, in an exploratory developments carried out under contract to NRL, VARIAN has developed a working model of a Magnetron modulator, using paralleled strings of cascaded field effect switching transistors, employing commercially available transistors with relatively low drain voltages.

Each element of the focal plane detector surface defines one of many ""beams"" simultaneously receiving energy scattered (or emitted in a passive mode) from the corresponding directions. Focal plane array elements suitable for the active/passive concept have already been demonstrated [1] in the form of a 1"" square, 4X4 element ""tile"" on monolithic GaAs. An array of such tiles would be placed in the focal plane of a 2 to 3 foot Rexolite lens. In the active mode, an EIO transmitter illuminates the set of .2 degree beams with 10 us pulses at about 1000 per second. Energy received at each element is range-gated and integrated for an exposure time slightly less than the normal 1/30 second TV frame interval.

It has been shown [2] that reliable, real-time detection of important target patterns can only be accomplished by such a radar. Although the cost of a focal plane array radar will eventually be comparable to conventional radars, hard evidence of this claim is needed prior to model development. Phase I: A 4-month study will result in a test plan involving airport runways, ship wakes, and other topology typical of militarily important targets. The study will also focus on computer models to provide means for extrapolating single-beam experimental data to expected multiple-beam images of a focal-plane array radar.

Aside from the lack of a US source, the Lyot filter has other shortcomings. It is complex, fragile and limited to the 5000 to 8000 Angstrom bandpass. As well, side-band suppression is not always adequate. Utilizing holographic or other modern optical techniques, it should be possible to develop a narrow band filter with a bandpass as narrow as 0.125 Angstrom that could be manufactured for use at any wavelength in the region from the UV to the IR, tunable for at least 1 Angstrom about the central wavelength.

Solar blind, low dark current response has been observed in diamond photoconductors, and integrating photoresponse has been seen in diamond MIS devices. However, diamond suffers from a lack of shallow dopants. It also lacks a native oxide. This facilitates stable, VUV detection but makes it difficult to fabricate high performance charge transfer devices.

A planar phased array for scanning in one dimension is currently being assembled. A promising method for adding two-dimensional scanning in an affordable manner is the incorporation of a diode lens in front of the one-dimensional-scan phased array. To reduce the size, weight, cost, insertion loss and to increase its bandwidth of the diode lens, a research study should be performed. Phase I: Conduct a 6 month study of risk reduction associated with diode lens antenna. The risk reduction objectives are (1) Reduce the size, weight and insertion loss of the diode lens (2) Increase bandwidth of the diode lens. To reduce the size, weight, cost and insertion loss of the diode lens, a research study should be performed to increase the maximum phase shift per diode strip to 45 degrees (It is presently 22.5 degrees) and increase the spacing between diode strips. Phase II: For an affordable phased array radar, the combination of a diode lens (to scan in the elevation plane) and a slotted waveguide array with a high power phase shifter associated with each column (in order to scan the beam in the azimuth plane) should be integrated. Thus, in phase II a diode lens will be built, integrated, and tested with NRL's 6.2 ONR radar.

State-of-the-art cavity, electrical-substitution radiometers have been developed that promise to achieve this, but they have yet to be integrated into an operational, robust system for field use on remote platforms. Phase I: Develop a concept/breadboard radiometric sensing system with flat spectral response from the UV to the far IR, capable of reliable long term monitoring. The radiometer sensitivity should be significantly increased over existing cavity-type radiometers. Ultraviolet filters to use with the radiometer s should be identified and incorporated into the system design, and have high out-of-band blocking when the sensor is illuminated with solar radiation.

A means to aggregate the data and a communications network which rapidly transmits data in a useable form to training and operational commands is required. Phase I: Conduct a 6 month study to determine the feasibility of developing a feedback network which rapidly provides human performance data to both Navy training and operational commands.

The system would integrate several systems recently proven to be effective by research, into a single system operating on a standard PC.","The Navy and other services have supported considerable research investigating how to improve the readability of technical documentation to enhance user comprehension. This includes the work of Thomas Bever (U. of Rochester) on text formatting, David Kieras (U. of Michigan) and Bruce Britton (U. of Georgia) on computer-based text critiquing systems, and George Miller (Princeton U.) on the lexical WordNet database and associated `filter' that tells the writer when rare and unfamiliar words are being used. These systems represent a considerable advance over current commercial software because they are based on the latest cognitive and linguistics theory. Now, they can be incorporated into a single, user-friendly, system for writers. Since current standards for technical documentation often require the use of a readability formula, the system should also incorporate the capability to compute an accepted readability formula. The contractor should have expertise in computational linguistics and HCI interface design. Phase I: Based on an assessment of the existing applications, design a system to aid writers and demonstrate insofar as possible by linking together existing software. System design should consider the following design issues: (a) -Design of the writer's interface; (b) -The optimal type of feedback to writers that affects text usability; (c)-Providing writers the option and the rationale for choosing between an approach (e.g., Kieras) which requires conforming to language that the system can parse, or an approach (e.g., Britton) that aids writers to do a similar manual analysis of their text; (d) -How to advise writers about preparing text for readers' cognitive strategies; (e) -How writers can use readability scores in conjunction with other system facilities to improve writing. Phase II: Build integrated system and make available to Navy for testing by authors of training materials. Conduct a test and evaluation.

Aircraft Systems for naval aviation differ significantly from those of other services in that they must operate in a maritime environment, including those conditions associated with the aircraft carrier and other air-capable ships. The environments include: corrosion/salt spray, deck and elevator space limitations, size/weight restrictions, longer missions, over and underwater egress and survivability, turbulence and deck motion, precision controls, shipboard electromagnetics, unique visual conditions, special night operations, high lift, low speed, rapid engine response, special landing gear, special supportability and maintainability considerations (no cranes, no ladders, self-contained repair, etc.) and general aircraft performance in these severe conditions. The components and systems developed must be affordable, sustainable and supportable.

Sonar performance in shallow water has been demonstrated to have a higher false alarm rate than deep water environments. Signal processing techniques capable of sorting target from non-target are required to successfully operate in these areas. Improvements in shipboard signal processing capabilities using advanced processing technology will make it possible to realize the implementation of computationally intensive processing algorithm which have not been possible in the past. Active classification research efforts to date have identified a number of promising processing techniques to extract the maximum information possible out of an active waveform. We desire to improve classification reliability while reducing the threshold between detection and classification. Specific examples of advanced processing techniques include the use of time frequency/time scale analysis, programming by pictures, and the use of higher order moments to improve classification. The proposed solution will examine a number of advanced processing techniques which have previously been promising but which have not been affordable because they were computational intensive. Alternatives for time frequency, graph object, and time scale analysis all of which focus on improving their solution of parameters required to correctly classify a target are needed. Higher order moments associated with real world, non-gauss active returns may also improve classification.

Growing numbers of applications stand to benefit from the application of formal-methods techniques. Society is increasingly at risk because of the lack of their application as recently witnessed with the floating point arithmetic failure of the Intel Pentium microprocessor which did not verify the correctness of its design.

Management information systems must handle information which might be uncertain, probabilistic, non-monotonic, temporal, default, propositional, or fuzzy. Often such information arises in real world situations (e.g., when only partial information is available, or information is hypothetical). Current language standards (e.g., SQL) do not fully address the range of possible information type interactions. This can lead to inconsistent results. For example, the use of null values in a DBMS may lead to query results different from a DBMS that uses default values for representing partial information. Another example involves material implication of classical logic. With the closed-world assumption material implication can be easily expressed as a propositional statement; however, in a context where both propositions and facts are uncertain, this identification may not be warranted.

The lack of understanding of these conditions and rules of inference may lead to problems in the fusion of information.",172,1212,1,No,No,No,,"Develop a mathematical basis for the fusion of different types of information as mentioned above; identify problems where current approaches may lead to inconsistencies, contradictions, or the absence of meaningful information; and develop approaches to identify and remove circularities, redundancies and inconsistencies in a knowledge base.","Develop a functional prototype that is operable with and extends a standard query language (e.g., SQL or KQML) that is based on the results of Phase I.

One modification that has not been exploited in the ship environment is the opportunity to introduce considerable amounts of clean water into the engine cycle. Recent advances in the production of fresh water from salt and brackish waters have now made it possible to consider water addition to engine cycles at rates equal to or greater than the fuel flow. It is known that if significant amounts of water are available, new thermodynamic cycles can be constructed so as to improve efficiency, raise power density, and/or reduce exhaust emissions. All of these characteristics have particular benefit to Naval applications where power plant and fuel occupy a large fraction of the platform. In addition, the detectability and survivability of a Naval ship are also quite dependent on the emissions and reliability of the power plant. It is therefore desired to examine how the thermodynamic, fluid control, and combustion chemistry effects of air breathing ship engines can be re-optimized through the introduction of water to various locations of existing or appropriately modified Naval engine configurations.",192,1255,1,No,No,No,,"Identify modifications to thermodynamic cycles using water augmentation, and develop optimization procedures.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: Many engine types used on Naval ships are also used on commercial ships. While the Naval optimization is different, a large part of the new water addition technology will be transferable. By bringing the engine manufacturer into the development, it is expected that the commercial applications will be accelerated, especially for engines with demonstrated performance. In addition, this technology should show considerable promise for land based engines where water is available, for example in power plants. The commercial potential seems highest in the areas of reduced pollution from exhaust gases and increased power density.",1,,,0,0,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/61610/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/61610/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,95.3 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:02:19,,,,,N95-087_61610,DOD_SBIR_95_P1_C3_N95-087,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:09.489124+00

However, active control methods have some limitations and drawbacks that additional research and development efforts are needed for further implementations. These efforts include optimal placement for sensors and actuators, effective control strategy, and affordable control system components. For active control of sound radiation from structures, it is more effective to use structural sensing technique at the nearfield to estimate the far-field acoustic pressure. Collocated sensor/actuator control technique is stable, robust, and economical if the sensors and actuators are integrated properly. To be effective, control algorithms must be model-independent and do not require excessive computing.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: This technology would have direct applications to control noise and vibration on vibrating structures, such as aircraft structure, machinery, ground transportation vehicles, and home appliances. Several structural dynamics software programs are now used by the industry in crashworthiness analyses and other severe impact applications. In addition hydro codes have been developed for the simulation of shock and underwater explosions. None of these codes is capable of simulating the fracture process in large submerged structures, because they rely on finite element or finite difference which use structured meshes. Finite element methods are quite limited in their capabilities to simulate fracture, because cracks can generally only be modeled along the directions of the element edges. Therefore, modeling of arbitrary crack growth by finite elements requires continuous remeshing. The major breakthrough has been the development of the Element-Free Galerkin (EFG) computational method that is able to simulate fracture very accurately. This method is often called a meshless or gridless method, as the method requires only nodes. The interpolants which are used for the unknowns are moving least-square interpolants. In the EFG method, arbitrary cracks can move through the solid, and the problem of interest is modeled by a set of nodes and a Computer Aided Design-like model for the outside and inside surfaces of the structure, including any cracks which are modeled. The analyst does not have to know where cracks are emanating from and which direction they are propagating. Crack initiation and propagation criteria are provided by the user; the program then implants nodes and moves nodes in the direction of the crack with no elements or connectivity to be tracked.

Ships, aircraft, land combat vehicles and submarines will be operational well-past their planned service lives thereby introducing a new set of challenges for fleet operators and maintainers. Accordingly, both the Safety and Logistics Round Tables identified the transition to ""Condition Based Maintenance"" and the maturing of mechanical diagnostics technologies as their number one priority. Mechanical diagnostics technologies emerging from the Navy S&T community will allow onboard, realtime processing of data to accurately determine machinery health. These technologies will be available commercially in three to five years. Although information vital to safety and weapons system readiness will be generated by onboard processors, present man-machine interface technologies are not capable of providing usable information onboard, in realtime. To harness the enormous power of integrated mechanical diagnostics systems, new approaches to man machine interface need to be explored.

Contractor will deliver a flight-ready MMI system within one year of the beginning of Phase II. The flight system will also incorporate limited embedded training and video electronic tech-manual capabilities for off-board use by H-46 maintenance technicians using the helmet mounted display while on aircraft main or auxiliary power.,"Transitions of MMI-technologies include the entire Navy and Marine Corps helicopter fleet of approximately 1200 aircraft. An immediate transition opportunity may be the H-46 program where the Program Manager has voiced a desire for integrated diagnostics systems as part of a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the H-46. Another immediate opportunity is the U.S. Army CH-47 Program that is now planning integrated diagnostics for that aircraft in a modernization program. The British MoD is also very interested in these technologies. No investment in onboard, realtime MMI is taking place in Europe. We anticipate that the contractor would team with the diagnostics system provider to incorporate MMI technologies as an integral part of a realtime, onboard integrated mechanical diagnostics system. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: There is a vast commercial market for MMI technologies worldwide. New technologies are increasing the power of mechanical diagnostics systems while dramatically lowering the cost. As such, the commercial customer base becomes (nearly) open-ended. Whether helmet mounted, goggle mounted or flat panel displays, the new technologies emerging from this SBIR will be tremendously valuable to the performer. In the emerging market for the next generation of realtime mechanical diagnostics systems, MMI will be a multi-billion dollar industry.

Many applications will require the integration of multiple chips into tightly interacting subsystems where neural messages must travel from one chip to another or from one circuit board to another with proper accounting for message delays. Since analog neurons integrate signals in time, the communication system must not introduce latencies or variabilities that interfere with the neural integration mechanism. The goal of this SBIR is to develop a system that can 1) represent neural events taking place at a variety of sparse locations, 2) transport and route the event messages with adequate time representation, and 3) scale gracefully to very large multichip and multiboard systems using modular circuit board techniques with attention to size and power.

Rotor hub and transmission failures in certain helicopters, for example, have lead to a number of unfortunate fatal accidents. Past practice in maintenance is based on the cycle lifetime notion; vehicles and machinery are inspected on definite intervals and parts are replaced based on these inspections. The difficulty with this approach is that it does not work to detect many critical failures. In addition, the inspection process--requiring the dismantling of components--frequently introduces faults. The most tested approach makes use of acoustic sensors or accelerometers to detect adverse vibrations that arise and are associated with a failing component. The difficulty with condition-based maintenance has to do with (1) a general difficulty of knowing which mechanical elements are critical, and (2) the deconvolution of the acoustic signals received from various locations on the entire machine. Sliding solid contacts, such as gears and bearings, are difficult to investigate for the simple reason that it has proved difficult to insert appropriate probes into the interface. Some recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to insert thermocouples, pressure sensing devices, and even spectroscopic probes into the interface between two solid sliding contacts.

Tight financial times have reduced the number of new airliners purchased and have greatly increased the necessary lifetime of the existing fleet.

These materials, having very high thermal capacity and thermodynamic properties (extremely high heats of fusion and specific heat), have already been incorporated into cups, bags, food carts, trays, and related devices. Some commercialization of the technology has already begun, as Pizza Hut, for example, is now using a special tray and heating disk made from these high tech endothermic materials for their delivery service. These disks have demonstrated the ability to maintain a 2-4 pound pizza above 1408F for 90 minutes. Although these endothermic materials have high potential for use in hot water heaters, camping gear, cold weather clothing, boots, fire control applications, and the like, no funding efforts have commenced in these areas. Because these materials are ""heat absorbing"", undergarments impregnated with endothermic agents could essentially extract excess body heat, exhaust such heat to the external environment, and keep the wearer cooler for extended periods of time. Firefighters, race car drivers, and wearers of protective clothing (nuclear and chemical workers, for example) could substantially benefit from these endothermic materials. In cold temperature environments, the heat absorbed from the body by these materials could be prevented from being exhausted and therefore maintain the body's temperature for a longer period of time. Skiers, skaters, oil pipeline workers, and the like could take maximum advantage of this technology in the heating mode.",1,"US Patent 4,446,916, ""Composite Fabric Endothermic Electronic Component Cooling"", May 8, 1984; ""Composite Fabrics Spruce up the Heat Sink"", OUTLOOK, July 2, 1984; ""A Star Wars Legacy: Hot Pizza"", BUSINESS WEEK, Vol. 81, January 17, 1994.; ""Answer Looking for a Problem"" (Ballistic Missile Defense Office technology development), AVIATION WEEK AND TECHNOLOGY, Vol. 15, June 13, 1994.","US Patent 4,446,916, ""Composite Fabric Endothermic Electronic Component Cooling"", May 8, 1984; ""Composite Fabrics Spruce up the Heat Sink"", OUTLOOK, July 2, 1984; ""A Star Wars Legacy: Hot Pizza"", BUSINESS WEEK, Vol. 81, January 17, 1994.; ""Answer Looking for a Problem"" (Ballistic Missile Defense Office technology development), AVIATION WEEK AND TECHNOLOGY, Vol. 15, June 13, 1994.",4,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/61630/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/61630/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,95.3 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:02:25,,,,,N95-104_61630,DOD_SBIR_95_P1_C3_N95-104,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:09.489124+00

Higher life cycle costs of equipment, reduced operational availability, and excessive manpower requirements to maintain operability are some of the problems associated with corrosion. Current corrosion control methods, as well as some aspects of weapon system designs, have been identified as Naval requirements. Recent surveys of fleet vehicles have targeted several areas requiring the conduct of research and development of new corrosion resistant materials, coatings and procedures to prevent and combat corrosion problems. One persistent problem found repeatedly throughout the investigation was the general corrosion, pitting and crevice corrosion found on several vehicles' engine and exhaust systems. Typical applications to be targeted include engine exhaust manifolds, exhaust pipes, mufflers, and protective screening. These areas of the vehicle are exposed to severe environments where coatings often fail. Consequently, heavy amounts of corrosion can be found in these areas where coatings either fail or are never applied necessitating the need for a more extensive and durable coating.

When the direction of arrival of an interfering signal is very close to the direction of arrival of a signal of interest (e.g., beamwidths) super-resolution techniques provide means of distinguishing between signals.

However, designing new CASE tools to meet this need appears prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.

CASE tools for INFOSEC threat analysis do not exist, and available threat information is disjoint and extremely difficult to use by either trained certifiers or by high-level decision makers.

That tool will contain a database of actual attacks against Navy systems (or analogous systems). When queried, the tool will ask for high-level descriptive data about the proposed system and then return a profile of likely threat scenarios. However, the prototype system will not show a graphical description of the proposed system nor use an expert system shell to reason about likely threat scenarios. The Navy would like to explore the adaptation of existing (non-INFOSEC) CASE tools with good graphical system display capabilities and expert system shells to build a follow-on to the initial prototype.

This work may also apply to other airbreathing propulsion engines, such as turbines, pulse detonation engines and scramjets.","Good performance of a liquid fueled propulsion system for a wide range of operating conditions requires a means for metering the fuel flow to the engine. This has been accomplished in the past by an electromechanical cavitating venture valve, fluidic control valve and other technologies. These valves in general have been high cost, have a high pressure drop and are relatively large. The current state-of-the-art valve fits into a 3"" x 4"" x 6"" box. Gains in liquid fuel missile propulsion performance can be realized with higher density, higher viscosity fuels which become attractive with compact, low cost, lightweight fuel management components. Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) valves have been developed for the automotive and space industries. PM valves offer the advantage of compactness, in line installation with the fuel line(s) and integrated electronics. Their use in the automotive industry has dictated a need for low costs, low operating pressures (3000 psi) with large pressure drops. The operating frequency for these valves has been less than 200 Hz. The current needs for a ramjet engine require moderate operating pressures up to 500 psi for a maximum fuel flow rate of 11.5 Gam; or for a maximum fuel flow rate of 2.9 gam. If four valves are used in parallel. The pressure drop across the valve should be minimal (<50 psi) at the maximum fuel flow rate. A fuel management system study has shown that a fuel flow rate turndown ratio of 15:1 is needed. The current technology in PM valves offers a metering capability of about 4:1. A large variation in fuel flow rate delivery to combustor is not acceptable, thus higher operating frequencies or a means of damping the fuel flow perturbations downstream of the valve is needed.

As a result, in accordance with MIL-STD-1688, ultrasonic inspections are now allowed in place of radiographic inspections. Additional savings in inspection costs, along with improvements in quality and reliability could be provided with improved characterization of the discontinuities in the weld metal. Currently, the Navy (NAVSEA 08) is using ultrasonic systems which automate the data collection process for in-service inspections. The analysis and interpretation of the signatures still requires both post-processing and human interaction, which is labor intensive and requires considerable training. Laboratory research at the Naval Surface Warfare Center has demonstrated that automatic sizing and classification of the weld discontinuities is now possible with current advances in sizing technology and classification algorithms. Thus, to reduce inspection costs, the Navy requires a real-time system which is capable of automatically sizing and characterizing the discontinuities. Such an automated system will yield improved quality assurance and permit improved acceptance criteria standards reducing the number required inspections and repairs. Capabilities of this real-time system should support discontinuity detection and sizing, classification of the discontinuity type (ie. crack, lack-of-fusion, porosity, void, etc.), and application of an acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria should parallel MIL-STD 2035(SH), and incorporate the capability to accept or reject the discontinuity based on: the ultrasonic signature amplitude, size of the discontinuity, proximity of neighboring discontinuities, and the type of the discontinuity. This system must support inspection of hull welds under as-welded conditions, thus the capability for both angle-beam and normal-incidence inspection modes is required.

In the case of Navy ships which routinely send and receive fuel while at sea and daily conduct internal transfers of fuel, the preferred mechanism would be a shipboard system.

Regardless of bore size, the total handling length of the OV shall not exceed 30 inches with a total weight not to exceed 35 pounds in the 120 mm diameter configuration. The design of the OV and the materials used for its construction shall be optimized to maximize payload capacity and vehicle strength while minimizing parasitic weight and vehicle signature (audio, visual, RF and infrared). The OV may the launched with or without rocket assist. The design of the base of the OV shall be adaptable to this form of propulsion and shall be capable of cleanly separating form this interface. The OV shall be fitted with a low drag nose shape and a self-starting, power plant which will sustain the vehicle in a loiter pattern at 10,000 feet altitude for a minimum of 3 hours. The power plant may be nose or tail mounted and shall provide a minimum of 100 watts of power continuously for the entire time of loiter. The gun launched version of the OV shall utilize a government supplied control actuator system (CAS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), GPS receiver (GPS/Rx), two-way communication link (COM link) and sensor package (SP).

Unlike aircraft, UAV, or missile sensors, gun-fired sensors must be much lower cost and smaller, and their data links must be similarly small. Also, a key advantage of the gun is its fast response, and data links that require long setup periods are self-defeating. The data link desired for this topic would be capable of being gun launched as part of an observation vehicle with a video camera sensor, and transmit this video back to the firing ship from a distance of 50-100 miles. The camera would be either a commercial-quality CCD imager (768x494 pixel, 24 bit color), or a lower resolution infrared imager. Two observation vehicles are under consideration: a parafoil with ten-minute mission time, and a winged vehicle with a three-hour mission time. Line of sight to the ship would be maintained with a gun-launched relay similar to the observation vehicle, without its sensor but with room for a larger transmitter or more power. Only point-to-point operation on a dedicated channel is required-networking is not. Minimizing the cost of the expended projectile is the primary concern, even if the cost of the shipboard receiver is increased. The targets will be primarily tactical battlefield targets like artillery batteries, infantry positions, logistic sites, vehicles, and landing zones. The sensor must support single frames at full resolution but lower frame rate to support identification and battle damage assessment. A desirable capability would be to allow the operator to designate areas of interest that will be transmitted at higher quality with the background at lower quality. The observation vehicle will be equipped with GPS and an inertial navigator. The data link may make use of these components, for example, to provide timing and synchronization, or to assist in video compression by providing knowledge of camera motion.

The goal is the ability to use SBD output as ADS input and vise-versa.,"SBD has been shown to provide cost savings in the development of large military systems through the early detection and resolution of problems that require prototypes or mock-ups to visualize. The key advantages are using information at the earliest possible opportunity to visualize the system, and collection of information from all domains into a coherent system model. For instance, knowledge of the landing characteristics of a given aircraft intended to be housed on a given surface vessel may be used to avoid costly miscalculations in hangar door size or light placement, even if both the aircraft and the surface vessel are still on the ""drawing board"". Executable computer models of each system can be created to ensure that the dynamics of one do not interfere with the other. In another area of technology, ADS is being used to provide cost savings in acquisition and enhanced fidelity of experimentation, test and evaluation and training. These simulations are carried out via various distributed networks available allowing the integrated exercise of executable models, databases, prototypes and mock-ups and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) without relocating all of the elements involved to one central site or substituting improper or inconsistent modules. In order to execute all of the models as if they were a part of the same system, certain protocols must be embedded within the models which accept, interpret and act upon messages according to the behavior of the system represented. These models must also emit messages which indicate the response of the modeled system to its stimuli. Models built with SBD are highly integrated with the parts and domains of the system under development, but are rarely compatible with the models used in ADS. That is to say, if they exist, SBD models lack the structure and protocols necessary to respond to messages defined for such simulations. This is unfortunate, since it represents a disconnect of the type that both technologies are hoping to avoid; providing access to design information as soon as it is known in order to evaluate the total design. Reasons include the fact that the SBD model is usually a ""work-in-progress"", while the ADS model is static; the tools for SBD are not developed with ADS in mind; and certain required characteristics of an ADS model are not necessary in an SBD model (e.g. real-time response). What is needed is a technique for the automatic translation or enhancement of an existing SBD model or construction of such a model if none exists to conform to protocols for execution in an ADS exercise. This would provide two benefits. First, once a particular design has reached a stable configuration, it would allow developers of other related systems to assess the impact of design decisions made in its development. Second, it would allow the designers to assess the impact of critical changes to the design using the very latest and highest fidelity external data from models or fielded systems.",485,2992,1,No,No,No,,"Development of the technique for the enhancement of SBD models which comply to protocols for ADS.

Numerous bacterial, viral and parasitic agents are known to cause periodic diarrhea outbreaks, but enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic Campylobacter and Shigella bacteria have been most frequently recovered from deployed forces experiencing acute episodes of diarrhea or dysentery. Although all of these pathogens have missionabortive potential, illnesses caused by Campylobacter or Shigella are the most severe. Both pathogens invade intestinal tissues, causing fever and bloody diarrhea. In field situations, laboratory diagnosis is usually not possible because the necessary materials and equipment are generally not transportable, and because performance of conventional tests require a high degree of specialized skill. Clinically, these agents cause disease which is easily confused with other febrile illnesses, such as malaria and dengue fever. Without an accurate laboratory diagnosis, treatment of severe cases can be complicated because the genera differ significantly in antibiotic susceptibility profiles.

Removing the required human interface for refueling will reduce or eliminate some of the environmental impact associated with fuel transfer. Autonomous refueling will remove military personnel form potentially hazardous environments while increasing the efficiency of the refueling process.,"Robo fuel will consist of more than just a robotic arm with a fuel hose attached. Robo fuel will be a system which includes the robotic arm, but also incorporates modifications or adapters to the receipt vehicle fuel system. The major components of the system are: • robotic arm 15 - 20' long, with fuel conduit and bayonet type nozzle on the end • positioning beacon on the receipt vehicle which the robotic arm will sense and locate the refueling port • information transfer connection so the robot can dispense the required amount of fuel • adapter kit to incorporate double sealed (double sealed so outer seal prevents dirt and water from entering the system, the inner seal prevents fuel leakage from the tank) bayonet fitting on receipt vehicle • information transfer connection which tells the robot the allowed flowrate for the receipt vehicle The concept of operation is that a driver can pull into the station (or a mobile refueler can be brought along side) and be responsible only to get the vehicle refueling port within some allowable proximity of the robotic arm. At this point, the driver turns on the positioning beacon which wakes up the robot. The robotic arm will sense the position of the refueling port and automatically ""stab"" the bayonet nozzle into the port. The information contacts are made automatically at this point, and the receipt vehicle communicates to the robot the required amount of fuel and the allowable refueling rate (large trucks and heavy equipment for example can accept fuel at a much higher rate than automobiles). When the receipt vehicle is ""full"" the arm retracts into its neutral position awaiting the next vehicle. Robo fuel can be built as an attachment to existing refueling vehicles, built into a dedicated refueling vehicle, or as a stationary system.

COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: With everybody wanting faster and easier services, this could be employed by the gas station industry. The customer could drive up, insert his/her bank card into a fixture located at the drivers window, then receive fuel without leaving the vehicle. The system will be environmentally friendly because the bayonet nozzle would allow true vapor recovery, and should eliminate spilled fuel. The system also has application to any commercial organization that operates a fleet of vehicles which are serviced at a central location. While the vehicle is receiving fuel, maintenance data (vehicle identification, odometer reading, etc) could be transferred to a central computer for improved maintenance scheduling. The military could benefit from this system just as a commercial fleet.

The first catapult was a cable type driven by a flywheel. Follow-on types included pneumatic, explosive and hydraulic. These were all indirect drive mechanisms. Today's aircraft carriers employ direct drive steam powered catapults. These systems were developed in the 1950's, are heavy, large, inefficient, manpower intensive, are completely dependent on the ship's propulsion system, reduce the structural life of all seabased airframes and are at the limit of their performance capabilities. The Navy desires that it's future seabased tactical aviation platforms be physically smaller and more efficient in terms of space utilization, machinery and operations. For aircraft launch and recovery operations this means making more efficient use of the flight deck real estate (i.e. reducing the area required for launch and recovery) and in reducing the impact to ship operations (i.e. reducing the required wind over deck). US Navy efforts conducted in the 1970's, along with operational experience gained by other Navies, demonstrated the tremendous benefits provided by utilizing Ski-Jump technology in the launch of VSTOL aircraft. Benefits in terms of reduced take-off distance, increased payload capability and reduced stress imparted to the airframe have been demonstrated. Studies have also shown that similar benefits are to be gained for CTOL aircraft by incorporating a launch assist device into the ski-jump. In addition to supplying kinetic energy to the aircraft, the launch assist device would also serve to act as a guide for STOVL aircraft allowing takeoffs in out-of-wind/ship motion conditions and provide aircraft directional control when approaching minimum single engine control speeds. This type of configuration would also be extremely beneficial for Marine Corps CTOL and VSTOL aircraft launch operations from Expeditionary Airfields. A low energy aircraft launch assist device is needed to permit the launching of CTOL, VSTOL and STOVL aircraft from future seabased tactical aviation platforms and landbased Expeditionary Airfields. This device must fully integrate with a ski jump. To minimize the ship impact, in terms of lost deck spots, and to optimize the launch angle for different aircraft, the ski jump will be a curvilinear ramp fully adjustable from 0 degrees through 8 degrees. The launch device must function within this constraint. The length of the launch assist device must be contained within the total length of the ski jump which will not exceed 200 ft. The device must operate with closed loop feedback control. The energy output of the device must be adjustable from 5 to 60 million ft lbs.

Predicting the degree and extent of these destructive effects is often difficult, particularly when targets are near civilian population centers. Accordingly, there is an emerging requirement for weapon payloads which can degrade an adversary's military capability while at the same time minimizing or eliminating the destructive effect on civilian populations. Since any effective military capability depends heavily on motorized equipment, a weapon payload which inhibits the operation of combustion engines would be highly effective. At the same time, such a Fuel Combustion Inhibitor (FCI) payload would have little or no destructive effect on civilian populations or property.

The design of conventional boosters can be accomplished using modern reactive flow hydrocodes. To meet Insensitive Munitions requirements, modern explosives are often very shock insensitive. A promising concept for initiating shock insensitive main charge explosives uses an insensitive booster explosive to drive a flyer plate into the booster/main charge interface. This results in a very high pressure shock of short duration which produces a detonation in the main charge in a very short run distance. Analysis of the flyer plate booster with a conventional Eulerian reactive flow hydrocode. Shockwave Multimaterial Eulerian Reactive Flow (SMERF), shows that the detonation, once formed in the main charge, may then fail due to corner turning effects. These corner turning effects highlight the weaknesses of our current codes. Results obtained from these analyses were shown to be dependent on the computational mesh size, since the reaction zone of the detonation wave is very thin and it could not be resolved.

This thrust is primarily motivated by a requirement to reduce operating costs. Costs associated with the human crew typically comprise 40 to 50% of a ship's operational and support costs. The constraints on reducing ship's manning include the potential impacts on: mission effectiveness, crew safety, crewman workload, and human performance capability. Historically, the most frequently applied method to reduce ship manning has been to automate tasks previously performed by a human, thereby reducing workload and manning requirements. This approach is not always effective due to an inadequate allocation of functions to human performance and automation, and to a failure to consider the most effective integration of the human in automated system operation. Human systems integration (HSI) application in early system design and development specifically addresses the allocation of functions issue, as well as the required roles of the human and automation, and the design of workstations, human-machine interfaces, jobs, procedures, and training systems to reduce human error, accidents, workloads, task complexity, and required skills for human performance in a reduced manning environment. The potential for reducing manning beyond the use of automation, through HSI techniques such as improved task simplification, decision aiding, and improved design for operability and maintainability, has been well demonstrated. The Naval Research Advisory Council, in a review of the status of man-machine technology in the Navy, estimated that the application of human-centered design methods in system design will result in a 20% reduction in required manning levels. What is needed now is to automate HSI methods and data which will result in effective and safe ship manning reductions.

While the primary mission of the LCS is naval surface fire support (NSFS), it is desirable that the LCS have residual capability in short range anti - air and short range anti - surface missions. Examples of these threats include low flying, high speed, maneuvering cruise missiles and small, agile surface craft. The LCS may function in any or all of the three operational modes: active, passive, or semi-active, however, all semi-active systems must be compatible with designator already in service with the US armed forces.

The monition will autonomously guide itself onto the target area based on initial data loaded into the round either prior to launch or via uplink communications. The navigation and attitude control computer (NAC), on board the projectile, will activate the LCS and gather and process information from the projectile's IMU and LCS to implement terminal guidance toward the target. A two-way data path between the NAC and LCS should be assumed. It is highly desirable that the LCS be ""strapped-down"" to minimize complexity, cost and packaging volume and to maximize structural integrity. For design and analysis purposes. It may be assumed that the forward section of the projectile containing the LCS yaw, pitch and roll stabilized and that flight states and target positions are known by the NAC and may be used to stabilize seeker outputs and estimate range and time-to-go to target impact.

The terminal guidance algorithm (software) implemented by LCS shall be considered part of this development. Implementation of the terminal guidance algorithm shall be performed by the NAC. The LCS shall include low-drag, optical elements and/or wave guides, signal processing electronics and software, exclusive of power source.

The LCS shall have a field of view of at least 10 degrees. It is highly desirable that the LCS output electronic signals proportional to the error angle over the entire field of view of the seeker. The field of view of the LCS may be biased at a fixed angle if necessary to enhanced performance. For design and analysis purposes, it may be assumed that the airframe is descending into the target area on a 20 degree glide slope at 300 m/s and can produce 1 G of lateral acceleration for every 5 degrees of airframe angle of attack. The LCS shall occupy no more than the first 6.5 of the projectile nose length of a 3 caliber 80% secant ogive. In its tactical configuration, the LCS shall be capable of operating within specification for at least 30 seconds after activation by the NAC and after the application of at least 20,000 G's of set back acceleration in line with the be 3,000 and 10,000 G's, respectively.

The specific military application of this approach is to provide a control section for a guided projectile, which places the guidance and control elements (fins, actuators, electronics, antennas, and inertial components) in an aerodynamically despun section, using the despinning reaction to power the projectile. This approach permits the projectile to fly with a low-drag finless configuration at its initial high velocity, and allows a common component (a generator) to provide both electrical power and one axis of control.

This comes from the goal of developing an upgrade to the 5"" Mk45 gun that will produce muzzle energies in the 18-22MJ range. Increasing muzzle energy of the gun requires enhanced propulsion charges. This means more energetic propellant in larger volumes. A longer barrel is required to allow sufficient in-bore volume for complete combustion of the propellant and expansion of propellant gases to keep muzzle exit pressure within the allowable shipboard limit. The longer barrel also allows the pressure to act on the projectile for a longer time, thus producing a higher muzzle velocity (higher muzzle energy) even with the existing propulsion charges. The purpose of this SBIR is to investigate the use of high strength graphite composite material as an overwrap on a significant portion of a reduced thickness barrel near the muzzle will allow a 70 caliber barrel to be fabricated with similar weight, moment and moment-of-inertia characteristics to the current 54 caliber barrels. Such a barrel would eliminate the need for major modifications to the train and elevation drives of the Mk 45 gun system that would be necessary with a similar steel barrel. Thus, making the barrels interchangeable. Current commercial applications for pressure vessels deal largely with steady-state pressure systems which undergo only small pressure fluctuations, thus not bringing about the fatigue problems commonly present in gun barrels. These vessels are used for low temperature operation only, due to degradation of the epoxy binder at high temperatures.

The submunition will align its own low-quality INS to the carrier's GPS/INS, so that when released, it will guide itself to its aimpoint.","Micro-machined inertial components (accelerometers and gyroscopes) are projected to be available in large quantities at very low cost, due to the demand from the automotive industry. Detroit will be using these sensors primarily as rate sensors: for example, to measure deceleration for air bag deployment or turn rate for active skid control. But these sensors can also be used in a military-style inertial navigator, provided they can be accurately calibrated and initialized. Such navigators can then be used for military and commercial navigation applications, and would be particularly useful where other more accurate navigation is sporadically available. In the military application, this situation occurs when a GPS guided projectile encounters jamming, or when a submuntion is released from a carrier vehicle. In the commercial sector, GPS becomes unreliable in cities, in the canyons between tall buildings, because of multipath, and under heavy tree cover. The Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) program is developing gun projectiles and missiles that will use the Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial navigation for its guidance. If a submunition were equipped with a low cost inertial navigator based on automotive-grade micro-machined inertial technology, and a comparably low cost control system, it could align its navigator the high quality GPS/INS of the carrier vehicle, and when released, fly for a limited time with enough accuracy to hit 80 percent of the targets in the NSFS target set. Such an Inertially Guided Submunition must operate to meet the following specifications: Submunitions must survive a 30,000 G gun launch from a 5""/54 gun to 63 nautical miles. The submunition will be released up to one minute before target impact. On release it will be able to divert 2 kilometers from its ballistic impact point, and have sufficient additional control authority to compensate for environmental effects such as wind. Required accuracy is 3-15 meters (taking the carrier's GPS/INS as truth). Submunitions will be dispensed at Mach 0.8 or below, either individually or in clusters, with each submunition individually and separately targeted. Payload is not to exceed 0.5 kilogram.

Transition would be to the Naval Surface Fire Support program, with additional possibilities in strike warfare. COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL: Low cost miniature inertial sensors, the primary sensor to be developed under this activity, have extensive potential commercial application in measuring and controlling manufacturing processes, general aviation, robotics, industrial automation, medical electronics, sport fitness equipment, personal computer mice, virtual reality, and toys. Integration of commercial inertial measuring components with military-derived navigation methods will provide navigation and position-recording capabilities for automobiles, surveyors, hikers, outdoor workers, and equipment, even when GPS and other external navigation sources are not continuously available. One specific application illustrates this demand: Hikers and other outdoor workers are currently buying GPS navigators in large numbers, but still must carry magnetic compasses because GPS does not have a gyroscope or compass capability. However, the GPS position history can be used to calibrate an inertial navigator that would provide compass, horizon, and vertical measurements, with the added benefit that these measurements would not be affected by the deviation and variation errors of a magnetic compass. The low-cost inertially-guided submunition itself would be applicable to commercial low-velocity projectiles, such as line-throwing guns for sea rescue, tear gas canisters, and non-lethal law-enforcement equipment. (Because of their low velocity, these devices are currently very inaccurate.) Note that the navigation capability is itself dual-use (both military and commercial applications for the navigator), and combines spin-on (use of commercial-grade micro-machined devices from the automobile industry and the underlying commercial silicon production base) with spin-off (use of inertial sensors for navigation, plus the ARPA investment in micro-machining technology).",1,"Elwell, John; Publicover Joseph, ""Silicon Instrument Technology-Strategic Applications"" (Secret), AIAA Missile Sciences Conference, Nov 1994; Elwell, John, ""Micromechanical Inertial Instruments for Commercial and Military Application"", 50th Annual Meeting, Institute of Navigation, June 1994","Elwell, John; Publicover Joseph, ""Silicon Instrument Technology-Strategic Applications"" (Secret), AIAA Missile Sciences Conference, Nov 1994; Elwell, John, ""Micromechanical Inertial Instruments for Commercial and Military Application"", 50th Annual Meeting, Institute of Navigation, June 1994",3,1,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/61470/download/PDF,https://www.dodsbirsttr.mil/topics/api/public/topics/61470/download/PDF,,,,,1,0,0,96.1 Instructions,,,,,,0,0,No,,,,NAVY,,,0,,,,,2025,,,,,,,No,,0,0,,0,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,,,,,2025-08-09 13:03:45,,,,,N96-088_61470,DOD_SBIR_96_P1_C1_N96-088,,1,2025-08-09 19:53:10.424782+00
